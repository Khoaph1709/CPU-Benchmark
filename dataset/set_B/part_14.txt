landscape, which is an inherent and necessary energy in surrounding
objects. So, the character of Italian landscape is curvilinear;
therefore, the outline of the buildings entering into its composition
must be arranged on curvilinear principles, as investigated in § 144.

237. Thirdly. But, if the pervading character can be obtained in the
single object by different means, the contrast will be delightful. Thus,
the elevation of character which the hill districts of Italy possess by
the magnificence of their forms, is transmitted to the villa by its
dignity of detail and simplicity of outline; and the rectangular
interruption to the curve of picturesque blue country, partaking of the
nature of that which it interrupts, is a contrast giving relief and
interest, while any Elizabethan acute angles, on the contrary, would
have been a contrast obtained by the absence of the pervading energy of
the universal curvilinear character, and therefore improper.

238. Fourthly, when the general energy, instead of pervading
simultaneously the multitude of objects, as with one spirit, is
independently possessed and manifested by every individual object, the
result is repetition, not unity; and contrast is not merely agreeable,
but necessary. Thus, a number of objects, forming the line of beauty, is
pervaded by one simple energy; but if that energy is separately
manifested in each, the result is painful monotony. Parallel right
lines, without grouping, are always liable to this objection; and,
therefore, a distant view of a flat country is never beautiful unless
its horizontals are lost in richness of vegetation, as in Lombardy, or
broken with masses of forest, or with distant hills. If none of these
interruptions take place, there is immediate monotony, and no
introduction can be more delightful than such a tower in the distance as
Strasburg, or, indeed, than any architectural combination of verticals.
Peterborough is a beautiful instance of such an adaptation. It is
always, then, to be remembered that repetition is not assimilation.

239. Fifthly, when any attribute is necessarily beautiful, that is,
beautiful in every place and circumstance, we need hardly say that the
contrast consisting in its absence is painful. It is only when beauty is
local or accidental that opposition may be employed.

Sixthly. The _edge_ of all contrasts, so to speak, should be as soft as
is consistent with decisive effect. We mean, that a gradual change is
better than instantaneous transfiguration; for, though always less
effective, it is more agreeable. But this must be left very much to the
judgment.

Seventhly. We must be very careful in ascertaining whether any given
contrast is obtained by freedom from external, or absence of internal,
energy, for it is often a difficult point to decide. Thus, the peace of
the Alpine valley might, at first, seem to be a contrast caused by the
want of the character of strength and sublimity manifested in the hills;
but it is really caused by the freedom from the general and external
influence of violence and desolation.

240. These, then, are principles applicable to all arts, without a
single exception, and of particular importance in painting and
architecture.[53] It will sometimes be found that one rule comes in the
way of another; in which case, the most important is, of course, to be
obeyed; but, in general, they will afford us an easy means of arriving
at certain results, when, before, our conjectures must have been vague
and unsatisfactory.

[Footnote 53: [For further discussion of which, see _Elements of
Drawing_, Letter III.]]

We may now proceed to determine the most proper _form_ for the mountain
villa of England.

241. We must first observe the prevailing lines of the near hills: if
they are vertical, there will most assuredly be monotony, for the
vertical lines of crag are never grouped, and accordingly, by our fourth
rule, the prevailing lines of our edifice must be horizontal. On the
Lake of Thun the tendency of the hills is vertical; this tendency is
repeated by the buildings,[54] and the composition becomes thoroughly
bad; but on the Lake of Como we have the same vertical tendency in the
hills, while the grand lines of the buildings are horizontal, and the
composition is good. But, if the prevailing lines of the near hills be
curved (and they will be either curved or vertical), we must not
interrupt their character, for the energy is then pervading, not
individual; and, therefore, our edifice must be rectangular.

[Footnote 54: [In their turrets and pinnacles, as shown by a poor
wood-cut in the magazine, not worth reproduction.]]

In both cases, therefore, the grand outline of the villa is the same;
but in one we have it set off by contrast, in the other by assimilation;
and we must work out in the architecture of each edifice the principle
on which we have begun. Commencing with that in which we are to work by
contrast: the vertical crags must be the result of violence, and the
influence of destruction, of distortion, of torture, to speak strongly,
must be evident in their every line. We free the building from this
influence, and give it repose, gracefulness, and ease; and we have a
contrast of feeling as well as of line, by which the desirable
attributes are rendered evident in both objects, while the _duration_ of
neither energy being allowed, there can be no disagreeable effect upon
the spectator, who will not shrink from the terror of the crags, nor
feel a want of excitement in the gentleness of the building.

242. Secondly, Solitude is powerful and evident in its effect on the
distant hills; therefore the effect of the villa should be joyous and
life-like (not flippant, however, but serene); and, by rendering it so,
we shall enhance the sublimity of the distance, as we showed in speaking
of the Westmoreland cottage; and, therefore, we may introduce a number
of windows with good effect, provided that they are kept in horizontal
lines, and do not disturb the repose which we have shown to be
necessary.

These three points of contrast will be quite enough: there is no other
external influence from which we can free the building, and the
pervading energy must be communicated to it, or it will not harmonize
with our feelings; therefore, before proceeding, we had better determine
how this contrast is to be carried out in detail.

243. Our lines are to be horizontal; then the roof must be as flat as
possible. We need not think of snow, because, however much we may slope
the roof, it will not slip off from the material, which, here, is the
only proper one; and the roof of the cottage is always very flat, which
it would not be if there were any inconvenience attending such a form.
But, for the sake of the second contrast, we are to have gracefulness
and ease, as well as horizontality. Then we must break the line of the
roof into different elevations, yet not making the difference great, or
we shall have visible verticals. And this must not be done at random.

[Illustration: Fig. 14. Leading lines of Villa-composition.]

244. Take a flat line of beauty, _a d_, fig. 14, for the length of the
edifice. Strike _a b_ horizontally from _a_, _c d_ from _d_; let fall
the verticals, make _c f_ equal _m n_, the maximum; and draw _h f_. The
curve should be so far continued as that _h f_ shall be to _c d_ as _c
d_ to _a b_. Then we are sure of a beautifully proportioned form. Much
variety may be introduced by using different curves; joining parabolas
with cycloids, etc.; but the use of curves is always the best mode of
obtaining good forms.[55]

[Footnote 55: [Compare _Modern Painters_, vol. IV. chap. xvii. § 49, and
_Elements of Drawing_, Letter III.]]

Further ease may be obtained by added combinations. For instance, strike
another curve (_a q b_) through the flat line _a b_; bisect the maximum
_v p_, draw the horizontal _r s_, (observing to make the largest maximum
of this curve towards the smallest maximum of the great curve, to
restore the balance), join _r q_, _s b_, and we have another
modification of the same beautiful form. This may be done in either side
of the building, but not in both.

245. Then, if the flat roof be still found monotonous, it may be
interrupted by garret windows, which must not be gabled, but turned with
the curve _a b_, whatever that may be. This will give instant humility
to the building, and take away any vestiges of Italian character which
might hang about it, and which would be wholly out of place.

The windows may have tolerably broad architraves, but no cornices; an
ornament both haughty and classical in its effect, and, on both
accounts, improper here. They should be in level lines, but grouped at
unequal distances, or they will have a formal and artificial air,
unsuited to the irregularity and freedom around them. Some few of them
may be arched, however, with the curve _a b_, the mingling of the curve
and the square being very graceful. There should not be more than two
tiers and the garrets, or the building will be too high.

So much for the general outline of the villa, in which we are to work by
contrast. Let us pass over to that in which we are to work by
assimilation, before speaking of the material and color which should be
common to both.

246. The grand outline must be designed on exactly the same principles;
for the curvilinear proportions, which were opposition before, will now
be assimilation. Of course, we do not mean to say that every villa in a
hill country should have the form _a b c d_; we should be tired to death
if they had: but we bring forward that form as an example of the
agreeable result of the principles on which we should always work, but
whose result should be the same in no two cases. A modification of that
form, however, will frequently be found useful; for, under the
depression _h f_, we may have a hall of entrance and of exercise, which
is a requisite of extreme importance in hill districts, where it rains
three hours out of four all the year round; and under _c d_ we may have
the kitchen, servants' rooms, and coachhouse, leaving the large division
quiet and comfortable.

247. Then, as in the curved country there is no such distortion as that
before noticed, no such evidence of violent agency, we need not be so
careful about the appearance of perfect peace; we may be a little more
dignified and a little more classical. The windows may be symmetrically
arranged; and, if there be a blue and undulating distance, the upper
tier may even have cornices; narrower architraves are to be used; the
garrets may be taken from the roof, and their inmates may be
accommodated in the other side of the house; but we must take care, in
doing this, not to become Greek. The material, as we shall see
presently, will assist us in keeping unclassical; and not a vestige of
column or capital must appear in any part of the edifice. All should be
pure, but all should be English; and there should be here, as elsewhere,
much of the utilitarian about the whole, suited to the cultivated
country in which it is placed.

248. It will never do to be speculative or imaginative in our details,
on the supposition that the tendency of fine scenery is to make
everybody imaginative and enthusiastic. Enthusiasm has no business with
Turkey carpets or easy-chairs; and the very preparation of comfort for
the body, which the existence of the villa supposes, is inconsistent
with the supposition of any excitement of mind: and this is another
reason for keeping the domestic building in richly productive country.
Nature has set aside her sublime bits for us to feel and think in; she
has pointed out her productive bits for us to sleep and eat in; and, if
we sleep and eat amongst the sublimity, we are brutal; if we poetize
amongst the cultivation, we are absurd. There are the time and place for
each state of existence, and we should not jumble that which Nature has
separated. She has addressed herself, in one part, wholly to the mind;
there is nothing for us to eat but bilberries, nothing to rest upon but
rock, and we have no business to concoct picnics, and bring cheese, and
ale, and sandwiches, in baskets, to gratify our beastly natures, where
Nature never intended us to eat (if she had, we needn't have brought the
baskets). In the other part, she has provided for our necessities; and
we are very absurd, if we make ourselves fantastic, instead of
comfortable. Therefore, all that we ought to do in the hill villa is, to
adapt it for the habitation of a man of the highest faculties of
perception and feeling; but only for the habitation of his hours of
common sense, not of enthusiasm; it must be his dwelling as a man, not
as a spirit; as a thing liable to decay, not as an eternal energy; as a
perishable, not as an immortal.

249. Keeping, then, in view these distinctions of form between the two
villas, the remaining considerations relate equally to both. We have
several times alluded to the extreme richness and variety of hill
foreground, as an internal energy to which there must be no contrast.
Rawness of color is to be especially avoided, but so, also, is poverty
of effect. It will, therefore, add much to the beauty of the building,
if in any conspicuous and harsh angle, or shadowy molding, we introduce
a wreath of carved leafwork,--in stone, of course. This sounds startling
and expensive; but we are not thinking of expense: what ought to be, not
what can be afforded, is the question. Besides, when all expense in
shamming castles, building pinnacles, and all other fantasticisms has
been shown to be injurious, that which otherwise would have been wasted
in plaster battlements, to do harm, may surely be devoted to stone
leafage, to do good. Now, if there be too much, or too conspicuous,
ornament, it will destroy simplicity and humility, and everything which
we have been endeavoring to get; therefore, the architect must be
careful, and had better have immediate recourse to that natural beauty
with which he is now endeavoring to assimilate.

250. When Nature determines on decorating a piece of projecting rock,
she begins with the bold projecting surface, to which the eye is
naturally drawn by its form, and (observe how closely she works by the
principles which were before investigated) she finishes this with
lichens and mingled colors, to a degree of delicacy, which makes us feel
that we never can look close enough; but she puts in not a single mass
of form to attract the eye, more than the grand outline renders
necessary. But, where the rock joins the ground, where the shadow falls,
and the eye is not attracted, she puts in bold forms of ornament, large
leaves and grass, bunches of moss and heather, strong in their
projection, and deep in their color. Therefore, the architect must act
on precisely the same principle: his outward surfaces he may leave the
wind and weather to finish in their own way; but he cannot allow Nature
to put grass and weeds into the shadows; _ergo_, he must do it himself;
and, whenever the eye loses itself in shade, wherever there is a dark
and sharp corner, there, if he can, he should introduce a wreath of
flower-work. The carving will be preserved from the weather by this very
propriety of situation: it would have moldered away, had it been exposed
to the full drift of the rain, but will remain safe in the crevices
where it is required; and, also, it will not injure the general effect,
but will lie concealed until we approach, and then rise up, as it were,
out of the darkness, to its duty; bestowing on the dwellings that finish
of effect which is manifested around them, and gratifying the natural
requirements of the mind for the same richness in the execution of the
designs of men, which it has found on a near approach lavished so
abundantly, in a distant view subdued so beautifully into the large
effect of the designs of Nature.

251. Of the ornament itself, it is to be observed that it is not to be
what is properly called architectural _decoration_ (that which is
"decorous," becoming, or suitable to), namely, the combination of minor
forms, which repeat the lines, and partake of the essence of the grand
design, and carry out its meaning and life into its every member; but it
is to be true sculpture; the presenting of a pure ideality of form to
the eye, which may give perfect conception, without the assistance of
color: it is to be the stone image of vegetation, not botanically
accurate, indeed, but sufficiently near to permit us to be sure of the
intended flower or leaf. Not a single line of any other kind of ornament
should be admitted, and there should be more leafage than flower-work,
as it is the more easy in its flow and outline. Deep relief need not be
attempted, but the edges of the leafage should be clearly and delicately
defined. The cabbage, the vine, and the ivy are the best and most
beautiful leaves: oak is a little too stiff, otherwise good. Particular
attention ought to be paid to the ease of the stems and tendrils; such
care will always be repaid. And it is to be especially observed, that
the carving is not to be arranged in garlands or knots, or any other
formalities, as in Gothic work; but the stalks are to rise out of the
stone, as if they were rooted in it, and to fling themselves down where
they are wanted, disappearing again in light sprays, as if they were
still growing.

252. All this will require care in designing; but, as we have said
before, we can always do without decoration; but, if we have it, it
_must_ be well done. It is not of the slightest use to economize; every
farthing improperly saved does a shilling's worth of damage; and that is
getting a bargain the wrong way. When one branch or group balances
another, they _must_ be different in composition. The same group may be
introduced several times in different parts, but not when there is
correspondence, or the effect will be unnatural; and it can hardly be
too often repeated, that the _ornament_ must be kept out of the general
effect, must be invisible to all but the near observer, and, even to
him, must not become a necessary part of the design, but must be
sparingly and cautiously applied, so as to appear to have been thrown in
by chance here and there, as Nature would have thrown in a bunch of
herbage, affording adornment without concealment, and relief without
interruption.

253. So much for form. The question of color has already been discussed
at some length, in speaking of the cottage; but it is to be noticed,
that the villa, from the nature of its situation, gets the higher hills
back into a distance which is three or four times more blue than any
piece of scenery entering into combination with the cottage; so that
more warmth of color is allowable in the building, as well as greater
cheerfulness of effect. It should not look like stone, as the cottage
should, but should tell as a building on the mind as well as the eye.
White, therefore, is frequently allowable in small quantities,
particularly on the border of a large and softly shored lake, like
Windermere and the foot of Loch Lomond; but cream-color, and
putty-color, and the other varieties of plaster-color are inexcusable.
If more warmth is required by the situation than the sun will give on
white, the building should be darkened at once. A warm rich gray is
always beautiful in any place and under any circumstance; and, in fact,
unless the proprietor likes to be kept damp like a traveling codfish, by
trees about his house and close to it (which, if it be white, he must
have, to prevent glare), such a gray is the only color which will be
beautiful, or even innocent. The difficulty is to obtain it; and this
naturally leads to the question of material.

254. If the color is to be white, we can have no ornament, for the
shadows would make it far too conspicuous, and we should get only
tawdriness. The simple forms may be executed in anything that will stand
wet; and the roof, in all cases, should be of the coarse slate of the
country, as rudely put on as possible. They must be kept clear of moss
and conspicuous vegetation, or there will be an improper appearance of
decay; but the more lichenous the better, and the rougher the slate the
sooner it is colored. If the color is to be gray, we may use the gray
primitive limestone, which is not ragged on the edges, without preparing
the blocks too smoothly; or the more compact and pale-colored slate,
which is frequently done in Westmoreland; and execute the ornaments in
any very coarse dark marble. Greenstone is an excellent rock, and has a
fine surface, but it is unmanageable. The grayer granites may often be
used with good effect, as well as the coarse porphyries, when the gray
is to be particularly warm. An outward surface of a loose block may be
often turned to good account in turning an angle; as the colors which it
has contracted by its natural exposure will remain on it without
inducing damp. It is always to be remembered, that he who prefers
neatness to beauty, and who would have sharp angles and clean surfaces,
in preference to curved outlines and lichenous color, has no business to
live among hills.

255. Such, then, are the principal points to be kept in view in the
edifice itself. Of the mode of uniting it with the near features of
foliage and ground, it would be utterly useless to speak: it is a
question of infinite variety, and involving the whole theory of
composition, so that it would take up volumes to develop principles
sufficient to guide us to the result which the feeling of the practiced
eye would arrive at in a moment. The inequalities of the ground, the
character and color of those inequalities, the nature of the air, the
exposure, and the consequent fall of the light, the quantity and form of
near and distant foliage, all have their effect on the design, and
should have their influence on the designer, inducing, as they do, a
perfect change of circumstance in every locality. Only one general rule
can be given, and that we repeat. The house must _not_ be a noun
substantive, it must not stand by itself, it must be part and parcel of
a proportioned whole: it must not even be seen all at once; and he who
sees one end should feel that, from the given data, he can arrive at no
conclusion respecting the other, yet be impressed with a feeling of a
universal energy, pervading with its beauty of unanimity all life and
all inanimation, all forms of stillness or motion, all presence of
silence or of sound.

256. Thus, then, we have reviewed the most interesting examples of
existing villa architecture, and we have applied the principles derived
from those examples to the landscape of our own country. Throughout, we
have endeavored to direct attention to the spirit, rather than to the
letter, of all law, and to exhibit the beauty of that principle which is
embodied in the line with which we have headed this concluding paper; of
being satisfied with national and natural forms, and not endeavoring to
introduce the imaginations, or imitate the customs, of foreign nations,
or of former times. All imitation has its origin in vanity, and vanity
is the bane of architecture. And, as we take leave of them, we would,
once for all, remind our English sons of Sempronius "qui villas
attollunt marmore novas," _novas_ in the full sense of the word,--and
who are setting all English feeling and all natural principles at
defiance, that it is only the _bourgeois gentilhomme_ who will wear his
dressing-gown upside down, "parceque toutes les personnes de qualité
portent les fleurs en en-bas."

PREFACE


My days and strength have lately been much broken; and I never more felt
the insufficiency of both than in preparing for the press the following
desultory memoranda on a most noble subject.  But I leave them now as
they stand, for no time nor labor would be enough to complete them to my
contentment; and I believe that they contain suggestions which may be
followed with safety, by persons who are beginning to take interest in
the aspects of mythology, which only recent investigation has removed
from the region of conjecture into that of rational inquiry.  I have
some advantage, also, from my field work, in the interpretation of myths
relating to natural phenomena; and I have had always near me, since we
were at college together, a sure, and unweariedly kind, guide, in my
friend Charles Newton, to whom we owe the finding of more treasure in
mines of marble than, were it rightly estimated, all California could
buy.  I must not, however, permit the chance of his name being in any
wise associated with my errors.  Much of my work as been done obstinately
in my own way; and he is never responsible for me, though he has often
kept me right, or at least enabled me to advance in a new direction.
Absolutely right no one can be in such matters; nor does a day pass
without convincing every honest student of antiquity of some partial
error, and showing him better how to think, and where to look.  But I
knew that there was no hope of my being able to enter with advantage on
the fields of history opened by the splendid investigation of recent
philologists, though I could qualify myself, by attention and sympathy,
to understand, here and there, a verse of Homer's or Hesiod's, as the
simple people did for whom they sang.

Even while I correct these sheets for press, a lecture by Professor
Tyndall has been put into my hands, which I ought to have heard last 16th
January, but was hindered by mischance; and which, I now find, completes,
in two important particulars, the evidence of an instinctive truth in
ancient symbolism; showing, first, that the Greek conception of an
ætherial element pervading space is justified by the closest reasoning of
modern physicists; and, secondly, that the blue of the sky, hitherto
thought to be caused by watery vapour, is, indeed, reflected from the
divided air itself; so that the bright blue of the eyes of Athena, and
the deep blue of her ægis, prove to be accurate mythic expressions of
natural phenomena which it is an uttermost triumph of recent science to
have revealed.

Indeed, it would be difficult to imagine triumph more complete.  To form,
"within an experimental tube, a bit of more perfect sky than the sky
itself!" here is magic of the finest sort! singularly reversed from that
of old time, which only asserted its competency to enclose in bottles
elemental forces that were--not of the sky.

Let me, in thanking Professor Tyndall for the true wonder of this piece
of work, ask his pardon, and that of all masters in physical science, for
any words of mine, either in the following pages or elsewhere, that may
ever seem to fail in the respect due to their great powers of thought, or
in the admiration due to the far scope of their discovery.  But I will be
judged by themselves, if I have not bitter reason to ask them to teach us
more than yet they have taught.

This first day of May, 1869, I am writing where my work was begun
thirty-five years ago, within sight of the snows of the higher Alps.  In
that half of the permitted life of man, I have seen strange evil brought
upon every scene that I best loved, or tried to make beloved by others.
The light which once flushed those pale summits with its rose at dawn,
and purple at sunset, is now umbered and faint; the air which once inlaid
the clefts of all their golden crags with azure is now defiled with
languid coils of smoke, belched from worse than volcanic fires; their
very glacier waves are ebbing, and their snows fading, as if hell had
breathed on them; the waters that once sank at their feet into
crystalline rest are now dimmed and foul, from deep to deep, and shore to
shore.  These are no careless words--they are accurately, horribly, true.
I know what the Swiss lakes were; no pool of Alpine fountain at its
source was clearer.  This morning, on the Lake of Geneva, at half a mile
from the beach, I could scarcely see my oar-blade a fathom deep.

The light, the air, the waters, all defiled!  How of the earth itself?
Take this one fact for type of honour done by the modern Swiss to the
earth of his native land.  There used to be a little rock at the end of
the avenue by the port of Neuchâtel; there, the last marble of the foot
of Jura, sloping to the blue water, and (at this time of year) covered
with bright pink tufts of Saponaria.  I went, three days since, to gather
a blossom at the place.  The goodly native rock and its flowers were
covered with the dust and refuse of the town; but, in the middle of the
avenue, was a newly-constructed artificial rockery, with a fountain
twisted through a spinning spout, and an inscription on one of its
loose-tumbled stones,--

      "Aux Botanistes,
      Le club Jurassique,"

Ah, masters of modern science, give me back my Athena out of your vials,
and seal, if it may be, once more, Asmodeus therein.  You have divided
the elements, and united them; enslaved them upon the earth, and
discerned them in the stars.  Teach us now, but this of them, which is
all that man need know,--that the Air is given to him for his life; and
the Rain to his thirst, and for his baptism; and the Fire for warmth; and
the Sun for sight; and the Earth for his Meat--and his Rest.

LECTURE ON THE GREEK MYTHS OF STORM, GIVEN (PARTLY) IN UNIVERSITY
      COLLEGE, LONDON, MARCH 9, 1869.


1. I will not ask your pardon for endeavoring to interest you in the
subject of Greek Mythology; but I must ask your permission to approach
it in a temper differing from that in which it is frequently treated.
We cannot justly interpret the religion of any people, unless we are
prepared to admit that we ourselves, as well as they, are liable to
error in matters of faith; and that the convictions of others, however
singular, may in some points have been well founded, while our own,
however reasonable, may be in some particulars mistaken.  You must
forgive me, therefore, for not always distinctively calling the creeds
of the past "superstition," and the creeds of the present day "religion;"
as well as for assuming that a faith now confessed may sometimes be
superficial, and that a faith long forgotten may once have been sincere.
It is the task of the Divine to condemn the errors of antiquity, and of
the philologists to account for them; I will only pray you to read, with
patience, and human sympathy, the thoughts of men who lived without blame
in a darkness they could not dispel; and to remember that, whatever
charge of folly may justly attach to the saying, "There is no God," the
folly is prouder, deeper, and less pardonable, in saying, "There is no
God but for me."

2. A myth, in its simplest definition, is a story with a meaning attached
to it other than it seems to have at first; and the fact that it has such
a meaning is generally marked by some of its circumstances being
extraordinary, or, in the common use of the word, unnatural.  Thus if I
tell you that Hercules killed a water-serpent in the lake of Lerna, and
if I mean, and you understand, nothing more than that fact, the story,
whether true or false, is not a myth.  But if by telling you this, I mean
that Hercules purified the stagnation of many streams from deadly
miasmata, my story, however simple, is a true myth; only, as, if I leftit
in that simplicity, you would probably look for nothing beyond, it will
be wise in me to surprise your attention by adding some singular
circumstance; for instance, that the water-snake had several heads, which
revived as fast as they were killed, and which poisoned even the foot
that trod upon them as they slept.  And in proportion to the fulness of
intended meaning I shall probably multiply and refine upon these
improbabilities; as, suppose, if, instead of desiring only to tell you
that Hercules purified a marsh, I wished you to understand that he
contended with the venom and vapor of envy and evil ambition, whether in
other men's souls or in his own, and choked that malaria only by supreme
toil,--I might tell you that this serpent was formed by the goddess whose
pride was in the trial of Hercules; and that its place of abode as by a
palm-tree; and that for every head of it that was cut off, two rose up
with renewed life; and that the hero found at last that he could not kill
the creature at all by cutting its heads off or crushing them, but only
by burning them down; and that the midmost of them could not be killed
even that way, but had to be buried alive.  Only in proportion as I mean
more,  I shall certainly appear more absurd in my statement; and at last
when I get unendurably significant, all practical persons will agree that
I was talking mere nonsense from the beginning, and never meant anything
at all.

3.  It is just possible, however, also, that the story-teller may all
along have meant nothing but what he said; and that, incredible as the
events may appear, he himself literally believed--and expected you also
to believe--all this about Hercules, without any latent moral or history
whatever.  And it is very necessary, in reading traditions of this kind,
to determine, first of all, whether you are listening to a simple person,
who is relating what, at all events, he believes to be true, (and may,
therefore, possibly have been so to some extent), or to a reserved
philosopher, who is veiling a theory of the universe under the grotesque
of a fairy tale.  It is, in general, more likely that the first
supposition should be the right one: simple and credulous persons are,
perhaps fortunately, more common than philosophers; and it is of the
highest importance that you should take their innocent testimony as it
was meant, and not efface, under the graceful explanation which your
cultivated ingenuity may suggest, either the evidence their story may
contain (such as it is worth) of an extraordinary event having really
taken place, or the unquestionable light which it will cast upon the
character of the person by whom it was frankly believed.  And to deal
with Greek religion honestly, you must at once understand that this
literal belief was, in the mind of the general people, as deeply rooted
as ours in the legends of our own sacred book; and that a basis of
unmiraculous event was as little suspected, and an explanatory symbolism
as rarely traced, by them, as by us.

You must, therefore, observe that I deeply degrade the position which
such a myth as that just referred to occupied in the Greek mind, by
comparing it (for fear of offending you) to our story of St. George and
the Dragon.  Still, the analogy is perfect in minor respects; and though
it fails to give you any notion of the Greek faith, it will exactly
illustrate the manner in which faith laid hold of its objects.

4.  This story of Hercules and the Hydra, then, was to the general Greek
mind, in its best days, a tale about a real hero and a real monster.  Not
one in a thousand knew anything of the way in which the story had arisen,
any more than the English peasant generally is aware of the plebeian
original of St. George; or supposes that there were once alive in the
world, with sharp teeth and claws, real, and very ugly, flying dragons.
On the other hand, few persons traced any moral or symbolical meaning in
the story, and the average Greek was as far from imagining any
interpretation like that I have just given you, as an average Englishman
is from seeing is St. George the Red Cross Knight of Spenser, or in the
Dragon the Spirit of Infidelity.  But, for all that, there was a certain
undercurrent of consciousness in all minds that the figures meant more
than they at first showed; and, according to each man's own faculties of
sentiment, he judged and read them; just as a Knight of the Garter reads
more in the jewel on his collar than the George and Dragon of a
public-house expresses to the host or to his customers.  Thus, to the
mean person the myth always meant little; to the noble person, much; and
the greater their familiarity with it, the more contemptible it became to
one, and the more sacred to the other; until vulgar commentators
explained it entirely away, while Virgil made the crowning glory of his
choral hymn to Hercules.

      "Around thee, powerless to infect thy soul,
      Rose, in his crested crowd, the Lerna worm."

                          "Non te rationis egentem
      Lernæus turbâ capitum circumstetit anguis."

And although, in any special toil of the hero's life, the moral
interpretation was rarely with definiteness attached to the event, yet
in the whole course of the life, not only for a symbolical meaning, but
the warrant for the existence of a real spiritual power, was apprehended
of all men.  Hercules was no dead hero, to be remembered only as a victor
over monsters of the past--harmless now as slain.  He was the perpetual
type and mirror of heroism, and its present and living aid against every
ravenous form of human trial and pain.

5.  But, if we seek to know more than this and to ascertain the manner in
which the story first crystallized into its shape, we shall find
ourselves led back generally to one or other of two sources--either to
actual historical events, represented by the fancy under figures
personifying them; or else to natural phenomena similarly endowed with
life by the imaginative power usually more or less under the influence of
terror.  The historical myths we must leave the masters of history to
follow; they, and the events they record, being yet involved in great,
though attractive and penetrable, mystery.  But the stars, and hills, and
storms are with us now, as they were with others of old; and it only
needs that we look at them with the earnestness of those childish eyes to
understand the first words spoken of them by the children of men, and
then, in all the most beautiful and enduring myths, we shall find, not
only a literal story of a real person, not only a parallel imagery of
moral principle, but an underlying worship of natural phenomena, out of
which both have sprung, and in which both forever remain rooted.  Thus,
from the real sun, rising and setting,--from the real atmosphere, calm in
its dominion of unfading blue, and fierce in its descent of tempest,--the
Greek forms first the idea of two entirely personal and corporal gods,
whose limbs are clothes in divine flesh, and whose brows are crowned with
divine beauty; yet so real that the quiver rattles at their shoulder, and
the chariot bends beneath their weight.  And, on the other hand,
collaterally with these corporeal images, and never for one instant
separated from them, he conceives also two omnipresent spiritual
influences, as the sun, with a constant fire, whatever in humanity is
skilful and wise; and the other, like the living air, breathes the calm
of heavenly fortitude, and strength of righteous anger, into every human
breast that is pure and brave.

6.  Now, therefore, in nearly every myth of importance, and certainly in
every one of those which I shall speak to-night, you have to discern
these three structural parts,--the root and the two branches: the root,
in physical existence, sun, or sky, or cloud, or sea; then the personal
incarnation of that, becoming a trusted and companionable deity, with
whom you may walk hand in hand, as a child with its brother or its
sister; and, lastly, the moral significance of the image, which is in all
the great myths eternally and beneficently true.

7.  The great myths; that is to say, myths made by great people.  For the
first plain fact about myth-making is one which has been most strangely
lost sight of,--that you cannot make a myth unless you have something to
make it of.  You cannot tell a secret which you don't know.  If the myth
is about the sky, it must have been made by somebody who has looked at
the sky.  If the myth is about justice and fortitude, it must have been
made by someone who knew what it was to be just or patient.  According to
the quantity of understanding in the person will be the quantity of
significance in his fable; and the myth of a simple and ignorant race
must necessarily mean little, because a simple and ignorant race have
little to mean.  So the great question in reading a story is always, not
what wild hunter dreamed, or what childish race first dreaded it; but
what wise man first perfectly told, and what strong people first
perfectly lived by it.  And the real meaning of any myth is that which it
has at the noblest age of the nation among whom it is current.  The
farther back you pierce, the less significance you will find, until you
come to the first narrow thought, which, indeed, contains the germ of the
accomplished tradition; but only as the seed contains the flower.  As the
intelligence and passion of the race develop, they cling to and nourish
their beloved and sacred legend; leaf by leaf it expands under the touch
of more pure affections, and more delicate imagination, until at last the
perfect fable burgeons out into symmetry of milky stem and honied bell.

8.  But through whatever changes it may pass, remember that our right
reading of it is wholly dependent on the materials we have in our own
minds for an intelligent answering sympathy.  If it first arose among a
people who dwelt under stainless skies, and measures their journeys by
ascending and declining stars, we certainly cannot read their story, if
we have never seen anything above us in the day but smoke, nor anything
around us in the night but candles.  If the tale goes on to change clouds
or planets into living creatures,--to invest them with fair forms and
inflame them with mighty passions,--we can only understand the story of
the human-hearted things, in so far as we ourselves take pleasure in the
perfectness of visible form, or can sympathize, by an effort of
imagination, with the strange people who had other loves than those of
wealth, and other interests than those of commerce.  And, lastly, if the
myth complete itself to the fulfilled thoughts of the nation, by
attributing to the gods, whom they have carved out of their fantasy,
continual presence with their own souls; and their every effort for good
is finally guided by the sense of the companionship, the praise, and the
pure will of immortals, we shall be able to follow them into this last
circle of their faith only in the degree in which the better parts of our
own beings have been also stirred by the aspects of nature, or
strengthened by her laws.  It may be easy to prove that the ascent of
Apollo in his chariot signifies nothing but the rising of the sun.  But
what does the sunrise itself signify to us?  If only languid return to
frivolous amusement, or fruitless labor, it will, indeed, not be easy for
us to conceive the power, over a Greek, of the name of Apollo.  But if,
fir us also, as for the Greek, the sunrise means daily restoration to the
sense of passionate gladness and of perfect life--if it means the
thrilling of new strength through every nerve,--the shedding over us of a
better peace than the peace of night, in the power of the dawn,--and the
purging of evil vision and fear by the baptism of its dew;--if the sun
itself is an influence, to us also, of spiritual good--and becomes thus
in reality, not in imagination, to us also, a spiritual power,--we may
then soon over-pass the narrow limit of conception which kept that power
impersonal, and rise with the Greek to the thought of an angel who
rejoiced as a strong man to run his course, whose voice calling to life
and to labor rang round the earth, and whose going forth was to the ends
of heaven.

9.  The time, then, at which I shall take up for you, as well as I can
decipher it, the traditions of the gods of Greece, shall be near the
beginning of its central and formed faith,--about 500 B.C.,--a faith of
which the character is perfectly represented by Pindar and Æschylus, who
are both of them outspokenly religious, and entirely sincere men; while
we may always look back to find the less developed thought of the
preceding epoch given by Homer, in a more occult, subtle,
half-instinctive, and involuntary way.

10.  Now, at that culminating period of the Greek religion, we find,
under one governing Lord of all things, four subordinate elemental
forces, and four spiritual powers living in them and commanding them.
The elements are of course the well-known four of the ancient world,--
the earth, the waters, the fire, and the air; and the living powers of
them are Demeter, the Latin Ceres; Poseidon, the Latin Neptune; Apollo,
who has retained always his Greek name; and Athena, the Latin Minerva.
Each of these are descended from, or changed from, more ancient, and
therefore more mystic, deities of the earth and heaven, and of a finer
element of æther supposed to be beyond the heavens;* but at this time
we find the four quite definite, both in their kingdoms and in their
personalities.  They are the rulers of the earth that we tread upon, and
the air that we breathe; and are with us closely, in their vivid
humanity, as the dust that they animate, and the winds that they bridle.
I shall briefly define for you the range of their separate dominions, and
then follow, as far as we have time, the most interesting of the legends
which relate to the queen of the air.


* And by modern science now also asserted, and with probability argued,
to exist.


11.  The rule of the first spirit, Demeter, the earth mother, is over the
earth, first, as the origin of all life,--the dust from whence we were
taken; secondly, as the receiver of all things back at last into silence
--"Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."  And, therefore, as
the most tender image of this appearing and fading life, in the birth and
fall of flowers, her daughter Proserpine plays in the fields of Sicily,
and thence is torn away into darkness, and becomes the Queen of Fate--not
merely of death, but of the gloom which closes over and ends, not beauty
only, but sin, and chiefly of sins the sin against the life she gave; so
that she is, in her highest power, Persephone, the avenger and purifier
of blood--"The voice of thy brother's blood cries to me out of the
ground."  Then, side by side with this queen of the earth, we find a
demigod of agriculture by the plough--the lord of grain, or of the thing
ground by the mill.  And it is a singular proof of the simplicity of
Greek character at this noble time, that of all representations left to
us of their deities by their art, few are so frequent, and none perhaps
so beautiful, as the symbol of this spirit of agriculture.

12.  Then the dominant spirit of the element water is Neptune, but
subordinate to him are myriads of other water spirits, of whom Nereus is
the chief, with Palæmon, and Leucothea, the "white lady" of the sea; and
Thetis, and nymphs innumerable who, like her, could "suffer a sea
change," while the river deities had each independent power, according
to the preciousness of their streams to the cities fed by them,--the
"fountain Arethuse, and thou, honoured flood, smooth sliding Mincius,
crowned with vocal reeds."  And, spiritually, this king of the waters is
lord of the strength and daily flow of human life--he gives it material
force and victory; which as the meaning of the dedication of the hair, as
the sign of the strength of life, to the river or the native land.

13.  Demeter, then, over the earth, and its giving and receiving of life.
Neptune over the waters, and the flow and force of life,--always among
the Greeks typified by the horse, which was to them as a crested
sea-wave, animated and bridled.  Then the third element, fire, has set
over it two powers: over earthly fire, the assistant of human labor, is
set Hephæstus, lord of all labor in which is the flush and the sweat of
the brow; and over heavenly fire, the source of day, is set Apollo, the
spirit of all kindling, purifying, and illuminating intellectual wisdom,
each of these gods having also their subordinate or associated powers,--
servant, or sister, or companion muse.

14.  Then, lastly, we come to the myth which is to be our subject of
closer inquiry,--the story of Athena and of the deities subordinate to
her.  This great goddess, the Neith of the Egyptians, the Athena or
Athenaia of the Greeks, and, with broken power, half usurped by Mars,
the Minerva of the Latins, is, physically, the queen of the air; having
supreme power both over its blessing of calm, and wrath of storm; and,
spiritually, she is the queen of the breath of man, first of the bodily
breathing which is life to his blood, and strength to his arm in battle;
and then of the mental breathing, or inspiration, which is his moral
health and habitual wisdom; wisdom of conduct and of the heart, as
opposed to the wisdom of imagination and the brain; moral, as distinct
from intellectual; inspired, as distinct from illuminated.

15.  By a singular and fortunate, though I believe wholly accidental,
coincidence, the heart-virtue, of which she is the spirit, was separated
by the ancients into four divisions, which have since obtained acceptance
from all men as rightly discerned, and have received, as if from the
quarters of the four winds of which Athena is the natural queen, the name
of "Cardinal" virtues: namely, Prudence (the right seeing, and
foreseeing, of events through darkness); Justice (the righteous bestowal
of favor and of indignation); Fortitude (patience under trial by pain);
and Temperance (patience under trial by pleasure).  With respect to these
four virtues, the attributes of Athena are all distinct.  In her
prudence, or sight in darkness, she is "Glaukopis," "owl-eyed."*  In her
justice, which is the dominant virtue, she wears two robes, one of light,
and one of darkness; the robe of light, saffron color, or the color of
the daybreak, falls to her feet, covering her wholly with favor and
love,--the calm of the sky in blessing; it is embroidered along its edge
with her victory over the giants (the troublous powers of the earth), and
the likeness of it was woven yearly by the Athenian maidens and carried
to the temple of their own Athena, not to the Parthenon, that was the
temple of all the world's Athena,--but this they carried to the temple of
their own only one who loved them, and stayed with them always.  Then her
robe of indignation is worn on her breast and left arm only, fringed with
fatal serpents, and fastened with Gorgonian cold, turning men to stone;
physically, the lightning and hail of chastisement by storm.  Then in her
fortitude she wears the crested and unstooping hemlet;** and lastly, in
her temperance, she is the queen of maidenhood--stainless as the air of
heaven.


* There are many other meanings in the epithet; see farther on, §91, pp.
133, 134.
** I am compelled, for clearness' sake, to mark only one meaning at a
time.  Athena's helmet is sometimes a mask, sometimes a sign of anger,
sometimes of the highest light of æther; but I cannot speak of all this
at once.


16.  But all these virtues mass themselves in the Greek mind into the two
main ones,--of Justice, or noble passion, and Fortitude, or noble
patience; and of these, the chief powers of Athena, the Greeks have
divinely written for them, and for all men after them, two mighty songs,
--one, of the Menis,* Mens, passion, or zeal, of Athena, breathed into a
mortal whose name is "Ache of heart," and whose short life is only the
incarnate brooding and burst of storm; and the other is of the foresight
and fortitude of Athena, maintained by her in the heart of a mortal whose
name is given to him from a longer grief, Odysseus, the full of sorrow,
the much enduring, and the long-suffering.


* This first word of the Iliad, Menis, afterwards passes into the Latin
Mens; is the root of the Latin name for Athena, "Minerva," and so the
root of the English "mind."


17.  The minor expressions by the Greeks in word, in symbol, and in
religious service, of this faith, are so many and so beautiful, that I
hope some day to gather at least a few of them into a separate body of
evidence respecting the power of Athena, and of its relations to the
ethical conception of the Homeric poems, or, rather, to their ethical
nature; for they are not conceived didactically, but are didactic in
their essence, as all good art is.  There is an increasing insensibility
to this character, and even an open denial of it, among us now which is
one of the most curious errors of modernism,--the peculiar and judicial
blindness of an age which, having long practised art and poetry for the
sake of pleasure only, has become incapable of reading their language
when they were both didactic; and also, having been itself accustomed to
a professedly didactic teaching, which yet, for private interests,
studiously avoids collision with every prevalent vice of its day (and
especially with avarice), has become equally dead to the intensely
ethical conceptions of a race which habitually divided all men into two
broad classes of worthy or worthless,--good, and good for nothing.  And
even the celebrated passage of Horace about the Iliad is now misread or
disbelieved, as if it were impossible that the Iliad could be instructive
because it is not like a sermon.  Horce does not say that it is like a
sermon, and would have been still less likely to say so if he ever had
had the advantage of hearing a sermon.  "I have been reading that story
of Troy again" (thus he writes to a noble youth of Rome whom he cared
for), "quietly at Præneste, while you have been busy at Rome; and truly
I think that what is base and what is noble, and what useful and useless,
may be better learned from that, than from all Chrysippus' and Crantor's
talk put together."*  Which is profoundly true, not of the Iliad only,
but of all other great art whatsoever; for all pieces of such art are
didactic in the purest way, indirectly and occultly, so that, first, you
shall only be bettered by them if you are already hard at work in
bettering yourself; and when you are bettered by them, it shall be partly
with a general acceptance of their influence, so constant and subtile
that you shall be no more conscious of it than of the healthy digestion
of food; and partly by a gift of unexpected truth, which you shall only
find by slow mining for it,--which is withheld on purpose, and
close-locked, that you may not get it till you have forged the key of it
in a furnace of your own heating.  And this withholding of their meaning
is continual, and confessed, in the great poets.  Thus Pindar says of
himself: "There is many an arrow in my quiver, full of speech to the
wise, but, for the many, they need interpreters."  And neither Pindar,
nor Æschylus, nor Hesiod, nor Homer, nor any of the greater poets or
teachers of any nation or time, ever spoke but with intentional
reservation; nay, beyond this, there is often a meaning which they
themselves cannot interpert [sic],--which it may be for ages long after
them to intrepert [sic],--in what they said, so far as it recorded true
imaginative vision.  For all the greatest myths have been seen by the men
who tell them, involuntarily and passively,--seen by them with as great
distinctness (and in some respects, though not in all, under conditions
as far beyond the control of their will) as a dream sent to any of us by
night when we dream clearest; and it is this veracity of vision that
could not be refused, and of moral that could not be foreseen, which in
modern historical inquiry has been left wholly out of account; being
indeed the thing which no merely historical investigator can understand,
or even believe; for it belongs exclusively to the creative or artistic
group of men, and can only be interpreted by those of their race, who
themselves in some measure also see visions and dream dreams.


* Note, once for all, that unless when there is question about some
particular expression, I never translate literally, but give the real
force of what is said, as I best can, freely.


So that you may obtain a more truthful idea of the nature of Greek
religion and legend from the poems of Keats, and the nearly as beautiful,
and, in general grasp of subject, far more powerful, recent work of
Morris, than from frigid scholarship, however extensive.  Not that the
poet's impressions or renderings of things are wholly true, but their
truth is vital, not formal.  They are like sketches from the life by
Reynolds or Gainsborough, which may be demonstrably inaccurate or
imaginary in many traits, and indistinct in others, yet will be in the
deepest sense like, and true; while the work of historical analysis is
too often weak with loss, through the very labor of its miniature
touches, or useless in clumsy and vapid veracity of externals, and
complacent security of having done all that is required for the portrait,
when it has measured the breadth of the forehead and the length of the
nose.

18.  The first of requirements, then, for the right reading of myths, is
the understanding of the nature of all true vision by noble persons;
namely, that it is founded on constant laws common to all human nature;
that it perceives, however darkly, things which are for all ages true;
that we can only understand it so far as we have some perception of the
same truth; and that its fulness is developed and manifested more and
more by the reverberation of it from minds of the same mirror-temper, in
succeeding ages.  You will understand Homer better by seeing his
reflection in Dante, as you may trace new forms and softer colors in a
hillside, redoubled by a lake.

I shall be able partly to show you, even to-night, how much, in the
Homeric vision of Athena, has been made clearer by the advance of time,
being thus essentially and eternally true; but I must in the outset
indicate the relation to that central thought of the imagery of the
inferior deities of storm.

19.  And first I will take the myth of Æolus (the "sage Hippotades" of
Milton), as it is delivered pure by Homer from the early times.

Why do you suppose Milton calls him "sage"?  One does not usually think
of the winds as very thoughtful or deliberate powers.  But hear Homer:
"Then we came to the Æolian island, and there dwelt Æolus Hippotades,
dear to the deathless gods; there he dwelt in a floating island, and
round it was a wall of brass that could not be broken; and the smooth
rock of it ran up sheer.  To whom twelve children were born in the sacred
chambers,--six daughters and six strong sons; and they dwell foreer with
their beloved father and their mother, strict in duty; and with them are
laid up a thousand benefits; and the misty house around them rings with
fluting all the day long."  Now, you are to note first, in this
description, the wall of brass and the sheer rock.  You will find,
throughout the fables of the tempest-group, that the brazen wall and the
precipice (occurring in another myth as the brazen tower of Danaë) are
always connected with the idea of the towering cloud lighted by the sun,
here truly described as a floating island.  Secondly, you hear that all
treasures were laid up in them; therefore, you know this Æolus is lord of
the beneficent winds ("he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries"); and
presently afterwards Homer calls him the "steward" of the winds, the
master of the store-house of them.  And this idea of gifts and
preciousness in the winds of heaven is carried out in the well-known
sequel of the fable: Æolus gives them to Ulysses, all but one, bound in
leathern bags, with a glittering cord of silver; and so like bags of
treasure that the sailors think they are so, and open them to see.  And
when Ulysses is thus driven back to Æolus, and prays him again to help
him, note the deliberate words of the king's refusal,--"Did I not," says
he, "send thee on thy way heartily, that thou mightest reach thy country,
thy home, and whatever is dear to thee?  It is not lawful for me again
to send forth favorably on his journey a man hated by the happy gods."
This idea of the beneficence of Æolus remains to the latest times, though
Virgil, by adopting the vulgar change of the cloud island into Lipari,
has lost it a little; but even when it is finally explained away by
Diodorus, Æolus is still a kind-hearted monarch, who lived on the coast
of Sorrento, invented the use of sails, and established a system of storm
signals.

20.  Another beneficent storm-power, Boreas, occupies an important place
in early legend, and a singularly principal one in art; and I wish I
could read to you a passage of Plato about the legend of Boreas and
Oreithyia,* and the breeze and shade of the Ilissus--notwithstannding its
severe reflection upon persons who waste their time on mythological
studies; but I must go on at once to the fable with which you are all
generally familiar, that of the Harpies.


* Translated by Max Müller in the opening of his essay on "Comparative
Mythology."--Chips from a German Workshop, vol. ii.


This is always connected with that of Boreas or the north wind, because
the two sons of Boreas are enemies of the Harpies, and drive them away
into frantic flight.  The myth in its first literal form means only the
battle between the fair north wind and the foul south one: the two
Harpies, "Stormswift" and "Swiftfoot," are the sisters of the rainbow;
that is to say, they are the broken drifts of the showery south wind, and
the clear north wind drives them back; but they quickly take a deeper and
more malignant significance.  You know the short, violent, spiral gusts
that lift the dust before coming rain: the Harpies get identified first
with these, and then with more violent whirlwinds, and so they are called
"Harpies," "the Snatchers," and are thought of as entirely destructive;
their manner of destroying being twofold,--by snatching away, and by
defiling and polluting.  This is a month in which you may really see a
small Harpy at her work almost whenever you choose.  The first time that
there is threatening of rain after two or three days of fine weather,
leave your window well open to the street, and some books or papers on
the table; and if you do not, in a little while, know what the Harpies
mean, and how they snatch, and how they defile, I'll give up my Greek
myths.

21.  That is the physical meaning.  It is now easy to find the mental
one.  You must all have felt the expression of ignoble anger in those
fitful gusts of storm.  There is a sense of provocation in their thin
and senseless fury, wholly different from the nobler anger of the greater
tempests.  Also, they seem useless and unnatural, and the Greek thinks of
them always as vile in malice, and opposed, therefore, to the Sons of
Boreas, who are kindly winds, that fill sails, and wave harvests,--full
of bracing health and happy impulses.  From this lower and merely greater
terror, always associated with their whirling motion, which is indeed
indicative of the most destructive winds; and they are thus related to
the nobler tempests, as Charybdis to the sea; they are devouring and
desolating, making all things disappear that come in their grasp; and so,
spiritually, they are the gusts of vexatious, fretful, lawless passion,
vain and overshadowing, discontented and lamenting, meager and insane,--
spirits of wasted energy, and wandering disease, and unappeased famine,
and unsatisfied hope.  So you have, on the one side, the winds of
prosperity and health, on the other, of ruin and sickness.  Understand
that, once, deeply,--any who have ever known the weariness of vain
desires, the pitiful, unconquerable, coiling and recoiling famine and
thirst of heart,--and you will know what was in the sound of the Harpy
Celæno's shriek from her rock; and why, in the seventh circle of the
"Inferno," the Harpies make their nests in the warped branches of the
trees that are the souls of suicides.

22.  Now you must always be prepared to read Greek legends as you trace
threads through figures on a silken damask: the same thread runs through
the web, but it makes part of different figures.  Joined with other
colors you hardly recognize it, and in different lights it is dark or
light.  Thus the Greek fables blend and cross curiously in different
directions, till they knit themselves into an arabesque where sometimes
you cannot tell black from purple, nor blue from emerald--they being all
the truer for this, because the truths of emotion they represent are
interwoven in the same way, but all the more difficult to read, and to
explain in any order.  Thus the Harpies, as they represent vain desire,
are connected with the Sirens, who are the spirits of constant desire; so
that it is difficult sometimes in early art to know which are meant, both
being represented alike as birds with women's heads; only the Sirens are
the great constant desires--the infinite sicknesses of heart--which,
rightly placed, give life, and wrongly placed, waste it away; so that
there are two groups of Sirens, one noble and saving, as the other is
fatal.  But there are no animating or saving Harpies; their nature is
always vexing and full of weariness, and thus they are curiously
connected with the whole group of legends about Tantalus.

33.*  We all know what it is to be tantalized; but we do not often think
of asking what Tantalus was tantalized for--what he had done, to be
forever kept hungry in sight of food.  Well; he had not been condemned to
this merely for being a glutton.  By Dante the same punishment is
assigned to simple gluttony, to purge it away; but the sins of Tantalus
were of a much wider and more mysterious kind.  There are four great sins
attributed to him: one, stealing the food of the gods to give it to men;
another, sacrificing his son to feed the gods themselves (it may remind
you for a moment of what I was telling you of the earthly character of
Demeter, that, while the other gods all refuse, she, dreaming about her
lost daughter, eats part of the shoulder of Pelops before she knows what
she is doing); another sin is, telling the secrets of the gods; and only
the fourth--stealing the golden dog of Pandareos--is connected with
gluttony.  The special sense of this myth is marked by Pandareos
receiving the happy privilege of never being troubled with indigestion;
the dog, in general, however mythically represents all utter senseless
and carnal desires; mainly that of gluttony; and in the mythic sense of
Hades--that is to say, so far as it represents spiritual ruin in this
life, and not a literal hell--the dog Cerberus as its gatekeeper--with
this special marking of his character of sensual passion, that he fawns
on all those who descend, but rages against all who would return (the
Virgilian "facilis descendus" being a later recognition of this mythic
character of Hades); the last labor of Hercules is the dragging him up
to the light; and in some sort he represents the voracity or devouring
of Hades itself; and the mediæval representation of the mouth of hell
perpetuates the same thought.  Then, also, the power of evil passion
is partly associated with the red and scorching light of Sirius, as
opposed to the pure light of the sun: he is the dog-star of ruin; and
hence the continual Homeric dwelling upon him, and comparison of the
flame of anger to his swarthy light; only, in his scorching, it is
thirst, not hunger, over which he rules physically; so that the fable
of Icarius, his first master, corresponds, among the Greeks, to the
legend of the drunkenness of Noah.


* Printer's error: should be 23.


The story of Actæon, the raging death of Hecuba, and the tradition of
the white dog which ate part of Hercules' first sacrifice, and so gave
name to the Cynosarges, are all various phases of the same thought,--the
Greek notion of the dog being throughout confused between its serviceable
fidelity, its watchfulness, its foul voracity, shamelessness, and deadly
madness, while with the curious reversal or recoil of the meaning which
attaches itself to nearly every great myth,--and which we shall presently
see notably exemplified in the relations of the serpent to Athena,--the
dog becomes in philosophy a type of severity and abstinence.

24.  It would carry us too far aside were I to tell you the story of
Pandareos' dog--or rather of Jupiter's dog, for Pandareos was its
guardian only; all that bears on our present purpose is that the guardian
of this golden dog had three daughters, one of whom was subject to the
power of the Sirens, and is turned into a nightingale; and the other two
were subject to the power of the Harpies, and this was what happened to
them: They were very beautiful, and they were beloved by the gods in
their youth, and all the great goddesses were anxious to bring them up
rightly.  Of all types of young ladies' education, there is nothing so
splendid as that of the younger daughters of Pandareos.  They have
literally the four greatest goddesses for their governesses.  Athena
teaches them domestic accomplishments, how to weave, and sew, and the
like; Artemis teaches them to hold themselves up straight; Hera, how to
behave proudly and oppressively to company; and Aphrodite, delightful
governess, feeds them with cakes and honey all day long.  All goes well,
until just the time when they are going to be brought out; then there is
a great dispute whom they are to marry, and in the midst of it they are
carried off by the Harpies, given by them to be slaves to the Furies, and
never seen more.  But of course there is nothing in Greek myths; and one
never heard of such things as vain desires, and empty hopes, and clouded
passions, defiling and snatching away the souls of maidens, in a London
season.

I have no time to trace for you any more harpy legends, though they are
full of the most curious interest; but I may confirm for you my
interpretation of this one, and prove its importance in the Greek mind,
by noting that Polygnotus painted these maidens, in his great religious
series of paintings at Delphi, crowned with flowers, and playing at dice;
and that Penelope remembers them in her last fit of despair, just before
the return of Ulysses, and prays bitterly that she may be snatched away
at once into nothingness by the Harpies, like Pandareos' daughters,
rather than be tormented longer by her deferred hope, and anguish of
disappointed love.

25.  I have hitherto spoken only of deities of the winds.  We pass now to
a far more important group, the deities of cloud.  Both of these are
subordinate to the ruling power of the air, as the demigods of the
fountains and minor seas are to the great deep; but, as the
cloud-firmament detaches itself more from the air, and has a wider range
of ministry than the minor streams and seas, the highest cloud deity,
Hermes, has a rank more equal with Athena than Nereus or Proteus with
Neptune; and there is greater difficulty in tracing his character,
because his physical dominion over the clouds can, of course, be asserted
only where clouds are; and, therefore, scarcely at all in Egypt;* so that
the changes which Hermes undergoes in becoming a Greek from an Egyptian
and Phnician god, are greater than in any other case of adopted
tradition  In Egypt Hermes is a deity of historical record, and a
conductor of the dead to judgment; the Greeks take away much of this
historical function, assigning it to the Muses; but, in investing him
with the physical power over clouds, they give him that which the Muses
disdain,--the power of concealment and of theft.  The snatching away by
the Harpies is with brute force; but the snatching away by the clouds
is connected with the thought of hiding, and of making things seem to
be what they are not; so that Hermes is the god of lying, as he is of
mist; and yet with this ignoble function of making things vanish and
disappear is connected the remnant of his grand Egyptian authority of
leading away souls in the cloud of death (the actual dimness of sight
caused by mortal wounds physically suggesting the darkness and descent
of clouds, and continually being so described in the Iliad); while the
sense of the need of guidance on the untrodden road follows necessarily.
You cannot but remember how this thought of cloud guidance, and cloud
receiving souls at death, has been elsewhere ratified.


* I believe that the conclusions of recent scholarship are generally
opposed to the Herodotean ideas of any direct acceptance by the Greeks
of Egyptian myths: and very certainly, Greek art is developed by giving
the veracity and simplicity of real life to Eastern savage grotesque; and
not by softening the severity of pure Egyptian design.  But it is of no
consequence whether one conception was, or was not, in this case, derived
from the other; my object is only to mark the essential difference
between them.


26.  Without following that higher clue, I will pass to the lovely group
of myths connected with the birth of Hermes on the Greek mountains.  You
know that the valley of Sparta is one of the noblest mountain ravines in
the world, and that the western flank of it is formed by an unbroken
chain of crags, forty miles long, rising, opposite Sparta, to a height of
8,000 feet, and known as the chain of Taygetus.  Now, the nymph from whom
that mountain ridge is named was the mother of Lacedæmon; therefore the
mythic ancestress of the Spartan race.  She is the nymph Taygeta, and one
of the seven stars of spring; one of those Pleiades of whom is the
question to Job,--"Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or
loose the bands of Orion?"  "The sweet influences of Pleiades," of the
stars of spring,--nowhere sweeter than among the pine-clad slopes of the
hills of Sparta and Arcadia, when he snows of their higher summits,
beneath the sunshine of April, fell into fountains, and rose into clouds;
and in every ravine was a newly awakened voice of waters,--soft increase
of whisper among its sacred stones; and on every crag its forming and
fading veil of radiant cloud; temple above temple, of the divine marble
that no tool can pollute, nor ruin undermine.  And, therefore, beyond
this central valley, this great Greek vase of Arcadia, on the "hollow"
mountain, Cyllene, or "pregnant" mountain, called also "cold," because
there the vapors rest,* and born of the eldest of those stars of spring,
that Maia, from whom your own month of May has its name, bringing to you,
in the green of her garlands, and the white of her hawthorn, the
unrecognized symbols of the pastures and the wreathed snows of Arcadia,
where long ago she was queen of stars: there, first cradled and wrapt in
swaddling-clothes; then raised, in a moment of surprise, into his
wandering power,--is born the shepherd of the clouds, winged-footed and
deceiving,--blinding the eyes of Argus,--escaping from the grasp of
Apollo--restless messenger between the highest sky and topmost earth--
"the herald Mercury, new lighted on a heaven-kissing hill."


* On the altar of Hermes on its summit, as on that of the Lacinian Hera,
no wind ever stirred the ashes.  By those altars, the Gods of Heaven were
appeased, and all their storms at rest.


27.  Now, it will be wholly impossible, at present, to trace for you any
of the minor Greek expressions of this thought, except only that Mercury,
as the cloud shepherd, is especially called Eriophoros, the wool-bearer.
You will recollect the name from the common woolly rush "eriophorum"
which has a cloud of silky seed; and note also that he wears
distinctively the flap cap, petasos, named from a word meaning "to
expand;" which shaded from the sun, and is worn on journeys.  You have
the epithet of mountains "cloud-capped" as an established form with every
poet, and the Mont Pilate of Lucerne is named from a Latin word
signifying specially a woollen cap; but Mercury has, besides, a general
Homeric epithet, curiously and intensely concentrated in meaning, "the
profitable or serviceable by wool,"* that is to say, by shepherd wealth;
hence, "pecuniarily," rich or serviceable, and so he passes at last into
a general mercantile deity; while yet the cloud sense of the wool is
retained by Homer always, so that he gives him this epithet when it would
otherwise have been quite meaningless (in Iliad, xxiv. 440), when he
drives Priam's chariot, and breathes force into his horses, precisely as
we shall find Athena drive Diomed; and yet the serviceable and profitable
sense--and something also of gentle and soothing character in the mere
wool-softness, as used for dress, and religious rites--is retained also
in the epithet, and thus the gentle and serviceable Hermes is opposed to
the deceitful one.


* I am convinced that the 'eri' in 'eriounios' is not intensitive, but
retained from 'erion'; but even if I am wrong in thinking this, the
mistake is of no consequence with respect to the general force of the
term as meaning the profitableness of Hermes.  Athena's epithet of
'ageleia' has a parallel significance. [Transcriber's note: words inside
single apostrophes are Greek, and use the Greek alphabet.]


28.  In connection with this driving of Priam's chariot, remember that
as Autolycus is the son of Hermes the Deceiver, Myrtilus (the Auriga
of the  Stars) is the son of Hermes the Guide.  The name Hermes itself
means impulse; and he is especially the shepherd of the flocks of the
sky, in driving, or guiding, or stealing them; and yet his great
name, Argeiphontes, not only--as in different passages of the olden
poets--means "Shining White," which is said of him as being himself the
silver cloud lighted by the sun; but "Argus-killer," the killer of
rightness, which is said of him as he veils the sky, and especially the
stars, which are the eyes of Argus; or, literally, eyes of brightness,
which Juno, who is, with Jupiter, part of the type of highest heaven,
keeps in her peacock's train.  We know that this interpretation is
right, from a passage in which Euripides describes the shield of
Hippomedon, which bore for his sign, "Argus the all-seeing, covered
with eyes; open towards the rising of the stars and closed towards
their setting."

And thus Hermes becomes the spirit of the movement of the sky or
firmament; not merely the fast flying of the transitory cloud, but the
great motion of the heavens and stars themselves.  Thus, in his highest
power, he corresponds to the "primo mobile" of the later Italian
philosophy, and, in his simplest, is the guide of all mysterious and
cloudy movement, and of all successful subtleties.  Perhaps the prettiest
minor recognition of his character is when, on the night foray of Ulysses
and Diomed, Ulysses wear the helmet stolen by Autolycus, the son of
Hermes.

29.  The position in the Greek mind of Hermes as the lord of cloud is,
however, more mystic and ideal than that of any other deity, just on
account of the constant and real presence of the cloud itself under
different forms, giving rise to all kinds of minor fables.  The play of
the Greek imagination in this direction is so wide and complex, that I
cannot give you an outline of its range in my present limits.  There is
first a great series of storm-legends connected with the family of the
historic Æolus centralized by the story of Athamas, with his two wives,
"the Cloud," and the "White Goddess," ending in that of Phrixus and
Helle, and of the golden fleece (which is only the cloud-burden of Hermes
Eriophoros).  With this, there is the fate of Salmoneus, and the
destruction of the Glaucus by his own horses; all these minor myths of
storm concentrating themselves darkly into the legend of Bellerophon and
the Chimæra, in which there is an under story about the vain subduing of
passion and treachery, and the end of life in fading melancholy,--which,
I hope, not many of you could understand even were I to show it you (the
merely physical meaning of the Chimæra is the cloud of volcanic lightning
connected wholly with earth-fire, but resembling the heavenly cloud in
its height and its thunder).  Finally, in the Æolic group, there is the
legend of Sisypus, which I mean to work out thoroughly by itself; its
root is in the position of Corinth as ruling the isthmus and the two seas
--the Corinthean Acropolis, two thousand feet high, being the centre of
the crossing currents of the winds, and of the commerce of Greece.
Therefore, Athena, and the fountain-cloud Pegasus, are more closely
connected with Corinth than even with Athens in their material, though
not in their moral, power; and Sisyphus founds the Isthmian games in
connection with a melancholy story about the sea gods; but he himself is
'kerdotos andron', the most "gaining" and subtle of men; who having the
key of the Isthmus, becomes the type of transit, transfer, or trade, as
such; and of the apparent gain from it, which is not gain; and this is
the real meaning of his punishment in hell--eternal toil and recoil (the
modern idol of capital being, indeed, the stone of Sisyphus with a
vengeance, crushing in its recoil).  But, throughout, the old ideas of
the cloud power and cloud feebleness,--the deceit of its hiding,--and the
emptiness of its banishing,--the Autolycus enchantment of making black
seem white,--and the disappointed fury of Ixion (taking shadow for
power), mingle in the moral meaning of this and its collateral legends;
and give an aspect, at last, not only of foolish cunning, but of impiety
or literal "idolatry," "imagination worship," to the dreams of avarice
and injustice, until this notion of atheism and insolent blindness
becomes principal; and the "Clouds" of Aristophanes, with the personified
"just" and "unjust" sayings in the latter part of the play, foreshadow,
almost feature by feature, in all that they were written to mock and to
chastise, the worst elements of the impious "'dinos'" and tumult in men's
thoughts, which have followed on their avarice in the present day, making
them alike forsake the laws of their ancient gods, and misapprehended or
reject the true words of their existing teachers.

30.  All this we have from the legends of the historic Æolus only; but,
besides these, there is the beautiful story of Semele, the mother of
Bacchus.  She is the cloud with the strength of the vine in its bosom,
consumed by the light which matures the fruit; the melting away of the
cloud into the clean air at the fringe of its edges being exquisitely
rendered by Pindar's epithet for her, Semele, "with the stretched-out
hair" ('tauuetheira'.)  Then there is the entire tradition of the
Danaides, and of the tower of Danaë and golden shower; the birth of
Perseus connecting this legend with that of the Gorgons and Graiæ, who
are the true clouds of thunderous ruin and tempest.  I must, in passing,
mark for you that the form of the sword or sickle of Perseus, with which
he kills Medusa, is another image of the whirling harpy vortex, and
belongs especially to the sword of destruction or annihilation; whence it
is given to the two angels who gather for destruction the evil harvest
and evil vintage of the earth (Rev. xiv. 15).  I will collect afterwards
and complete what I have already written respecting the Pegasean and
Gorgonian legends, noting here only what is necessary to explain the
central myth of Athena herself, who represents the ambient air, which
included all cloud, and rain, and dew, and darkness, and peace, and wrath
of heaven.  Let me now try to give you, however briefly, some distinct
idea of the several agencies of this great goddess.

31.  I.  She is the air giving life and health to all animals.
     II.  She is the air giving vegetative power to the earth.
     III.  She is the air giving motion to the sea, and rendering
           navigation possible.
     IV.  She is the air nourishing artificial light, torch or lamplight;
          as opposed to that of the sun, on one hand, and of consuming*
          fire on the other.
     V.  She is the air conveying vibration of sound.


* Not a scientific, but a very practical and expressive distinction.


I will give you instances of her agency in all these functions.

32.  First, and chiefly, she is air as the spirit of life, giving
vitality to the blood.  Her psychic relation to the vital force in matter
lies deeper, and we will examine it afterwards; but a great number of the
most interesting passages in Homer regard her as flying over the earth in
local and transitory strength, simply and merely the goddess of fresh
air.

It is curious that the British city which has somewhat saucily styled
itself the Modern Athens is indeed more under her especial tutelage and
favor in this respect than perhaps any other town in the island.  Athena
is first simply what in the Modern Athens you practically find her, the
breeze of the mountain and the sea; and wherever she comes, there is
purification, and health, and power.  The sea-beach round this isle of
ours is the frieze of our Parthenon; every wave that breaks on it
thunders with Athena's voice; nay, wherever you throw your window wide
open in the morning, you let in Athena, as wisdom and fresh air at the
same instant; and whenever you draw a pure, long, full breath of right
heaven, you take Athena into your heart, through your blood; and, with
the blood, into the thoughts of your brain.

Now, this giving of strength by the air, observe, is mechanical as well
as chemical.  You cannot strike a good blow but with your chest full;
and, in hand to hand fighting, it is not the muscle that fails first, it
is the breath; the longest-breathed will, on the average, be the victor,
--not the strongest.  Note how Shakespeare always leans on this.  Of
Mortimer, in "changing hardiment with great Glendower":

"Three times they breathed, and three times did they drink,
Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood."

And again, Hotspur, sending challenge to Prince Harry:

      "That none might draw short breath to-day
      But I and Harry Monmouth."

Again, of Hamlet, before he receives his wound:

      "He's fat, and scant of breath."

Again, Orlando in the wrestling:

      "Yes; I beseech your grace
      I am not yet well breathed."

Now, of all the people that ever lived, the Greeks knew best what breath
meant, both in exercise and in battle, and therefore the queen of the air
becomes to them at once the queen of bodily strength in war; not mere
brutal muscular strength,--that belongs to Ares,--but the strength of
young lives passed in pure air and swift exercise,--Camilla's virginal
force, that "flies o'er the unbending corn, and skims along the main."

33.  Now I will rapidly give you two or three instances of her direct
agency in this function.  First, when she wants to make Penelope bright
and beautiful; and to do away with the signs of her waiting and her
grief.  "Then Athena thought of another thing; she laid her into a deep
sleep, and loosed all her limbs, and made her taller, and made her
smoother, and fatter, and whiter than sawn ivory; and breathed ambrosial
brightness over her face; and so she left her and went up to heaven."
Fresh air and sound sleep at night, young ladies!  You see you may have
Athena for lady's maid whenever you choose.  Next, hark how she gives
strength to Achilles when he is broken with fasting and grief.  Jupiter
pities him and says to her, "'Daughter mine, are you forsaking your own
soldier, and don't you care for Achilles any more?  See how hungry and
weak he is,--go and feed him with ambrosia.'  So he urged the eager
Athena; and she leaped down out of heaven like a harpy falcon,
shrill-voiced; and she poured nectar and ambrosia, full of delight, into
the breast of Achilles, that his limbs might not fail with famine; then
she returned to the solid dome of her strong father."  And then comes the
great passage about Achilles arming--for which we have no time.  But here
is again Athena giving strength to the whole Greek army.  She came as a
falcon to Achilles, straight at him, a sudden drift of breeze; but to the
army she must come widely, she sweeps around them all.  "As when Jupiter
spreads the purple rainbow over heaven, portending battle or cold storm,
so Athena, wrapping herself round with a purple cloud, stooped to the
Greek soldiers, and raised up each of them."  Note that purple, in
Homer's use of it, nearly always means "fiery," "full of light."  It is
the light of the rainbow, not the color of it, which Homer means you to
think of.

34.  But the most curious passage of all, and fullest of meaning, is when
she gives strength to Menelaus, that he may stand unwearied against
Hector.  He prays to her: "And blue-eyed Athena was glad that he prayed
to her, first; and she gave him strength in his shoulders, and in his
limbs, an she gave him the courage"--of what animal, do you suppose?  Had
it been Neptune or Mars, they would have given him the courage of a bull,
or a lion; but Athena gives him the courage of the most fearless in
attack of all creatures, small or great, and very small it is, but wholly
incapable of terror,--she gives him the courage of a fly.

35.  Now this simile of Homer's is one of the best instances I can give
you of the way in which great writers seize truths unconsciously which
are for all time.  It is only recent science which has completely shown
the perfectness of this minute symbol of the power of Athena; proving
that the insect's flight and breath are co-ordinated; that its wings are
actually forcing-pumps, of which the stroke compels the thoracic
respiration; and that it thus breathes and flies simultaneously by the
action of the same muscles, so that respiration is carried on most
vigorously during flight, "while the air-vessels, supplied by many pairs
of lungs instead of one, traverse the organs of flight in far greater
numbers than the capillary blood-vessels of our own system, and give
enormous and untiring muscular power, a rapidity of action measured by
thousands of strokes in the minute, and an endurance, by miles and hours
of flight."*


* Ormerod: "Natural History of Wasps."


Homer could not have known this; neither that the buzzing of the fly
was produced, as in a wind instrument, by a constant current of air
through the trachea.  But he had seen, and, doubtless, meant us to
remember, the marvellous strength and swiftness of the insect's flight
(the glance of the swallow itself is clumsy and slow compared to the
darting of common house-flies at play); he probably attributed its
murmur to the wings, but in this also there was a type of what we shall
presently find recognized in the name of Pallas,--the vibratory power
of the air to convey sound, while, as a purifying creature, the fly holds
its place beside the old symbol of Athena in Egypt, the vulture; and as
a venomous and tormenting creature has more than the strength of the
serpent in proportion to its size, being thus entirely representative
of the influence of the air both in purification and pestilence; and its
courage is so notable that, strangely enough, forgetting Homer's simile,
I happened to take the fly for an expression of the audacity of freedom
in speaking of quite another subject.*  Whether it should be called
courage, or mere mechanical instinct, may be questioned, but assuredly
no other animal, exposed to continual danger, is so absolutely without
sign of fear.


* See farther on, §148, pp. 154-156.


36.  You will, perhaps, have still patience to hear two instances, not of
the communication as strength, but of the personal agency of Athena as
the air.  When she comes down to help Diomed against Ares, she does not
come to fight instead of him, but she takes his charioteer's place.

"She snatched the reins, she lashed with all her force,
And full on Mars impelled the foaming horse."

Ares is the first to cast his spear; then--note this--Pope says:

      "Pallas opposed her hand, and caused to glance,
      Far from the car, the strong immortal lance."

She does not oppose her hand in the Greek--the wind could not meet the
lance straight--she catches it in her hand, and throws it off.  There is
no instance in which a lance is so parried by a mortal hand in all the
Iliad, and it is exactly the way the wind would parry it, catching it,
and turning it aside.  If there are any good rifleshots here, they know
something about Athena's parrying; and in old times the English masters
of feathered artillery knew more yet.  Compare also the turning of
Hector's lance from Achilles: Iliad, xx. 439.

37.  The last instance I will give you is as lovely as it is subtile.
Throughout the Iliad, Athena is herself the will or Menis of Achilles.
If he is to be calmed, it is she who calms him; if angered, it is she
who inflames him.  In the first quarrel with Atreides, when he stands at
pause, with the great sword half drawn, "Athena came from heaven, and
stood behind him and caught him by the yellow hair."  Another god would
have stayed his hand upon the hilt, but Athena only lifts his hair.  "And
he turned and knew her, and her dreadful eyes shone upon him."  There is
an exquisite tenderness in this laying her hand upon his hair, for it is
the talisman of his life, vowed to his own Thessalian river if he ever
returned to its shore, and cast upon Patroclus' pile, so ordaining that
there should be no return.

38.  Secondly, Athena is the air giving vegetative impulse to the earth.
She is the wind and the rain, and yet more the pure air itself, getting
at the earth fresh turned by spade or plough, and, above all, feeding the
fresh leaves; for though the Greeks knew nothing about carbonic acid,
they did know that trees fed on the air.

Now, note first in this, the myth of the air getting at ploughed land.
You know I told you the Lord of all labor by which man lived was
Hephæstus; therefore Athena adopts a child of his, and of the Earth,--
Erichthonius,--literally, "the tearer up of the ground," who is the head
(though not in direct line) of the kings of Attica; and, having adopted
him, she gives him to be brought up by the three nymphs of the dew.  Of
these, Aglauros, the dweller in the fields, is the envy or malice of the
earth; she answers nearly to the envy of Cain, the tiller of the ground,
against his shepherd brother, in her own envy against her two sisters,
Herse, the cloud dew, who is the beloved of the shepherd Mercury; and
Pandrosos, the diffused dew, or dew of heaven.  Literally, you have in
this myth the words of the blessing of Esau: "Thy dwelling shall be of
the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above."  Aglauros
is for her envy turned into a black stone; and hers is one of the voices
--the other being that of Cain--which haunts the circle of envy in the
Purgatory:

      "Io sono Aglauro, chi divenne sasso."

But to her two sisters, with Erichthonius (or the hero Erectheus), is
built the most sacred temple of Athena in Athens; the temple to their own
dearest Athena--to her, and to the dew together; so that it was divided
into two parts: one, the temple of Athena of the city, and the other that
of the dew.  And this expression of her power, as the air bringing the
dew to the hill pastures, in the central temple of the central city of
the heathen, dominant over the future intellectual world, is, of all the
facts connected with her worship as the spirit of life, perhaps the most
important.  I have no time now to trace for you the hundredth part of the
different ways in which it bears both upon natural beauty, and on the
best order and happiness of men's lives.  I hope to follow out some of
these trains of thought in gathering together what I have to say about
field herbage; but I must say briefly here that the great sign, to the
Greeks, of the coming of spring in the pastures, was not, as with us, in
the primrose, but in the various flowers of the asphodel tribe (of which
I will give you some separate account presently); therefore it is that
the earth answers with crocus flame to the cloud on Ida; and the power
of Athena in eternal life is written by the light of the asphodel on the
Elysian fields.

But further, Athena is the air, not only to the lilies of the field, but
to the leaves of the forest.  We saw before the reason why Hermes is said
to be the son of Maia, the eldest of the sister stars of spring.  Those
stars are called not only Pleiades, but Vergiliæ, from a word mingling
the ideas of the turning or returning of springtime with the outpouring
of rain.  The mother of Vergil bearing the name of Maia, Vergil himself
received his name from the seven stars; and he, forming first the mind of
Dante, and through him that of Chaucer (besides whatever special minor
influence came from the Pastorals and Georgics) became the fountainhead
of all the best literary power connected with the love of vegetative
nature among civilized races of men.  Take the fact for what it is worth;
still it is a strange seal of coincidence, in word and in reality, upon
the Greek dream of the power over human life, and its purest thoughts, in
the stars of spring.  But the first syllable of the name of Vergil has
relation also to another group of words, of which the English ones,
virtue and virgin, bring down the force to modern days.  It is a group
containing mainly the idea of "spring," or increase of life in
vegetation--the rising of the new branch of the tree out of the bud, and
of the new leaf out of the ground.  It involves, secondarily, the idea
of greenness and of strength, but, primarily, that of living increase of
a new rod from a stock, stem, or root ("There shall come forth a rod out
of the stem of Jesse"); and chiefly the stem of certain plants--either of
the rose tribe, as in the budding of the almond rod of Aaron; or of the
olive tribe, which has triple significance in this symbolism, from the
use of its oil for sacred anointing, for strength in the gymnasium, and
for light.  Hence, in numberless divided and reflected ways, it is
connected with the power of Hercules and Athena: Hercules plants the wild
olive, for its shade, on the course of Olympia, and it thenceforward
gives the Olympic crown of consummate honor and rest; while the prize at
the Panathenaic games is a vase of its oil (meaning encouragement to
continuance of effort); and from the paintings on these Panathenaic vases
we get the most precious clue to the entire character of Athena.  Then to
express its propagation by slips, the trees from which the oil was to be
taken were called "Moriai," trees of division (being all descendents of
the sacred one in the Erechtheum).  And thus, in one direction, we get to
the "children like olive plants round about thy table" and the olive
grafting of St. Paul; while the use of the oil for anointing gives chief
name to the rod itself of the stem of Jesse, and to all those who were by
that name signed for his disciples first in Antioch.  Remember, further,
since that name was first given the influence of the symbol, both in
extreme unction and in consecration of priests and kings to their "divine
right;" and thing, if you can reach with any grasp of thought, what the
influence on the earth has been, of those twisted branches whose leaves
give gray bloom to the hillsides under every breeze that blows from the
midland sea.  But, above and beyond all, think how strange it is that the
chief Agonia of humanity, and the chief giving of strength from heaven
for its fulfilment, should have been under its night shadow in Palestine.

39.  Thirdly, Athena is the air in its power over the sea.

On the earliest Panathenaic vase known--the "Burgon" vase in the British
museum--Athena has a dolphin on her shield.  The dolphin has two
principal meanings in Greek symbolism.  It means, first, the sea;
secondarily, the ascending and descending course of any of the heavenly
bodies from one sea horizon to another--the dolphins' arching rise and
replunge (in a summer evening, out of calm sea, their black backs roll
round with exactly the slow motion of a water-wheel; but I do not know
how far Aristotle's exaggerated account of their leaping or their
swiftness has any foundation) being taken as a type of the emergence
of the sun or stars from the sea in the east, and plunging beneath in the
west.  Hence, Apollo, when in his personal power he crosses the sea,
leading his Cretan colonists to Pytho, takes the form of a dolphin,
becomes Apollo Delphinius, and names the founded colony "Delphi."  The
lovely drawing of the Delphic Apollo on the hydria of the Vatican (Le
Normand and De Witte, vol. ii. p. 6) gives the entire conception of this
myth.  Again, the beautiful coins of Tarentum represent Taras coming to
found the city, riding on a dolphin, whose leaps and plunges have partly
the rage of the sea in them, and partly the spring of the horse, because
the splendid riding of the Tarentines had made their name proverbial in
Magna Græca.  The story of Arion is a collateral fragment of the same
thought; and, again, the plunge, before their transformation, of the
ships of Æneas.  Then, this idea of career upon, or conquest of, or by
dolphin-like ships (compare the Merlin prophecy,

            "They shall ride
            Over ocean wide
      With hempen bridle, ad horse of tree,")

connects itself with the thought of undulation, and of the wave-power in
the sea itself, which is always expressed by the serpentine bodies either
of the sea-gods or of the sea-horse; and when Athena carries, as she does
often in later work, a serpent for her shield-sign, it is not so much the
repetition of her own ægis-snakes as the further expression of her power
over the sea-wave; which, finally, Vergil gives in its perfect unity with
her own anger, in the approach of the serpents against Laocoön from the
sea; and then, finally, when her own storm-power is fully put forth on
the ocean also, and the madness of the ægis-snake is give to the
wave-snake, the sea-wave becomes the devouring hound at the waist of
Scylla, and Athena takes Scylla for her helmet-crest; while yet her
beneficent and essential power on the ocean, in making navigation
possible, is commemorated in the Panathenaic festival by her peplus being
carried to the Erechtheum suspended from the mast of a ship.

In Plate cxv. of vol. ii, Le Normand, are given two sides of a vase,
which, in rude and childish ways, assembles most of the principal
thoughts regarding Athena in this relation.  In the first, the sunrise is
represented by the ascending chariot of Apollo, foreshortened; the light
is supposed to blind the eyes, and no face of the god is seen (Turner, in
the Ulysses and Polyphemus sunrise, loses the form of the god in light,
giving the chariot-horses only; rendering in his own manner, after 2,200
years of various fall and revival of the arts, precisely the same thought
as the old Greek potter).  He ascends out of the sea; but the sea itself
has not yet caught the light.  In the second design, Athena as the
morning breeze, and Hermes as the morning cloud, fly over the sea before
the sun.  Hermes turns back his head; his face is unseen in the cloud, as
Apollo's in the light; the grotesque appearance of an animal's face is
only the cloud-phantasm modifying a frequent form of the hair of Hermes
beneath the back of his cap.  Under the morning breeze, the dolphins leap
from the rippled sea, and their sides catch the light.

The coins of the Lucanian Heracleia give a fair representation of the
helmed Athena, as imagined in later Greek art, with the embossed Scylla.

40.  Fourthly, Athena is the air nourishing artificial light--unconsuming
fire.  Therefore, a lamp was always kept burning in the Erechtheum; and
the torch-race belongs chiefly to her festival, of which the meaning is
to show the danger of the perishing of the light even by excess of the
air that nourishes it; and so that the race is not to the swift, but to
the wise.  The household use of her constant light is symbolized in the
lovely passage in the Odyssey, where Ulysses and his son move the armor
while the servants are shut in their chambers, and there is no one to
hold the torches for them; but Athena herself, "having a golden lamp,"
fills all the rooms with light.  Her presence in war-strength with her
favorite heroes is always shown by the "unwearied" fire hovering on their
helmets and shields; and the image gradually becomes constant and
accepted, both for the maintenance of household watchfulness, as in the
parable of the ten virgins, or as the symbol of direct inspiration, in
the rushing wind and divided flames of Pentecost; but together with this
thought of unconsuming and constant fire, there is always mingled in the
Greek mind the sense of the consuming by excess, as of the flame by the
air, so also of the inspired creature by its own fire (thus, again, "the
zeal of thine house hath eaten me up"--"my zeal hath consumed me, because
of thine enemies," and the like); and especially Athena has this aspect
towards the truly sensual and bodily strength; so that to Ares, who is
himself insane and consuming, the opposite wisdom seems to be insane and
consuming: "All we the other gods have thee against us, O Jove! when we
would give grace to men; for thou hast begotten the maid without a mind--
the mischievous creature, the doer of unseemly evil.  All we obey thee,
and are ruled by thee.  Her only thou wilt not resist in anything she
says or does, because thou didst bear her--consuming child as she is."

41.  Lastly, Athena is the air conveying vibration of sound.

In all the loveliest representations in central Greek art of the birth
of Athena, Apollo stands close to the sitting Jupiter, singing, with a
deep, quiet joyfulness, to his lyre.  The sun is always thought of as the
master of time and rhythm, and as the origin of the composing and
inventive discovery of melody; but the air, as the actual element and
substance of the voice, the prolonging and sustaining power of it, and
the symbol of its moral passion.  Whatever in music is measured and
designed belongs therefore to Apollo and the Muses; whatever is impulsive
and passionate, to Athena; hence her constant strength a voice or cry (as
when she aids the shout of Achilles) curiously opposed to the dumbness of
Demeter.  The Apolline lyre, therefore, is not so much the instrument
producing sound, as its measurer and divider by length or tension of
string into given notes; and I believe it is, in a double connection with
its office as a measurer of time or motion and its relation to the
transit of the sun in the sky, that Hermes forms it from the
tortoise-shell, which is the image of the dappled concave of the cloudy
sky.  Thenceforward all the limiting or restraining modes of music belong
to the Muses; but the more passionate music is wind music, as in the
Doric flute.  Then, when this inspired music becomes degraded in its
passion, it sinks into the pipe of Pan, and the double pipe of Marsyas,
and is then rejected by Athena.  The myth which represents her doing so
is that she invented the double pipe from hearing the hiss of the
Gorgonian serpents; but when she played upon it, chancing to see her face
reflected in water, she saw that it was distorted, whereupon she threw
down the flute which Marsyas found.  Then, the strife of Apollo and
Marsyas represents the enduring contest between music in which the words
and thought lead, and the lyre measures or melodizes them (which Pindar
means when he calls his hymns "kings over the lyre"), and music in which
the words are lost and the wind or impulse leads,--generally, therefore,
between intellectual, and brutal, or meaningless, music.  Therefore, when
Apollo prevails, he flays Marsyas, taking the limit and external bond of
his shape from him, which is death, without touching the mere muscular
strength, yet shameful and dreadful in dissolution.

42.  And the opposition of these two kinds of sound is continually dwelt
upon by the Greek philosophers, the real fact at the root of all music is
the natural expression of a lofty passion for a right cause; that in
proportion to the kingliness and force of any personality, the expression
either of its joy or suffering becomes measured, chastened, calm, and
capable of interpretation only by the majesty of ordered, beautiful, and
worded sound.  Exactly in proportion to the degree in which we become
narrow in the cause and conception of our passions, incontinent in the
utterance of them, feeble of perseverance in them, sullied or shameful in
the indulgence of them, their expression by musical sound becomes broken,
mean, fatuitous, and at last impossible; the measured waves of the air of
heaven will not lend themselves to expression of ultimate vice, it must
be forever sunk into discordance or silence.  And since, as before
stated, every work of right art has a tendency to reproduce the ethical
state which first developed it, this, which of all the arts is most
directly in power of discipline; the first, the simplest, the most
effective of all instruments of moral instruction; while in the failure
and betrayal of its functions, it becomes the subtlest aid of moral
degradation.  Music is thus, in her health, the teacher of perfect order,
and is the voice of the obedience of angels, and the companion of the
course of the spheres of heaven; and in her depravity she is also the
teacher of perfect disorder and disobedience, and the Gloria in Excelsis
becomes the Marseillaise.  In the third section of this volume, I reprint
two chapters from another essay of mine ("The Cestus of Aglaia"), on
modesty or measure, and on liberty, containing further reference to music
in her two powers; and I do this now, because, among the many monstrous
and misbegotten fantasies which are the spawn of modern license, perhaps
the most impishly opposite to the truth is the conception of music which
has rendered possible the writing, by educated persons, and, more
strangely yet, the tolerant criticism, of such words as these: "This so
persuasive art is the only one that has no didactic efficacy, that
engenders no emotions save such as are without issue on the side of moral
truth, that expresses nothing of God, nothing of reason, nothing of human
liberty."  I will not give the author's name; the passage is quoted in
the "Westminster Review" for last January [1869].

43.  I must also anticipate something of what I have to say respecting
the relation of the power of Athena to organic life, so far as to note
that her name, Pallas, probably refers to the quivering or vibration of
the air; and to its power, whether as vital force, or communicated wave,
over every kind of matter, in giving it vibratory movement; first, and
most intense, in the voice and throat of the bird, which is the air
incarnate; and so descending through the various orders of animal life to
the vibrating and semi-voluntary murmur of the insect; and, lower still,
to the hiss or quiver of the tail of the half-lunged snake and deaf
adder; all these, nevertheless, being wholly under the rule of Athena as
representing either breath or vital nervous power; and, therefore, also,
in their simplicity, the "oaten pipe and pastoral song," which belong to
her dominion over the asphodel meadows, and breathe on their banks of
violets.

Finally, is it not strange to think of the influence of this one power of
Pallas in vibration (we shall see a singular mechanical energy of it
presently in the serpent's motion), in the voices of war and peace?  How
much of the repose, how much of the wrath, folly, and misery of men, has
literally depended on this one power of the air; on the sound of the
trumpet and of the bell, on the lark's song, and the bee's murmur!

44.  Such is the general conception in the Greek mind of the physical
power of Athena.  The spiritual power associated with it is of two kinds:
first, she is the Spirit of Life in material organism; not strength in
the blood only, but formative energy in the clay; and, secondly, she is
inspired and impulsive wisdom in human conduct and human art, giving the
instinct of infallible decision, and of faultless invention.

It is quite beyond the scope of my present purpose--and, indeed, will
only be possible for me at all after marking the relative intention of
the Apolline myths--to trace for you the Greek conception of Athena as
the guide of moral passion.  But I will at least endeavor, on some near
occasion,* to define some of the actual truths respecting the vital force
in created organism, and inventive fancy in the works of man, which are
more or less expressed by the Greeks, under the personality of Athena.
You would, perhaps, hardly bear with me if I endeavored further to show
you--what is nevertheless perfectly true--the analogy between the
spiritual power of Athena in her gentle ministry, yet irresistible anger,
with the ministry of anther Spirit whom we also, holding for the
universal power of life, are forbidden, at our worst peril, to quench or
to grieve.


* I have tried to do this in mere outline in the two following sections
of this volume.


45.  But, I think, to-night, you should not let me close without
requiring of me an answer on one vital point, namely, how far these
imaginations of gods--which are vain to us--were vain to those who had
no better trust? and what real belief the Greek had in these creations
of his own spirit, practical and helpful to him in the sorrow of earth?
I am able to answer you explicitly in this.  The origin of his thoughts
is often obscure, and we may err in endeavoring to account or their form
of realization; but the effect of that realization on his life is not
obscure at all.  The Greek creed was, of course, different in its
character, as our own creed is, according to the class of persons who
held it.  The common people's was quite literal, simple, and happy; their
idea of Athena was as clear as a good Roman Catholic peasant's idea of
the Madonna.  In Athens itself, the centre of thought and refinement,
Pisistratus obtained the reins of government through the ready belief of
the populace that a beautiful woman, armed like Athena, was the goddess
herself.  Even at the close of the last century some of this simplicity
remained among the inhabitants of the Greek islands; and when a pretty
English lady first made her way into the grotto of Antiparos, she was
surrounded, on her return, by all the women of the neighboring village,
believing her to be divine, and praying her to heal them of their
sicknesses.

46.  Then, secondly, the creed of the upper classes was more refined and
spiritual, but quite as honest, and even more forcible in its effect on
the life.  You might imagine that the employment of the artifice just
referred to implied utter unbelief in the persons contriving it; but it
really meant only that the more worldly of them would play with a popular
faith of their own purposes, as doubly-minded persons have often done
since, all the while sincerely holding the same ideas themselves in a
more abstract form; while the good and unworldly men, the true Greek
heroes, lived by their faith as firmly as St. Louis, or the Cid, or the
Chevalier Bayard.

47.  Then, thirdly, the faith of the poets and artists was, necessarily,
less definite, being continually modified by the involuntary action of
their own fancies; and by the necessity of presenting, in clear verbal or
material form, things of which they had no authoritative knowledge.
Their faith was, in some respects like Dante's or Milton's: firm in
general conception, but not able to vouch for every detail in the forms
they gave it; but they went considerably farther, even in that minor
sincerity, than subsequent poets; and strove with all their might to be
as near the truth as they could.  Pindar says, quite simply, "I cannot
think so-and-so of the gods.  It must have been this way--it cannot have
been that way--that the thing was done."  And as late among the Latins as
the days of Horace, this sincerity remains.  Horace is just as true and
simple in his religion as Wordsworth; but all power of understanding any
of the honest classic poets has been taken away from most English
gentlemen by the mechanical drill in verse-writing at school.  Throughout
the whole of their lives afterwards, they never can get themselves quit
of the notion that all verses were written as an exercise, and that
Minerva was only a convenient word for the last of a hexameter, and
Jupiter for the last but one.

48.  It is impossible that any notion can be more fallacious or more
misleading in its consequences.  All great song, from the first day when
human lips contrived syllables, has been sincere song.  With deliberate
didactic purpose the tragedians--with pure and native passion the lyrists
--fitted their perfect words to their dearest faiths.  "Operosa parvus
carmina fingo."  "I, little thing that I am, weave my laborious songs" as
earnestly as the bee among the bells of thyme on the Matin mountains. Yes,
and he dedicates his favorite pine to Diana, and he chants his autumnal
hymn to the Faun that guards his fields, and he guides the noble youth and
maids of Rome in their choir to Apollo, and he tells the farmer's little
girl that the gods will love her, though she has only a handful of salt
and meal to give them--just as earnestly as ever English gentleman taught
Christian faith to English youth in England's truest days.

49.  Then, lastly, the creed of the philosophers of sages varied
according to the character and knowledge of each; their relative
acquaintance with the secrets of natural science, their intellectual and
sectarian egotism, and their mystic or monastic tendencies, for there is
a classic as well as a mediæval monasticism.  They end in losing the life
of Greece in play upon words; but we owe to their early thought some of
the soundest ethics, and the foundation of the best practical laws, yet
known to mankind.

50.  Such was the general vitality of the heathen creed in its strength.
Of its direct influence on conduct, it is, as I said, impossible for me
to speak now; only, remember always, in endeavoring to form a judgment of
it, that what of good or right the heathens did, they did looking for no
reward.  The purest forms of our own religion have always consisted in
sacrificing less things to win greater, time to win eternity, the world
to win the skies.  The order, "Sell that thou hast," is not given without
the promise, "Thou shalt have treasure in heaven;" and well for the
modern Christian if he accepts the alternative as his Master left it, and
does not practically read the command and promise thus: "Sell that thou
hast in the best market, and thou shalt have treasure in eternity also."
But the poor Greeks of the great ages expected no reward from heaven but
honor, and no reward from earth but rest; though, when, on those
conditions, they patiently, and proudly, fulfilled their task of the
granted day, an unreasoning instinct of an immortal benediction broke
from their lips in song; and they, even they, had sometimes a prophet to
tell them of a land "where there is sun alike by day and alike by night,
where they shall need no more to trouble the earth by strength of hands
for daily bread; but the ocean breezes blow around the blessed islands,
and golden flowers burn on their bright trees for evermore."

ATHENA KERAMITIS.*

(Athena in the Earth.)


* "Athena, fit for being made into pottery."  I coin the expression as a
counterpart of 'ge parthenia', "Clay intact."


STUDY, SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE PRECEDING LECTURE, OF THE SUPPOSED AND
      ACTUAL RELATIONS OF ATHENA TO THE VITAL FORCE IN MATERIAL ORGANISM


51.  It has been easy to decipher approximately the Greek conception of
the physical power of Athena in cloud and sky, because we know ourselves
what clouds and skies are, and what the force of the wind is in forming
them.  But it is not at all easy to trace the Greek thoughts about the
power of Athena in giving life, because we do not ourselves know clearly
what life is, or in what way the air is necessary to it, or what there
is, besides the air, shaping the forms that it is put into.  And it is
comparatively of small consequence to find out what the Greeks thought
or meant, until we have determined what we ourselves think, or mean, when
we translate the Greek word for "breathing" into the Latin-English word
"spirit."

52.  But it is of great consequence that you should fix in your minds--
and hold, against the baseness of mere materialism on the one hand, and
against the fallacies of controversial speculation on the other--the
certain and practical sense of this word "spirit;" the sense in which you
all know that its reality exists, as the power which shaped you into your
shape, and by which you love and hate when you have received that shape.
You need not fear, on the one hand, that either the sculpturing or the
loving power can ever be beaten down by the philosophers into a metal, or
evolved by them into a gas; but on the other hand, take care that you
yourself, in trying to elevate your conception of it, do not lose its
truth in a dream, or even in a word.  Beware always of contending for
words: you will find them not easy to grasp, if you know them in several
languages.  This very word, which is so solemn in your mouths, is one of
the most doubtful.  In Latin it means little more than breathing, and may
mean merely accent; in French it is not breath, but wit, and our
neighbors are therefore obliged, even in their most solemn expressions,
to say "wit" when we say "ghost."  In Greek, "pneuma," the word we
translate "ghost," means either wind or breath, and the relative word
"psyche" has, perhaps, a more subtle power; yet St. Paul's words
"pneumatic body" and "psychic body" involve a difference in his mind
which no words will explain.  But in Greek and in English, and in Saxon
and in Hebrew, and in every articulate tongue of humanity the "spirit of
man" truly means his passion and virtue, and is stately according to the
height of his conception, and stable according to the measure of his
endurance.

53. Endurance, or patience, that is the central sign of spirit; a
constancy against the cold and agony of death; and as, physically, it is
by the burning power of the air that the heat of the flesh is sustained,
so this Athena, spiritually, is the queen of all glowing virtue, the
unconsuming fire and inner lamp of life.  And thus, as Hephæstus is lord
of the fire of the hand, and Apollo of the fire of the brain, so Athena
of the fire of the heart; and as Hercules wears for his chief armor the
skin of the Nemean lion, his chief enemy, whom he slew; and Apollo has
for his highest name "the Pythian," from his chief enemy, the Python
slain; so Athena bears always on her breast the deadly face of her chief
enemy slain, the Gorgonian cold, and venomous agony, that turns living
men to stone.

54.  And so long as you have the fire of the heart within you, and know
the reality of it, you need to be under no alarm as to the possibility
of its chemical or mechanical analysis.  The philosophers are very
humorous in their ecstasy of hope about it; but the real interest of
their discoveries in this direction is very small to humankind.  It is
quite true that the tympanum of the ear vibrates under sound, and that
the surface of the water in a ditch vibrates too; but the ditch hears
nothing for all that; and my hearing is still to me as blessed a mystery
as ever, and the interval between the ditch and me quite as great.  If
the trembling sound in my ears was once of the marriage-bell which began
my happiness, and is now of the passing-bell which ends it, the
difference between those two sounds to me cannot be counted by the number
of concussions.  There have been some curious speculations lately as to
the conveyance of mental consciousness by "brain-waves."  What does it
matter how it is conveyed?  The consciousness itself is not a wave.  It
may be accompanied here or there by any quantity of quivers and shakes,
up or down, of anything you can find in the universe that is shakable--
what is that to me?  My friend is dead, and my--according to modern views
--vibratory sorrow is not one whit less, or less mysterious, to me, than
my old quiet one.

55.  Beyond, and entirely unaffected by, any questionings of this kind,
there are, therefore, two plain facts which we should all know: first,
that there is a power which gives their several shapes to things, or
capacities of feeling; and that we can increase or destroy both of these
at our will.  By care and tenderness, we can extend the range of lovely
life in plants and animals; by our neglect and cruelty, we can arrest it,
and bring pestilence in its stead.  Again, by right discipline we can
increase our strength of noble will and passion or destroy both.  And
whether these two forces are local conditions of the elements in which
they appear, or are part of a great force in the universe, out of which
they are taken, and to which they must be restored, is not of the
slightest importance to us in dealing with them; neither is the manner
of their connection with light and air.  What precise meaning we ought to
attach to expressions such as that of the prophecy to the four winds that
the dry bones might be breathed upon, and might live, or why the presence
of the vital power should be dependent on the chemical action of air, and
its awful passing away materially signified by the rendering up of that
breath or ghost, we cannot at present know, and need not at any time
dispute.  What we assuredly know is that the states of life and death are
different, and the first more desirable than the other, and by effort
attainable, whether we understand being "born of the spirit" to signify
having the breath of heaven in our flesh, or its power in our hearts.

56.  As to its power on the body, I will endeavor to tell you, having
been myself much led into studies involving necessary reference both to
natural science and mental phenomena, what, at least, remains to us after
science has done its worst; what the myth of Athena, as a formative and
decisive power, a spirit of creation and volition, must eternally mean
for all of us.

57.  It is now (I believe I may use the strong word) "ascertained" that
heat and motion are fixed in quantity, and measurable in the portions
that we deal with.  We can measure portions of power, as we can measure
portions of space; while yet, as far as we know, space may be infinite,
and force infinite.  There may be heat as much greater than the sun's, as
the sun's heat is greater than a candle's: and force as much greater than
the force by which the world swings, as that is greater than the force by
which a cobweb trembles.  Now, on hear and force, life is inseparably
dependent; and I believe, also, on a form of substance, which the
philosophers call "protoplasm."  I wish they would use English instead of
Greek words.  When I want to know why a leaf is green, they tell me it is
colored by "chlorophyll," which at first sounds very instructive; but if
they would only say plainly that a leaf is colored green by a thing which
is called "green leaf," we should see more precisely how far we had got.
However, it is a curious fact that life is connected with a cellular
structure called protoplasm, or in English, "first stuck together;"
whence, conceivably through deuteroplasms, or second stickings, and
tritoplasms, or third stickings,* we reach the highest plastic phase in
the human pottery, which differs from common chinaware, primarily, by a
measurable degree of heat, developed in breathing, which it borrows from
the rest of the universe while it lives, and which it as certainly
returns to the rest of the universe, when it dies.

58.  Again, with this heat certain assimilative powers are connected,
which the tendency of recent discovery is to simplify more and more into
modes of one force; or finally into mere motion, communicable in various
states, but not destructible.  We will assume that science has done its
utmost; and that every chemical or animal force is demonstrably
resolvable into heat or motion, reciprocally changing into each other.
I would myself like better, in order of thought, to consider motion as a
mode of heat than heat as a mode of motion; still, granting that we have
got thus far, we have yet to ask, What is heat? or what is motion?  What
is this "primo mobile," this transitional power, in which all things
live, and move, and have their being?  It is by definition something
different from matter, and we may call it as we choose, "first cause," or
"first light," or "first heat;" but we can show no scientific proof of
its not being personal, and coinciding with the ordinary conception of a
supporting spirit in all things.

59.  Still, it is not advisable to apply the word "spirit" or "breathing"
to it, while it is only enforcing chemical affinities; but, when the
chemical affinities are brought under the influence of the air, and of
the sun's heat, the formative force enters and entirely different phase.
It does not now merely crystallize indefinite masses, but it gives to
limited portions of matter the power of gathering, selectively, other
elements proper to them, and binding those elements into their own
peculiar and adopted form.

This force, now properly called life, or breathing, or spirit, is
continually creating its own shell of definite shape out of the wreck
around it; and this is what I meant by saying, in the "Ethics of the
Dust," "you may always stand by form against force."  For the mere force
of junction is not spirit; but the power that catches out of chaos
charcoal, water, lime, or what not, and fastens them down into a given
form, is properly called "spirit;" and we shall not diminish, but
strengthen our conception of this creative energy by recognizing its
presence in lower states of matter than our own; such recognition being
enforced upon us by delight we instinctively receive from all the forms
of matter which manifest it; and yet more, by the glorifying of those
forms, in the parts of them that are most animated, with the colors that
are pleasantest to our senses.  The most familiar instance of this is the
best, and also the most wonderful: the blossoming of plants.

60.  The spirit in the plant--that is to say, its power of gathering dead
matter out of the wreck round it, and shaping it into its own chosen
shape--is of course strongest at the moment of its flowering, for it then
not only gathers, but forms, with the greatest energy.

And where this life is in at full power, its form becomes invested with
aspects that are chiefly delightful to our own human passions; namely, at
first, with the loveliest outlines of shape; and, secondly, with the most
brilliant phases of the primary colors, blue, yellow, and red or white,
the unison of all; and, to make it all more strange, this time of
peculiar and perfect glory is associated with relations of the plants or
blossoms to each other, correspondent to the joy of love in human
creatures, and having the same object in the continuance of the race.
Only, with respect to plants, as animals, we are wrong in speaking as if
the object of this strong life were only the bequeathing of itself.  The
flower is the end or proper object of the seed, not the seed of the
flower.  The reason for seeds is that flowers may be; not the reason of
flowers that seeds may be.  The flower itself is the creature which the
spirit makes; only, in connection with its perfectness is placed the
giving birth to its successor.

61.  The main fact then, about a flower is that it is part of the plant's
form developed at the moment of its intensest life; and this inner
rapture is usually marked externally for us by the flush of one or more
of the primary colors.  What the character of the flower shall be,
depends entirely upon the portion of the plant into which this rapture of
spirit has been put.  Sometimes the life is put into its outer sheath,
and then the outer sheath becomes white and pure, and full of strength
and grace; sometimes the life is put into the common leaves, just under
the blossom, and they become scarlet or purple; sometimes the life is put
into the stalks of the flower and they flush blue; sometimes into its
outer enclosure or calyx; mostly into its inner cup; but, in all cases,
the presence of the strongest life is asserted by characters in which the
human sight takes pleasure, and which seem prepared with distinct
reference to us, or rather, bear, in being delightful, evidence of having
been produced by the power of the same spirit as our own.

62.  And we are led to feel this still more strongly because all the
distinctions of species,* both in plants and animals, appear to have
similar connection with human character.  Whatever the origin of species
may be, or however those species, once formed, may be influenced by
external accident, the groups into which birth or accident reduce them
have distinct relation to the spirit of man.  It is perfectly possible,
and ultimately conceivable, that the crocodile and the lamb may have
descended from the same ancestral atom of protoplasm; and that the
physical laws of the operation of calcareous slime and of meadow grass,
on that protoplasm, may in time have developed the opposite natures and
aspects of the living frames but the practically important fact for us
is the existence of a power which creates that calcareous earth itself,
--which creates, that separately--and quartz, separately; and gold,
separately; and charcoal, separately; and then so directs the relation
of these elements as that the gold shall destroy the souls of men by
being yellow; and the charcoal destroy their souls by being hard and
bright; and the quartz represent to them an ideal purity; and the
calcareous earth, soft, shall beget crocodiles, and dry and hard, sheep;
and that the aspects and qualities of these two products, crocodiles and
lambs, shall be, the one repellant to the spirit of man, the other
attractive to it, in a quite inevitable way; representing to him states
of moral evil and good; and becoming myths to him of destruction or
redemption, and, in the most literal sense, "words" of God.


* The facts on which I am about to dwell are in nowise antagonistic to
the theories which Mr. Darwin's unwearied and unerring investigations are
every day rendering more probable.  The æsthetic relations of species are
independent of their origin.  Nevertheless, it has always seemed to me
in what little work I have done upon organic forms, as if the species
mocked us by their deliberate imitation of each other when they met; yet
did not pass one into another.


63.  And the force of these facts cannot be escaped from by the thought
that there are species innumerable, passing into each other by regular
gradations, out of which we choose what we must love or dread, and say
they were indeed prepared for us.  Species are not innumerable; neither
are they now connected by consistent gradation.  They touch at certain
points only; and even then are connected, when we examine them deeply,
in a kind of reticulated way, not in chains, but in chequers; also,
however connected, it is but by a touch of the extremities, as it were,
and the characteristic form of the species is entirely individual.  The
rose nearly sinks into a grass in the sanguisorba; but the formative
spirit does not the less clearly separate the ear of wheat from the
dog-rose, and oscillate with tremulous constancy round the central forms
of both, having each their due relation to the mind of man.  The great
animal kingdoms are connected in the same way.  The bird through the
penguin drops towards the fish, and the fish in the cetacean reascends
to the mammal, yet there is no confusion of thought possible between the
perfect forms of an eagle, a trout, and a war-horse, in their relations
to the elements, and to man.

64.  Now we have two orders of animals to take some note of in connection
with Athena, and one vast order of plants, which will illustrate this
matter very sufficiently for us.

The orders of animals are the serpent and the bird: the serpent, in which
the breath or spirit is less than in any other creature, and the
earth-power the greatest; the bird, in which the breath or spirit is more
full than in any other creature, and the earth-power least.

65.  We will take the bird first.  It is little more than a drift of the
air in all its quills, it breathes through its whole frame and flesh and
glows with air in its flying, like blown flames; it rests upon the air,
subdues it, surpasses it, outraces it,--is the air, conscious of itself,
conquering itself, ruling itself.

Also, in the throat of the bird is given the voice of the air.  All that
in the wind itself is weak, wild, useless in sweetness, is knit together
in its song.  As we may imagine the wild form of the bird's wings, so the
wild voice of the cloud into its ordered and commanded voice; unwearied,
rippling through the clear heaven in its gladness, interpreting all
intense passion through the soft spring nights, bursting into acclaim and
rapture of choir at daybreak, or lisping and twittering among the boughs
and hedges through heat of day, like little winds that only make the
cowslip bells shake, and ruffle the petals of the wild rose.

66.  Also, upon the plumes of the bird are put the colors of the air; on
these the gold of the cloud, that cannot be gathered by any covetousness;
the rubies of the clouds, that are not the price of Athena, but are
Athena; the vermillion of the cloud-bar, and the flame of the
cloud-crest, and the snow of the cloud, and its shadow, and the melted
blue of the deep wells of the sky,--all these, seized by the creating
spirit, and woven by Athena herself into films and threads of plume; with
wave on wave following and fading along breast, and throat, and opened
wings, infinite as the dividing of the foam and the sifting of the
sea-sand; even the white down of the cloud seeming to flutter up between
the stronger plumes,--seen, but too soft for touch.

And so the Spirit of the Air is put into, and upon, this created form;
and it becomes, through twenty centuries, the symbol of divine help,
descending, as the Fire, to speak but as the Dove, to bless.

67.  Next, in the serpent we approach the source of a group of myths,
world-wide, founded on great and common human instincts, respecting which
I must note one or two points which bear intimately on all our subject.
For it seems to me that the scholars who are at present occupied in
interpretation of human myths have most of them forgotten that there are
any such thing as natural myths, and that the dark sayings of men may be
both difficult to read, and not always worth reading.  And, indeed, all
guidance to the right sense of the human and variable myths will probably
depend on our first getting at the sense of the natural and invariable
ones.  The dead hieroglyph may have meant this or that; the living
hieroglyph means always the same; but remember, it is just as much a
hieroglyph as the other; nay, more,--a "sacred or reserved sculpture," a
thing with an inner language.  The serpent crest of the king's crown, or
of the god's, on the pillars of Egypt, is a mystery, but the serpent
itself, gliding past the pillar's foot, is it less a mystery?  Is there,
indeed, no tongue, except the mute forked flash from its lips, in that
running brook of horror on the ground?

68.  Why that horror?  We all feel it, yet how imaginative it is, how
disproportioned to the real strength of the creature!  There is more
poison in an ill-kept drain, in a pool of dish-washing at a cottage door,
than in the deadliest asp of Nile.  Every back yard which you look down
into from the railway as it carries you out by Vauxhall or Deptford,
holds its coiled serpent; all the walls of those ghastly suburbs are
enclosures of tank temples for serpent worship; yet you feel no horror in
looking down into them as you would if you saw the livid scales, and
lifted head.  There is more venom, mortal, inevitable, in a single word,
sometimes, or in the gliding entrance of a wordless thought than ever
"vanti Libia con sua rena."  But that horror is of the myth, not of the
creature.  There are myriads lower than this, and more loathsome, in the
scale of being; the links between dead matter and animation drift
everywhere unseen.  But it is the strength of the base element that is so
dreadful in the serpent; it is the very omnipotence of the earth.  That
rivulet of smooth silver, how does it flow, think you?  It literally rows
on the earth, with every scale for an oar; it bites the dust with the
ridges of its body.  Watch it, when it moves slowly.  A wave, but without
wind! a current, but with no fall! all the body moving at the same
instant, yet some of it to one side, some to another, or some forward,
and the rest of the coil backwards, but all with the same calm will and
equal way, no contraction, no extension; one soundless, causeless, march
of sequent rings, and spectral processions of spotted dust, with
dissolution in its fangs, dislocation in its coils.  Startle it, the
winding stream will become a twisted arrow; the wave of poisoned life
will lash through the grass like a cast lance.*  It scarcely breathes
with its one lung (the other shriveled and abortive); it is passive
to the sun and shade, and is cold or hot like a stone; yet "it can
outclimb the monkey, outswim the fish, outleap the zebra, outwrestle the
athlete, and crush the tiger."**  It is a divine hieroglyph of the
demoniac power of the earth, of the entire earthly nature.  As the bird
is the clothed power of the air, so this is the clothed power of the
dust; as the bird is the symbol of the spirit of life, so this is the
grasp and sting of death.


* I cannot understand this swift forward motion of serpents.  The seizure
of prey by the constrictor, though invisibly swift, is quite simple in
mechanism; it is simply the return to its coil of an opened watch-spring,
and is just as instantaneous.  But the steady and continuous motion,
without a visible fulcrum (for the whole body moves at the same instant,
and I have often seen even small snakes glide as fast as I could walk),
seems to involve a vibration of the scales quite too rapid to be
conceived.  The motion of the crest and dorsal fin of the hippocampus,
which is one of the intermediate types between serpent and fish, perhaps
gives some resemblance of it, dimly visible, for the quivering turns the
fin into a mere mist.  The entrance of the two barbs of a bee's sting by
alternate motion, "the teeth of one barb acting as a fulcrum for the
other," must be something like the serpent motion on a small scale.
** Richard Owen.


69.  Hence the continual change in the interpretation put upon it in
various religions.  As the worm of corruption, it is the mightiest of all
adversaries of the gods--the special adversary of their light and
creative power--Python against Apollo.  As the power of the earth against
the air, the giants are serpent-bodied in the Gigantomachia; but as the
power of the earth upon the seed--consuming it into new life ("that which
thou sowest is not quickened except it die")--serpents sustain the
chariot of the spirit of agriculture.

70.  Yet on the other hand, there is a power in the earth to take away
corruption, and to purify (hence the very fact of burial, and many uses
of earth, only lately known): and in this sense the serpent is a healing
spirit,--the representative of Æsculapius, and of Hygieia; and is a
sacred earth-type in the temple of the native earth of Athens; so that
its departure from the temple was a sign to the Athenians that they were
to leave their homes.  And then, lastly, as there is a strength and
healing in the earth, no less than the strength of air, so there is
conceived to be a wisdom of earth no less than a wisdom of the spirit;
and when its deadly power is killed, its guiding power becomes true; so
that the Python serpent is killed at Delphi, where yet the oracle is from
the breath of the earth.

71.  You must remember, however, that in this, as in every other
instance, I take the myth at its central time.  This is only the meaning
of the serpent to the Greek mind which could conceive an Athena.  Its
first meaning to the nascent eyes of men, and its continued influence
over degraded races, are subjects of the most fearful mystery.  Mr.
Fergusson has just collected the principal evidence bearing on the matter
in a work of very great value, and if you read his opening chapters, they
will put  you in possession of the circumstances needing chiefly to be
considered.  I cannot touch upon any of them here, except only to point
out that, though the doctrine of the so-called "corruption of human
nature," asserting that there is nothing but evil in humanity, is just
as blasphemous and false as a doctrine of the corruption of physical
nature would be, asserting there was nothing but evil in the earth,--
there is yet the clearest evidence of a disease, plague, or cretinous
imperfection of development, hitherto allowed to prevail against the
greater part of the races of men; and this in monstrous ways, more full
of mystery than the serpent-being itself.  I have gathered for you
tonight only instances of what is beautiful in Greek religion; but even
in its best time there were deep corruptions in other phases of it, and
degraded forms of many of its deities, all originating in a misunderstood
worship of lower races, little less than these corrupted forms of
devotion can be found, all having a strange and dreadful consistency with
each other, and infecting Christianity, even at its strongest periods,
with fatal terror of doctrine, and ghastliness of symbolic conception,
passing through fear into frenzied grotesque, and thence into sensuality.

In the Psalter of St. Louis itself, half of its letters are twisted
snakes; there is scarcely a wreathed ornament, employed in Christian
dress, or architecture, which cannot be traced back to the serpent's
coil; and there is rarely a piece of monkish decorated writing in the
world that is not tainted with some ill-meant vileness of grotesque,--
nay, the very leaves of the twisted ivy-pattern of the fourteenth century
can be followed back to wreaths for the foreheads of bacchanalian gods.
And truly, it seems to me, as I gather in my mind the evidences of insane
religion, degraded art, merciless war, sullen toil, detestable pleasure,
and vain or vile hope, in which the nations of the world have lived since
first they could bear record of themselves--it seems to me, I say, as if
the race itself were still half-serpent, not extricated yet from its
clay; a lacertine breed of bitterness--the glory of it emaciate with
cruel hunger, and blotted on the leaf a glittering slime, and in the sand
a useless furrow.

72.  There are no myths, therefore, by which the moral state and fineness
of intelligence of different races can be so deeply tried or measured, as
by those of the serpent and the bird; both of them having an especial
relation to the kind of remorse for sin, or for the grief in fate, of
which the national minds that spoke by them had been capable.  The
serpent and vulture are alike emblems of immortality and purification
among races which desired to be immortal and pure; and as they recognize
their own misery, the serpent becomes to them the scourge of the Furies,
and the vulture finds its eternal prey in their breast.  The bird long
contests among the Egyptians with the still received serpent symbol of
power.  But the Draconian image of evil is established in the serpent
Apap; while the bird's wings, with the globe, become part of a better
symbol of deity, and the entire form of the vulture, as an emblem of
purification, is associated with the earliest conception of Athena.  In
the type of the dove with the olive branch, the conception of the spirit
of Athena in renewed life prevailing over ruin is embodied for the whole
of futurity; while the Greeks, to whom, in a happier climate and higher
life than that of Egypt, the vulture symbol of cleansing became
unintelligible, took the eagle instead for their hieroglyph of supreme
spiritual energy, and it thenceforward retains its hold on the human
imagination, till it is established among Christian myths as the
expression of the most exalted form of evangelistic teaching.  The
special relation of Athena to her favorite bird we will trace presently;
the peacock of Hera, and dove of Aphrodite, are comparatively unimportant
myths; but the bird power is soon made entirely human by the Greeks in
their flying angel of victory (partially human, with modified meaning of
evil, in the Harpy and Siren); and thenceforward it associates itself
with the Hebrew cherubim, and has had the most singular influence on the
Christian religion by giving its wings to render the conception of angels
mysterious and untenable, and check rational endeavor to determine the
nature of subordinate spiritual agency; while yet it has given to that
agency a vague poetical influence of the highest value in its own
imaginative way.

73.  But with the early serpent-worship there was associated another,
that of the groves, of which you will also find the evidence exhaustively
collected in Mr. Fergussen's work.  This tree-worship may have taken a
dark form when associated with the Draconian one; or opposed, as in
Judea, to a purer faith; but in itself, I believe, it was always healthy,
and though it retains little definite hieroglyphic power in subsequent
religion, it becomes, instead of symbolic, real; the flowers and trees
are themselves beheld and beloved with a half-worshipping delight, which
is always noble and healthful.

And it is among the most notable indications of the volition of the
animating power that we find the ethical signs of good and evil set on
these also, as well as upon animals; the venom of the serpent, and in
some respects its image also, being associated even with the passionless
growth of the leaf out of the ground; while the distinctions of species
seem appointed with more definite ethical address to the intelligence of
man as their material products become more useful to him.

74.  I can easily show this, and, at the same time, make clear the
relation to other plants of the flowers which especially belong to
Athena, by examining the natural myths in the groups of the plants which
would be used at any country dinner, over which Athena would, in her
simplest household authority, cheerfully rule here in England.  Suppose
Horace's favorite dish of beans, with the bacon; potatoes; some savory
stuffing of onions and herbs, with the meat; celery, and a radish or
two, with the cheese; nuts and apples for desert, and brown bread.

75.  The beans are, from earliest time, the most important and
interesting of the seeds of the great tribe of plants from which came the
Latin and French name for all kitchen vegetables,--things that are
gathered with the hand--podded seeds that cannot be reaped, or beaten, or
shaken down, but must be gathered green.  "Leguminous" plants, all of
them having flowers like butterflies, seeds in (frequently pendent) pods,
--"lætum siliqua quassante legumen"--smooth and tender leaves, divided
into many minor ones; strange adjuncts of tendril, for climbing (and
sometimes of thorn); exquisitely sweet, yet pure scents of blossom, and
almost always harmless, if not serviceable seeds.  It is of all tribes
of plants the most definite, its blossoms being entirely limited in their
parts, and not passing into other forms.  It is also the most usefully
extended in range and scale; familiar in the height of the forest--
acacia, laburnum, Judas-tree; familiar in the sown field--bean and vetch
and pea; familiar in the pasture--in every form of clustered clover and
sweet trefoil tracery; the most entirely serviceable and human of all
orders of plants.

76.  Next, in the potato, we have the scarcely innocent underground stem
of one of a tribe set aside for evil; having the deadly nightshade for
its queen, and including the henbane, the witch's mandrake, and the worst
natural curse of modern civilization--tobacco.*  And the strange thing
about this tribe is, that though thus set aside for evil, they are not a
group distinctly separate from those that are happier in function.  There
is nothing in other tribes of plants like the form of the bean blossom;
but there is another family of forms and structure closely connected with
this venomous one.  Examine the purple and yellow bloom of the common
hedge nightshade; you will find it constructed exactly like some of the
forms of the cyclamen; and, getting this clue, you will find at last the
whole poisonous and terrible group to be--sisters of the primulas!


* It is not easy to estimate the demoralizing effect on the youth of
Europe of the cigar, in enabling them to pass their time happily in
idleness.


The nightshades are, in fact, primroses with a curse upon them; and a
sign set in their petals, by which the deadly and condemned flowers may
always be known from the innocent ones,--that the stamens of the
nightshades are between the lobes, and of the primulas, opposite the
lobes, of the corolla.

77.  Next, side by side, in the celery and radish, you have the two great
groups of unbelled and cruciferous plants; alike in conditions of rank
among herbs: both flowering in clusters; but the unbelled group, flat,
the crucifers, in spires: both of them mean and poor in the blossom, and
losing what beauty they have by too close crowding; both of them having
the most curious influence on human character in the temperate zones of
the earth, from the days of the parsley crown, and hemlock drink, and
mocked Euripidean chervil, until now; but chiefly among the northern
nations, being especially plants that are of some humble beauty, and (the
crucifers) of endless use, when they are chosen and cultivated; but that
run to wild waste, and are the signs of neglected ground, in their rank
or ragged leaves and meagre stalks, and pursed or podded seed clusters.
Capable, even under cultivation, of no perfect beauty, thought reaching
some subdued delightfulness in the lady's smock and the wallflower; for
the most part they have every floral quality meanly, and in vain,--they
are white without purity; golden, without preciousness; redundant,
without richness; divided, without fineness; massive, without strength;
and slender, without grace.  Yet think over that useful vulgarity of
theirs; and of the relations of German and English peasant character to
its food of kraut and cabbage (as of Arab character to its food of
palm-fruit), and you will begin to feel what purposes of the forming
spirit are in these distinctions of species.

78.  Next we take the nuts and apples,--the nuts representing one of the
groups of catkined trees, whose blossoms are only tufts and dust; and the
other, the rose tribe, in which fruit and flower alike have been the
types to the highest races of men, of all passionate temptation, or pure
delight, from the coveting of Eve to the crowing of the Madonna, above
the

            "Rosa sempiterna,
      Che si dilata, rigrada, e ridole
      Odor di lode al Sol."

We have no time now for these, we must go on to the humblest group of
all, yet the most wonderful, that of the grass which has given us our
bread; and from that we will go back to the herbs.

79.  The vast family of plants which, under rain, make the earth green
for man, and, under sunshine, give him bread, and, in their springing in
the early year, mixed with their native flowers, have given us (far more
than the new leaves of trees) the thought and word of "spring," divide
themselves broadly into three great groups--the grasses, sedges, and
rushes.  The grasses are essentially a clothing for healthy and pure
ground, watered by occasional rain, but in itself dry, and fit for all
cultivated pasture and corn.  They are distinctively plants with round
and jointed stems, which have long green flexible leaves, and heads of
seed, independently emerging from them.  The sedges are essentially the
clothing of waste and more or less poor or uncultivated soils, coarse in
their structure, frequently triangular in stem--hence called "acute" by
Virgil--and with their heads of seed not extricated from their leaves.
Now, in both the sedges and grasses, the blossom has a common structure,
though undeveloped in the sedges, but composed always of groups of double
husks, which have mostly a spinous process in the centre, sometimes
projecting into a long awn or beard; this central process being
characteristic also of the ordinary leaves of mosses, as if a moss were
a kind of ear of corn made permanently green on the ground, and with a
new and distinct fructification.  But the rushes differ wholly from the
sedge and grass in their blossom structure.  It is not a dual cluster,
but a twice threefold one, so far separate from the grasses, and so
closely connected with a higher order of plants, that I think you will
find it convenient to group the rushes at once with that higher order,
to which, if you will for the present let me give the general name of
Drosidæ, or dew-plants, it will enable me to say what I have to say of
them much more shortly and clearly.

80.  These Drosidæ, then, are plants delighting in interrupted moisture--
or at certain seasons--into dry ground.  They are not among water-plants,
but the signs of water resting among dry places.  Many of the true
water-plants have triple blossoms, with a small triple calyx holding
them; in the Drosidæ the floral spirit passes into the calyx also, and
the entire flower becomes a six-rayed star, bursting out of the stem
laterally, as if it were the first of flowers and had made its way to the
light by force through the unwilling green.  They are often required to
retain moisture or nourishment for the future blossom through long times
of drought; and this they do in bulbs under ground, of which some become
a rude and simple, but most wholesome, food for man.

81.  So, now, observe, you are to divide the whole family of the herbs of
the field into three great groups,--Drosidæ, Carices,* Gramineæ,--
dew-plants, sedges, and grasses.  Then the Drosidæ are divided into five
great orders: lilies, asphodels, amaryllids, irids, and rushes.  No
tribes of flowers have had so great, so varied, or so healthy an
influence on man as this great group of Drosidæ, depending, not so much
on the whiteness of some of their blossoms, or the radiance of others, as
on the strength and delicacy of the substance of their petals; enabling
them to take forms of faultless elastic curvature, either in cups, as the
crocus, or expanding bells, as the true lily, or heath-like bells, as the
hyacinth, or bright and perfect stars, like the star of Bethlehem, or,
when they are affected by the strange reflex of the serpent nature which
forms the labiate group of all flowers, closing into forms of exquisitely
fantastic symmetry in the gladiolus.  Put by their side their Nereid
sisters, the water-lilies, and you have them in the origin of the
loveliest forms of ornamental design, and the most powerful floral myths
yet recognized among human spirits, born by the streams of Ganges, Nile,
Arno, and Avon.


* I think Carex will be found ultimately better than Cyperus for the
generic name, being the Vergilian word, and representing a larger
sub-species.


82.  For consider a little what each of those five tribes* has been to
the spirit of man.  First, in their nobleness, the lilies gave the lily
of the Annunciation; the asphodels, the flower of the Elysian fields; the
irids, the fleur-de-lys of chivalry; and the amaryllids, Christ's lily of
the field; while the rush, trodden always under foot, became the emblem
of humility.  Then take each of the tribes, and consider the extent of
their lower influence.  Perdita's "The crown imperial, lilies of all
kinds," are the first tribe, which, giving the type of perfect purity in
the Madonna's lily, have, by their lovely form, influenced the entire
decorative design of Italian sacred art; while ornament design of war was
continually enriched by the curves of the triple petals of the Florentine
"giglio," and French fleur-de-lys; so that it is impossible to count
their influence for good in the middle ages, partly as a symbol of
womanly character, and partly of the utmost brightness and refinement of
chivalry in the city which was the flower of cities.


* Take this rough distinction of the four tribes: lilies, superior ovary,
white seeds; asphodels, superior ovary, black seeds; irids, inferior
ovary, style (typically) rising into central crest; amaryllids, inferior
ovary, stamens (typically) joined in central cup.  Then the rushes are a
dark group, through which they stoop to the grasses.


Afterwards, the group of the turban-lilies, or tulips, did some mischief
(their splendid stains having made them the favorite caprice of
florists); but they may be pardoned all such guilt for the pleasure they
have given in cottage gardens, and are yet to give, when lowly life may
again be possible among us; and the crimson bars of the tulips in their
trim beds, with their likeness in crimson bars of morning above them, and
its dew glittering heavy, globed in their glossy cups, may be loved
better than the gray nettles of the ash heap, under gray sky, unveined by
vermilion or by gold.

83.  The next great group, of the asphodels, divides itself also into two
principal families: one, in which the flowers are like stars, and
clustered characteristically in balls, though opening sometimes into
looser heads; and the other, in which the flowers are in long bells,
opening suddenly at the lips, and clustered in spires on a long stem, or
drooping from it, when bent by their weight.

The star-group, of the squills, garlics, and onions, has always caused me
great wonder.  I cannot understand why its beauty, and serviceableness,
should have been associated with the rank scent which has been really
among the most powerful means of degrading peasant life, and separating
it from that of the higher classes.

The belled group, of the hyacinth and convallaria, is as delicate as the
other is coarse; the unspeakable azure light along the ground of the wood
hyacinth in English spring; the grape hyacinth, which is in south France,
as if a cluster of grapes and a hive of honey had been distilled and
compressed together into one small boss of celled and beaded blue; the
lilies of the valley everywhere, in each sweet and wild recess of rocky
lands,--count the influences of these on childish and innocent life; then
measure the mythic power of the hyacinth and asphodel as connected with
Greek thoughts of immortality; finally take their useful and nourishing
power in ancient and modern peasant life, and it will be strange if you
do not feel what fixed relation exists between the agency of the creating
spirit in these, and in us who live by them.

84.  It is impossible to bring into any tenable compass for our present
purpose, even hints of the human influence of the two remaining orders of
Amaryllids and Irids; only note this generally, that while these in
northern countries share with the Primulas the fields of spring, it seems
that in Greece, the primulaceæ are not an extended tribe, while the
crocus, narcissus, and Amaryllis lutea, the "lily of the field" (I
suspect also that the flower whose name we translate "violet" was in
truth an iris) represented to the Greek the first coming of the breath of
life on the renewed herbage; and became in his thoughts the true
embroidery of the saffron robe of Athena.  Later in the year, the
dianthus (which, though belonging to an entirely different race of
plants, has yet a strange look of being made out of the grasses by
turning the sheath-membrane at the root of their leaves into a flower)
seems to scatter, in multitudinous families, its crimson stars far and
wide.  But the golden lily and crocus, together with the asphodel, retain
always the old Greek's fondest thoughts,--they are only "golden" flowers
that are to burn on the trees, and float on the streams of paradise.

85.  I have but one tribe of plants more to note at our country feast--
the savory herbs; but must go a little out of my way to come at them
rightly.  All flowers whose petals are fastened together, and most of
those whose petals are loose, are best thought of first as a kind of cup
or tube opening at the mouth.  Sometimes the opening is gradual, as in
the convolvulus or campanula; oftener there is a distinct change of
direction between the tube and expanding lip, as in the primrose; or even
a contraction under the lip, making the tube into a narrow-necked phial
or vase, as in the heaths; but the general idea of a tube expanding into
a quatrefoil, cinquefoil, or sixfoil, will embrace most of the forms.

86.  Now, it is easy to conceive that flowers of this kind, growing in
close clusters, may, in process of time, have extended their outside
petals rather than the interior ones (as the outer flowers of the
clusters of many umbellifers actually do), and thus elongated and
variously distorted forms have established themselves; then if the stalk
is attached to the side instead of the base of the tube, its base becomes
a spur, and thus all the grotesque forms of the mints, violets, and
larkspurs, gradually might be composed.  But, however this may be, there
is one great tribe of plants separate from the rest, and of which the
influence seems shed upon the rest, in different degrees; and these would
give the impression, not so much of having been developed by change, as
of being stamped with a character of their own, more or less serpentine
or dragon-like.  And I think you will find it convenient to call these
generally Draconidæ; disregarding their present ugly botanical name which
I do not care even to write once--you may take for their principal types
the foxglove, snapdragon, and calceolaria; and you will find they all
agree in a tendency to decorate themselves by spots, and with bosses or
swollen places in their leaves, as if they had been touched by poison.
The spot of the foxglove is especially strange, because it draws the
color out of the tissue all around it, as if it had been stung, and as if
the central color was really an inflamed spot, with paleness round.  Then
also they carry to its extreme the decoration by bulging or pouting out
the petal,--often beautifully used by other flowers in a minor degree,
like the beating out of bosses in hollow silver, as in the kalmia, beaten
out apparently in each petal by the stamens instead of a hammer; or the
borage, pouting towards; but the snapdragons and calceolarias carry it to
its extreme.

87.  Then the spirit of these Draconidæ seems to pass more or less into
other flowers, whose forms are properly pure vases; but it affects some
of them slightly, others not at all.  It never strongly affects the
heaths; never once the roses; but it enters like an evil spirit into the
buttercup, and turns it into a larkspur, with a black, spotted, grotesque
centre, and a strange, broken blue, gorgeous and intense, yet impure,
glittering on the surface as if it were strewn with broken glass, and
stained or darkening irregularly into red.  And then at last the serpent
charm changes the ranunculus into monkshood, and makes it poisonous.  It
enters into the forget-me-not, and the star of heavenly turquoise is
corrupted into the viper's bugloss, darkened with the same strange red as
the larkspur, and fretted into a fringe of thorn; it enters, together
with a strange insect-spirit, into the asphodels, and (though with a
greater interval between the groups) they change to spotted orchideæ; it
touches the poppy, it becomes a fumaria; the iris, and it pouts into a
gladiolus; the lily, and it chequers itself into a snake's-head, and
secretes in the deep of its bell, drops, not of venom indeed, but
honey-dew, as if it were a healing serpent.  For there is an Æsculapian
as well as an evil serpentry among the Draconidæ, and the fairest of
them, the "erba della Madonna" of Venice (Linaria Cymbalaria), descends
from the ruins it delights into the herbage at their feet, and touches
it; and behold, instantly, a vast group of herbs for healing,--all
draconid in form,--spotted and crested, and from their lip-like corollas
named "labiatæ;" full of various balm, and warm strength for healing, yet
all of them without splendid honor or perfect beauty, "ground ives,"
richest when crushed under the foot; the best sweetness and gentle
brightness of the robes of the field,--thyme, and marjoram, and Euphrasy.

88.  And observe, again and again, with respect to all these divisions
and powers of plants: it does not matter in the least by what
concurrences of circumstance or necessity they may gradually have been
developed; the concurrence of circumstance is itself the supreme and
inexplicable fact.  We always come at last to a formative cause, which
directs the circumstance, and mode of meeting it.  If you ask an ordinary
botanist the reason of the form of the leaf, he will tell you that it is
a "developed tubercle," and that its ultimate form "is owing to the
directions of its vascular threads."  But what directs its vascular
threads?  "They are seeking for something they want," he will probably
answer.  What made them want that?  What made them seek for it thus?
Seek for it, in five fibres or in three?  Seek for it, in serration, or
in sweeping curves?  Seek for it, in servile tendrils, or impetuous
spray?  Seek for it, in woolen wrinkles rough with stings, or in glossy
surfaces, green with pure strength, and winterless delight?

89.  There is no answer.  But the sum of all is, that over the entire
surface of the earth, and its waters, as influenced by the power of the
air under solar light, there is developed a series of changing forms, in
clouds, plants, and animals, all of which have reference in their action,
or nature, to the human intelligence that perceives them; and on which,
in their aspects of horror and beauty, and their qualities of good and
evil, there is engraved a series of myths, or words of the forming power,
which, according to the true passion and energy of the human race, they
have been enabled to read into religion.  And this forming power has been
by all nations partly confused with the breath or air through which it
acts, and partly understood as a creative wisdom, proceeding from the
Supreme Deity; but entering into and inspiring all intelligences that
work in harmony with Him.  And whatever intellectual results may be in
modern days obtained by regarding this effluence only as a motion of
vibration, every formative human art hitherto, and the best states of
human happiness and order, may have depended on the apprehension of its
mystery (which is certain,) and of its personality, which is probable.

90.  Of its influence on the formative arts, I have a few words to say
separately: my present business is only to interpret, as we are now
sufficiently enabled to do, the external symbols of the myth under which
it was represented by the Greeks as a goddess of counsel, taken first
into that breast of their supreme Deity, then created out of his
thoughts, and abiding closely beside him; always sharing and consummating
his power.

91.  And in doing this we have first to note the meaning of the principal
epithet applied to Athena, "Glaukopis," "with eyes full of light," the
first syllable being connected, by its root, with words signifying sight,
not with words signifying color.  As far as I can trace the color
perception of the Greeks, I find it all founded primarily on the degree
of connection between color and light; the most important fact to them in
the color of red being its connection with fire and sunshine; so that
"purple" is, in its original sense, "fire-color," and the scarlet or
orange, of dawn, more than any other fire-color.  I was long puzzled by
Homer's calling the sea purple; and misled into thinking he meant the
color of cloud shadows on green sea; whereas he really means the gleaming
blaze of the waves under wide light.  Aristotle's idea (partly true) is
that light, subdued by blackness, becomes red; and blackness, heated or
lighted, also becomes red.  Thus, a color may be called purple because it
is light subdued (and so death is called "purple" or "shadowy" death); or
else it may be called purple as being shade kindled with fire, and thus
said of the lighted sea; or even of the sun itself, when it is thought of
as a red luminary opposed to the whiteness of the moon: "purpureos inter
soles, et candida lunæ sidera;" or of golden hair: "pro purpureo pnam
solvens scelerata capillo;" while both ideas are modified by the
influence of an earlier form of the word, which has nothing to do with
fire at all, but only with mixing or staining; and then, to make the
whole group of thoughts inextricably complex, yet rich and subtle in
proportion to their intricacy, the various rose and crimson colors of the
murex dye,--the crimson and purple of the poppy, and fruit of the palm,--
and the association of all these with the hue of blood,--partly direct,
partly through a confusion between the word signifying "slaughter" and
"palm-fruit color," mingle themselves in, and renew the whole nature of
the old word; so that, in later literature, it means a different color,
or emotion of color, in almost every place where it occurs; and cast
forever around the reflection of all that has been dipped in its dyes.

92.  So that the world is really a liquid prism, and stream of opal.  And
then, last of all, to keep the whole history of it in the fantastic
course of a dream, warped here and there into wild grotesque, we moderns,
who have preferred to rule over coal-mines instead of the sea (and so
have turned the everlasting lamp of Athena into a Davy's safety-lamp in
the hand of Britannia, and Athenian heavenly lightning into British
subterranean "damp"), have actually got our purple out of coal instead of
the sea!  And thus, grotesquely, we have had enforced on us the doubt
that held the old word between blackness and fire, and have completed the
shadow, and the fear of it, by giving it a name from battle, "Magenta."

93.  There is precisely a similar confusion between light and color in
the word used for the blue of the eyes of Athena--a noble confusion,
however, brought about by the intensity of the Greek sense that the
heaven is light, more than it is blue.  I was not thinking of this when I
wrote in speaking of pictorial chiaroscuro, "The sky is not blue color
merely: it is blue fire and cannot be painted" (Mod. P. iv. p. 36); but
it was this that the Greeks chiefly felt of it, and so "Glaukopis"
chiefly means gray-eyed: gray standing for a pale or luminous blue; but
it only means "owl-eyed" in thought of the roundness and expansion, not
from the color; this breath and brightness being, again, in their moral
sense typical of the breadth, intensity, and singleness of the sight in
prudence ("if thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of
light").  Then the actual power of the bird to see in twilight enters
into the type, and perhaps its general fineness of sense.  "Before the
human form was adopted, her (Athena's) proper symbol was the owl, a bird
which seems to surpass all other creatures in acuteness of organic
perception, its eye being calculated to observe objects which to all
others are enveloped in darkness, its ear to hear sounds distinctly, and
its nostrils to discriminate effluvia with such nicety that it has been
deemed prophetic, from discovering the putridity of death even in the
first stages of disease."*


* Payne Knight in his "Inquiry into the Symbolical Language of Ancient
Art," not trustworthy, being little more than a mass of conjectural
memoranda, but the heap is suggestive, if well sifted.


I cannot find anywhere an account of the first known occurrence of the
type; but, in the early ones on Attic coins, the wide round eyes are
clearly the principal things to be made manifest.

94.  There is yet, however, another color of great importance in the
conception of Athena--the dark blue of her ægis.  Just as the blue or
gray of her eyes was conceived more as light than color, so her aegis was
dark blue, because the Greeks thought of this tint more as shade than
color, and, while they used various materials in ornamentation,
lapislazuli, carbonate of copper, or, perhaps, smalt, with real enjoyment
of the blue tint, it was yet in their minds as distinctly representative
of darkness as scarlet was of light, and, therefore, anything dark,* but
especially the color of heavy thunder-cloud, was described by the same
term.  The physical power of this darkness of the ægis, fringed with
lightning, is given quite simply when Jupiter himself uses it to
overshadow Ida and the Plain of Troy, and withdraws it at the prayer of
Ajax for light; and again when he grants it to be worn for a time by
Apollo, who is hidden by its cloud when he strikes down Patroclus; but
its spiritual power is chiefly expressed by a word signifying deeper
shadow,--the gloom of Erebus, or of our evening, which, when spoken of
the ægis, signifies, not merely the indignation of Athena, but the entire
hiding or withdrawal of her help, and beyond even this, her deadliest of
all hostility,--the darkness by which she herself deceives and beguiles
to final ruin those to whom she is wholly adverse; this contradiction of
her own glory being the uttermost judgment upon human falsehood.  Thus it
is she who provokes Pandarus to the treachery which purposed to fulfil
the rape of Helen by the murder of her husband in time of truce; and then
the Greek king, holding his wounded brother's hand, prophesies against
Troy the darkness of the ægis which shall be over all, and for ever.**


* In the breastplate and shield of Atrides the serpents and bosses are
all of this dark color, yet the serpents are said to be like rainbows;
but through all this splendor and opposition of hue, I feel distinctly
that the literal "splendor," with its relative shade, are prevalent in
the conception; and that there is always a tendency to look through the
hue to its cause.  And in this feeling about color the Greeks are
separated from the eastern nations, and from the best designers of
Christian times.  I cannot find that they take pleasure in color for its
own sake; it may be in something more than color, or better; but it is
not in the hue itself.  When Homer describes cloud breaking from a
mountain summit, the crags become visible in light, not color; he feels
only their flashing out in bright edges and trenchant shadows; above, the
"infinite," "unspeakable" æther is torn open--but not the blue of it.  He
has scarcely any abstract pleasure in blue, or green, or gold; but only
in their shade or flame.

I have yet to trace the causes of this (which will be a long task,
belonging to art questions, not to mythological ones); but it is, I
believe, much connected with the brooding of the shadow of death over
the Greeks without any clear hope of immortality.  The restriction of
the color on their vases to dim red (or yellow) with black and white,
is  greatly connected with their sepulchral use, and with all the
melancholy of Greek tragic thought; and in this gloom the failure of
color-perception is partly noble, partly base: noble, in its earnestness,
which raises the design of Greek vases as far above the designing of mere
colorist nations like the Chinese, as men's thoughts are above
children's; and yet it is partly base and earthly, and inherently
defective in one human faculty; and I believe it was one cause of the
perishing of their art so swiftly, for indeed there is no decline so
sudden, or down to such utter loss and ludicrous depravity, as the fall
of Greek design on its vases from the fifth to the third century B.C.  On
the other hand, the pure colored-gift, when employed for pleasure only,
degrades in another direction; so that among the Indians, Chinese, and
Japanese, all intellectual progress in art has been for ages rendered
impossible by the prevalence of that faculty; and yet it is, as I have
said again and again, the spiritual power of art; and its true brightness
is the essential characteristic of all healthy schools.
** 'eremnen Aigida pasi'.--Il. iv. 166.


95.  This, then, finally, was the perfect color-conception of Athena: the
flesh, snow-white (the hands, feet, and face of marble, even when the
statue was hewn roughly in wood); the eyes of keen pale blue, often in
statues represented by jewels; the long robe to the feet, crocus-colored;
and the ægis thrown over it of thunderous purple; the helmet golden (Il.
v. 744.), and I suppose its crest also, as that of Achilles.

If you think carefully of the meaning and character which is now enough
illustrated for you in each of these colors, and remember that the
crocus-color and the purple were both of them developments, in opposite
directions, of the great central idea of fire-color, or scarlet, you will
see that this form of the creative spirit of the earth is conceived as
robed in the blue, and purple, and scarlet, the white, and the gold,
which have been recognized for the sacred chords of colors, from the day
when the cloud descended on a Rock more mighty than Ida.

96.  I have spoken throughout, hitherto, of the conception of Athena, as
it is traceable in the Greek mind; not as it was rendered by Greek art.
It is matter of extreme difficulty, requiring a sympathy at once
affectionate and cautious, and a knowledge reaching the earliest springs
of the religion of many lands, to discern through the imperfection, and,
alas! more dimly yet, through the triumphs of formative art, what kind
of thoughts they were that appointed for it the tasks of its childhood,
and watched by the awakening of its strength.

The religions passion is nearly always vividest when the art is weakest;
and the technical skill only reaches its deliberate splendor when the
ecstacy which gave it birth has passed away forever.  It is as vain an
attempt to reason out the visionary power or guiding influence of Athena
in the Greek heart, from anything we now read, or possess, of the work of
Phidias, as it would be for the disciples of some new religion to infer
the spirit of Christianity from Titian's "Assumption."  The effective
vitality of the religious conception can be traced only through the
efforts of trembling hands, and strange pleasures of untaught eyes; and
the beauty of the dream can no more be found in the first symbols by
which it is expressed, than a child's idea of fairy-land can be gathered
from its pencil scrawl, or a girl's love for her broken doll explained by
the defaced features.  On the other hand, the Athena of Phidias was, in
very fact, not so much the deity, as the darling of the Athenian people.
Her magnificence represented their pride and fondness, more than their
piety; and the great artist, in lavishing upon her dignities which might
be ended abruptly by the pillage they provoked, resigned, apparently
without regret, the awe of her ancient memory; and (with only the
careless remonstrance of a workman too strong to be proud) even the
perfectness of his own art.  Rejoicing in the protection of their
goddess, and in their own hour of glory, the people of Athena robed her,
at their will, with the preciousness of ivory and gems; forgot or denied
the darkness of the breastplate of judgment, and vainly bade its
unappeasable serpents relax their coils in gold.

97.  It will take me many a day yet--if days, many or few, are given me--
to disentangle in anywise the proud and practised disguises of religious
creeds from the instinctive arts which, grotesquely and indecorously, yet
with sincerity, strove to embody them, or to relate.  But I think the
reader, by help even of the imperfect indications already given to him,
will be able to follow, with a continually increasing security, the
vestiges of the Myth of Athena; and to reanimate its almost evanescent
shade, by connecting it with the now recognized facts of existent nature
which it, more or less dimly, reflected and foretold.  I gather these
facts together in brief.

98.  The deep of air that surrounds the earth enters into union with the
earth at its surface, and with its waters, so as to be the apparent cause
of their ascending into life.  First, it warms them, and shades, at once,
staying the heat of the sun's rays in its own body, but warding their
force with its clouds.  It warms and cools at once, with traffic of balm
and frost; so that the white wreaths are withdrawn from the field of the
Swiss peasant by the glow of Libyan rock.  It gives its own strength to
the sea; forms and fills every cell of its foam; sustains the precipices,
and designs the valleys of its waves; gives the gleam to their moving
under the night, and the white fire to their plains under sunrise; lifts
their voices along the rocks, bears above them the spray of birds,
pencils through them the dimpling of unfooted sands.  It gathers out of
them a portion in the hollow of its hand: dyes, with that, the hills into
dark blue, and their glaciers with dying rose; inlays with that, for
sapphire, the dome in which it has to set the cloud; shapes out of that
the heavenly flocks: divides them, numbers, cherishes, bears them on its
bosom, calls them to their journeys, waits by their rest; feeds from them
the brooks that cease not, and strews with them the dews that cease.  It
spins and weaves their fleece into wild tapestry, rends it, and renews;
and flits and flames, and whispers, among the golden threads, thrilling
them with a plectrum of strange fire that traverses them to and fro, and
is enclosed in them like life.

It enters into the surface of the earth, subdues it, and falls together
with it into fruitful dust, from which can be moulded flesh; it joins
itself, in dew, to the substance of adamant, and becomes the green leaf
out of the dry ground; it enters into the separated shapes of the earth
it has tempered, commands the ebb and flow of the current of their life,
fills their limbs with its own lightness, measures their existence by its
indwelling pulse, moulds upon their lips the words by which one soul can
be known to another; is to them the hearing of the ear, and the beating
of the heart; and, passing away, leaves them to the peace that hears and
moves no more.

99.  This was the Athena of the greatest people of the days of old.  And
opposite to the temple of this Spirit of the breath, and life-blood, of
man and beast, stood, on the Mount of Justice, and near the chasm which
was haunted by the goddess-Avengers, an altar to a God unknown,--
proclaimed at last to them, as one who, indeed, gave to all men, life,
and breath, and all things; and rain from heaven, filling their hearts
with rain from heaven, filling their hearts with food and gladness; a God
who had made of one blood all nations of men who dwell on the face of all
the earth, and had determined the times of their fate, and the bounds of
their habitation.

100.  We ourselves, fretted here in our narrow days, know less, perhaps,
in very deed, than they, what manner of spirit we are of, or what manner
of spirit we ignorantly worship.  Have we, indeed, desired the Desire of
all nations? and will the Master whom we meant to seem, and the Messenger
in whom we thought we delighted, confirm, when He comes to His temple,--
or not find in its midst,--the tables heavy with gold for bread, and the
seats that are bought with the price of the dove?  Or is our own land
also to be left by its angered Spirit,--left among those, where sunshine
vainly sweet, and passionate folly of storm, waste themselves in the
silent places of knowledge that has passed away, and of tongues that have
ceased?

This only we may discern assuredly; this, every true light of science,
every mercifully-granted power, every wisely-restricted thought, teach us
more clearly day by day, that in the heavens above, and the earth
beneath, there is one continual and omnipotent presence of help, and of
peace, for all men who know that they live, and remember that they die.




III.

ATHENA ERGANE.*
(Athena in the Heart.)


* "Athena the worker, or having rule over work."  The name was first give
to her by the Athenians.


VARIOUS NOTES RELATING TO THE CONCEPTION OF ATHENA AS THE DIRECTRESS OF
      THE IMAGINATION AND WILL.


101.  I have now only a few words to say, bearing on what seems to me
present need, respecting the third function of Athena, conceived as the
directress of human passion, resolution, and labor.

Few words, for I am not yet prepared to give accurate distinction between
the intellectual rule of Athena and that of the Muses; but, broadly, the
Muses, with their king, preside over meditative, historical, and poetic
arts, whose end is the discovery of light or truth, and the creation of
beauty; but Athena rules over moral passion, and practically useful art.
She does not make men learned, but prudent and subtle; she does not teach
them to make their work beautiful, but to make it right.

In different places of my writings, and though many years of endeavor to
define the laws of art, I have insisted on this rightness in work, and on
its connection with virtue of character, in so many partial ways, that
the impression left on the reader's mind--if, indeed, it was ever
impressed at all--has been confused and uncertain.  In beginning the
series of my corrected works, I wish this principle (in my own mind the
foundation of every other) to be made plain, if nothing else is; and will
try, therefore, to make it so, as far as, by any effort, I can put it
into unmistakable words.  And, at first, here is a very simple statement
of it, given lately in a lecture on the Architecture of the Valley of the
Somme, which will be better read in this place than in its incidental
connection with my account of the porches of Abbeville.

102.  I had used, in a preceding part of the lecture, the expression, "by
what faults" this Gothic architecture fell.  We continually speak thus of
works of art.  We talk of their faults and merits, as of virtues and
vices.  What do we mean by talking of the faults of a picture, or the
merits of a piece of stone?

The faults of a work of art are the faults of its workman, and its
virtues his virtues.

Great art is the expression of the mind of a great man, and mean art,
that of the want of mind of a weak man.  A foolish person builds
foolishly, and a wise one, sensibly; a virtuous one, beautifully; and a
vicious one, basely.  If stone work is well put together, it means that a
thoughtful man planned it, and a careful man cut it, and an honest man
cemented it.  If it has too much ornament, it means that its carver was
too greedy of pleasure; if too little, that he was rude, or insensitive,
or stupid, and the like.  So that when once you have learned how to spell
these most precious of all legends,--pictures and buildings,--you may
read the characters of men, and of nations, in their art, as in a mirror;
nay, as in a microscope, and magnified a hundredfold; for the character
becomes passionate in the art, and intensifies itself in all its noblest
or meanest delights.  Nay, not only as in a microscope, but as under a
scalpel, and in dissection; for a man may hide himself from you, or
misrepresent himself to you every other way; but he cannot in his work:
there, be sure, you have him to the inmost.  All that he likes, all that
he sees,--all that he can do,--his imagination, his affections, his
perseverance, his impatience, his clumsiness, cleverness, everything is
there.  If the work is a cobweb, you know it was made by a spider; if a
honey-comb, by a bee; a wormcast is thrown up by a worm, and a nest
wreathed by a bird; and a house built by a man, worthily, if he is
worthy, and ignobly if he is ignoble.

And always, from the least to the greatest, as the made thing is good or
bad, so is the maker of it.

103.  You will use this faculty of judgment more or less, whether you
theoretically admit the principle or not.  Take that floral gable;* you
don't suppose the man who built Stonehenge could have built that, or that
the man who built that, would have built Stonehenge?  Do you think an old
Roman would have liked such a piece of filigree work? or that Michael
Angelo would have spent his time in twisting these stems of roses in and
out?  Or, of modern handicraftsmen, do you think a burglar, or a brute,
or a pickpocket could have carved it?  Could Bill Sykes have done it? or
the Dodger, dexterous with finger and tool?  You will find in the end,
that no man could have done it but exactly the man who did it; and by
looking close at it, you may, if you know your letters, read precisely
the manner of man he was.


* The elaborate pendiment above the central porch at the west end of
Rouen Cathedral, pierced into a transparent web of tracery, and enriched
with a border of "twisted eglantine."


104.  Now I must insist on this matter, for a grave reason.  Of all facts
concerning art, this is the one most necessary to be known, that, while
manufacture is the work of hands only, art is the work of the whole
spirit of man; and as that spirit is, so is the deed of it; and by
whatever power of vice or virtue any art is produced, the same vice or
virtue it reproduces and teaches.  That which is born of evil begets
evil; and that which is born of valor and honor, teaches valor and honor.
All art is either infection or education.  It must be one or other of
these.

105.  This, I repeat, of all truths respecting art, is the one of which
understanding is the most precious, and denial the most deadly.  And I
assert it the more, because it has of late been repeatedly, expressly,
and with contumely, denied, and that by high authority; and I hold it one
of the most sorrowful facts connected with the decline of the arts among
us, that English gentlemen, of high standing as scholars and artists,
should have been blinded into the acceptance, and betrayed into the
assertion of a fallacy which only authority such as theirs could have
rendered for an instant credible.  For the contrary of it is written in
the history of all great nations; it is the one sentence always inscribed
on the steps of their thrones; the one concordant voice in which they
speak to us out of their dust.

All such nations first manifest themselves as a pure and beautiful animal
race, with intense energy and imagination.  They live lives of hardship
by choice, and by grand instinct of manly discipline; they become fierce
and irresistible soldiers; the nation is always its own army, and their
king, or chief head of government, is always their first soldier.
Pharaoh, or David, or Leonidas, or Valerius, or Barbarossa, or Coeur de
Lion, or St. Louis, or Dandalo, or Frederick the Great,--Egyptian, Jew,
Greek, Roman, German, English, French, Venetian,--that is inviolable law
for them all; their king must be their first soldier, or they cannot be
in progressive power.  Then, after their great military period, comes the
domestic period; in which, without betraying the discipline of war, they
add to their great soldiership the delights and possessions of a delicate
and tender home-life; and then, for all nations, is the time of their
perfect art, which is the fruit, the evidence, the reward of their
national idea of character, developed by the finished care of the
occupations of peace.  That is the history of all true art that ever was,
or can be; palpably the history of it,--unmistakably,--written on the
forehead of it in letters of light,--in tongues of fire, by which the
seal of virtue is branded as deep as ever iron burnt into a convict's
flesh the seal of crime.  But always, hitherto, after the great period,
has followed the day of luxury, and pursuit of the arts for pleasure
only.  And all has so ended.

106.  Thus far of Abbeville building.  Now I have here asserted two
things,--first, the foundation of art in moral character; next, the
foundation of moral character in war.  I must make both these assertions
clearer, and prove them.

First, of the foundation of art in moral character.  Of course art-gift
and amiability of disposition are two different things; for a good man
is not necessarily a painter, nor does an eye for color necessarily imply
an honest mind.  But great art implies the union of both powers; it is
the expression, by an art-gift, of a pure soul.  If the gift is not
there, we can have no art at all; and if the soul--and a right soul too--
is not there, the art is bad, however dexterous.

107.  But also, remember, that the art-gift itself is only the result of
the moral character of generations.  A bad woman may have a sweet voice;
but that sweetness of voice comes of the past morality of her race.  That
she can sing with it at all, she owes to the determination of laws of
music by the morality of the past.  Every act, every impulse, of virtue
and vice, affects in any creature, face, voice, nervous power, and vigor
and harmony of invention, at once.  Perseverance in rightness of human
conduct renders, after a certain number of generations, human art
possible; every sin that clouds it, be it ever so little a one; and
persistent vicious living and following of pleasure render, after a
certain number of generations, all art impossible.  Men are deceived by
the long-suffering of the laws of nature, and mistake, in a nation, the
reward of the virtue of its sires, for the issue of its own sins.  The
time of their visitation will come, and that inevitably; for, it is
always true, that if the fathers have eaten sour grapes, the children's
teeth are set on edge.  And for the individual, as soon as you have
learned to read, you may, as I said, know him to the heart's core,
through his art.  Let his art-gift be never so great, and cultivated to
the height by the schools of a great race of men, and it is still but a
tapestry thrown over his own being and inner soul; and the bearing of it
will show, infallibly, whether it hangs on a man or on a skeleton.  If
you are dim-eyed, you may not see the difference in the fall of the folds
at first, but learn how to look, and the folds themselves will become
transparent, and you shall see through them the death's shape, or the
divine one, making the tissue above it as a cloud of right, or as a
winding-sheet.

108.  Then further, observe, I have said (and you will find it true, and
that to the uttermost) that, as all lovely art is rooted in virtue, so it
bares fruit of virtue, and is didactic in its own nature.  It is often
didactic also in actually expressed thought, as Giotto's, Michael
Angelo's, Dürer's, and hundreds more; but that is not its special
function; it is didactic chiefly by being beautiful; but beautiful with
haunting thought, no less than with form, and full of myths that can be
read only with the heart.

For instance, at this moment there is open beside me as I write, a page
of Persian manuscript, wrought with wreathed azure and gold, and soft
green, and violet, and ruby and scarlet, into one field of pure
resplendence.  It is wrought to delight the eyes only; and does delight
them; and the man who did it assuredly had eyes in his head; but not much
more.  It is not didactic art, but its author was happy; and it will do
the good, and the harm, that mere pleasure can do.  But, opposite me, is
an early Turner drawing of the lake of Geneva, taken about two miles from
Geneva, on the Lausanne road, with Mont Blanc in the distance.  The old
city is seen lying beyond the waveless waters, veiled with a sweet misty
veil of Athena's weaving; a faint light of morning, peaceful exceedingly,
and almost colorless, shed from behind the Voirons, increases into soft
amber along the slope of the Salëve, and is just seen, and no more, on
the fair warm fields of its summit, between the folds of a white cloud
that rests upon the grass, but rises, high and tower-like, into the
zenith of dawn above.

109.  There is not as much color in that low amber light upon the
hillside as there is in the palest dead leaf.  The lake is not blue, but
gray in mist, passing into deep shadow beneath the Voirons' pines; a few
dark clusters of leaves, a single white flower--scarcely seen--are all
the gladness given to the rocks of the shore.  One of the ruby spots of
the eastern manuscript would give color enough for all the red that is in
Turner's entire drawing.  For the mere pleasure of the eye, there is not
so much in all those lines of his, throughout the entire landscape, as in
half an inch square of the Persian's page.  What made him take pleasure
in the low color that is only like the brown of a dead leaf? in the cold
gray of dawn--in the one white flower among the rocks--in these--and no
more than these?

110.  He took pleasure in them because he had been bred among English
fields and hills; because the gentleness of a great race was in his
heart, and its powers of thought in his brain; because he knew the
stories of the Alps, and of the cities at their feet; because he had read
the Homeric legends of the clouds, and beheld the gods of dawn, and the
givers of dew to the fields; because he knew the faces of the crags, and
the imagery of the passionate mountains, as a man knows the face of his
friend; because he had in him the wonder and sorrow concerning life and
death, which are the inheritance of the Gothic soul from the days of its
first sea kings; and also the compassion and the joy that are woven into
the innermost fabric of every great imaginative spirit, born now in
countries that have lived by the Christian faith with any courage or
truth.  And the picture contains also, for us, just this which its maker
had in him to give; and can convey it to us, just so far as we are of the
temper in which it must be received.  It is didactic if we are worthy to
be taught, not otherwise.  The pure heart, it will make more pure; the
thoughtful, more thoughtful.  It has in it no words for the reckless or
the base.

111.  As I myself look at it, there is no fault nor folly of my life--and
both have been many and great--that does not rise up against me, and take
away my joy, and shorten my power of possession of sight, of
understanding.  And every past effort of my life, every gleam of
rightness or good in it, is with me now, to help me in my grasp of this
art, and its vision.  So far as I can rejoice in, or interpret either, my
power is owing to what of right there is in me.  I dare to say it, that,
because through all my life I have desired good, and not evil; because I
have been kind to many; have wished to be kind to all; have wilfully
injured none; and because I have loved much, and not selfishly;
therefore, the morning light is yet visible to me on those hills, and
you, who read, may trust my thought and word in such work as I have to do
for you; and you will be glad afterwards that you have trusted them.

112.  Yet, remember,--I repeat it again and yet again,--that I may for
once, if possible, make this thing assuredly clear: the inherited
art-gift must be there, as well as the life in some poor measure, or
rescued fragment, right.  This art-gift of mine could not have been won
by any work or by any conduct: it belongs to me by birthright, and came
by Athena's will, from the air of English country villages, and Scottish
hills.  I will risk whatever charge of folly may come on me, for printing
one of my many childish rhymes, written on a frosty day in Glen Farg,
just north of Loch Leven.  It bears date 1st January, 1828.  I was born
on the 8th of February, 1819; and al that I ever could be, and all that I
cannot be, the weak little rhyme already shows.

"Papa, how pretty those icicles are,
That are seen so near,--that are seen so far;
--Those dropping waters that come from the rocks
And many a hole, like the haunt of a fox.
That silvery stream that runs babbling along,
Making a murmuring, dancing song.
Those trees that stand waving upon the rock's side,
And men, that, like specters, among them glide.
And waterfalls that are heard from far,
And come in sight when very near.
And the water-wheel that turns slowly round,
Grinding the corn that--requires to be ground,--

(Political Economy of the future!)

----And mountains at a distance seen,
And rivers winding through the plain,
And quarries with their craggy stones,
And the wind among them moans."

So foretelling Stones of Venice, and this essay on Athena.

Enough now concerning myself.

113.  Of Turner's life, and of its good and evil, both great, but the
good immeasurably the greater, his work is in all things a perfect and
transparent evidence.  His biography is simply, "He did this, nor will
ever another do its like again."  Yet read what I have said of him, as
compared with the great Italians, in the passages taken from the "Cestus
of Aglaia," farther on, §158, pp. 164, 165.

114.  This, then, is the nature of the connection between morals and art.
Now, secondly, I have asserted the foundation of both these, at least
hitherto, in war.  The reason of this too manifest fact is, that, until
now it has been impossible for any nation, except a warrior one, to fix
its mind wholly on its men, instead of their possessions.  Every great
soldier nation thinks, necessarily, first of multiplying its bodies and
souls of men, in good temper and strict discipline.  As long as this is
its political aim, it does not matter what it temporarily suffers, or
loses, either in numbers or in wealth; its morality and its arts (if it
have national art-gift) advance together; but so soon as it ceases to be
a warrior nation, it thinks of its possessions instead of its men; and
then the moral and poetic powers vanish together.

115.  It is thus, however, absolutely necessary to the virtue of war that
it should be waged by personal strength, not by money or machinery.  A
nation that fights with a mercenary force, or with torpedoes instead of
its own arms, is dying.  Not but that there is more true courage in
modern than even in ancient war; but this is, first, because all the
remaining life of European nations is with a morbid intensity thrown into
their soldiers; and, secondly, because their present heroism is the
culmination of centuries of inbred and traditional valor, which Athena
taught them by forcing them to govern the foam of the sea-wave and of the
horse,--not the steam of kettles.

116.  And further, note this, which is vital to us in the present crisis:
If war is to be made by money and machinery, the nation which is the
largest and most covetous multitude will win.  You may be as scientific
as you choose; the mob that can pay more for sulphuric acid and gunpowder
will at last poison its bullets, throw acid in your faces, and make an
end of you; of itself, also, in good time, but of you first.  And to the
English people the choice of its fate is very near now.  It may
spasmodically defend its property with iron walls a fathom thick, a few
years longer--a very few.  No walls will defend either it, or its
havings, against the multitude that is breeding and spreading faster than
the clouds, over the habitable earth.  We shall be allowed to live by
small pedler's business, and iron-mongery--since we have chosen those for
our line of life--as long as we are found useful black servants to the
Americans, and are content to dig coals and sit in the cinders; and have
still coals to dig,--they once exhausted, or got cheaper elsewhere, we
shall be abolished.  But if we think more wisely, while there is yet
time, and set our minds again on multiplying Englishmen, and not on
cheapening English wares, if we resolve to submit to wholesome laws of
labor and economy, and setting our political squabbles aside, try how
many strong creatures, friendly and faithful to each other, we can crowd
into every spot of English dominion, neither poison nor iron will prevail
against us; nor traffic, nor hatred; the noble nation will yet, by the
grace of heaven, rule over the ignoble, and force of heart hold its own
against fireballs.

117.  But there is yet a further reason for the dependence of the arts
on war.  The vice and injustice of the world are constantly springing
anew, and are only to be subdued by battle; the keepers of order and law
must always be soldiers.  And now, going back to the myth of Athena, we
see that though she is first a warrior maid, she detests war for its own
sake; she arms Achilles and Ulysses in just quarrels, but she disarms
Ares.  She contends, herself, continually against disorder and
convulsion, in the earth giants; she stands by Hercules' side in victory
over all monstrous evil; in justice only she judges and makes war.  But
in this war of hers she is wholly implacable.  She has little notion of
converting criminals.  There is no faculty of mercy in her when she has
been resisted.  Her word is only, "I will mock when your fear cometh."
Note the words that follow: "when your fear cometh as desolation, and
your destruction as a whirlwind;" for her wrath is of irresistible
tempest: once roused, it is blind and deaf,--rabies--madness of anger--
darkness of the Dies Iræ.

And that is, indeed, the sorrowfullest fact we have to know about our own
several lives.  Wisdom never forgives.  Whatever resistance we have
offered to her loaw, she avenges forever; the lost hour can never be
redeemed, and the accomplished wrong never atoned for.  The best that can
be done afterwards, but for that, had been better; the falsest of all the
cries of peace, where there is no peace, is that of the pardon of sin, as
the mob expect it.  Wisdom can "put away" sin, but she cannot pardon it;
and she is apt, in her haste, to put away the sinner as well, when the
black ægis is on her breast.

118.  And this is also a fact we have to know about our national life,
that it is ended as soon as it has lost the power of noble Anger.  When
it paints over, and apologizes for its pitiful criminalities; and endures
its false weights, and its adulterated food; dares not to decide
practically between good and evil, and can neither honor the one, nor
smite the other, but sneers at the good, as if it were hidden evil, and
consoles the evil with pious sympathy, and conserves it in the sugar of
its leaden heart,--the end is come.

119.  The first sign, then, of Athena's presence with any people is that
they become warriors, and that the chief thought of every man of them is
to stand rightly in his rank, and not fail from his brother's side in
battle.  Wealth, and pleasure, and even love, are all, under Athena's
orders, sacrificed to this duty of standing fast in the rank of war.

But further: Athena presides over industry, as well as battle; typically,
over women's industry; that brings comfort with pleasantness.  Her word
to us all is: "Be well exercised, and rightly clothed.  Clothed, and in
your right minds; not insane and in rags, nor in soiled fine clothes
clutched from each other's shoulders.  Fight and weave.  Then I myself
will answer for the course of the lance, and the colors of the loom."

And now I will ask the reader to look with some care through these
following passages respecting modern multitudes and their occupations,
written long ago, but left in fragmentary form, in which they must now
stay, and be of what use they can.

120.  It is not political economy to put a number of strong men down on
an acre of ground, with no lodging, and nothing to eat.  Nor is it
political economy to build a city on good ground, and fill it with store
of corn and treasure, and put a score of lepers to live in it.  Political
economy creates together the means of life, and the living persons who
are to use them; and of both, the best and the most that it can, but
imperatively the best, not the most.  A few good and healthy men, rather
than a multitude of diseased rogues; and a little real milk and wine
rather than much chalk and petroleum; but the gist of the whole business
is that the men and their property must both be produced together--not
one to the loss of the other.  Property must not be created in lands
desolate by exile of their people, nor multiplied and depraved humanity,
in lands barren of bread.

121.  Nevertheless, though the men and their possessions are to be
increased at the same time, the first object of thought is always to be
the multiplication of a worthy people.  The strength of the nation is in
its multitude, not in its territory; but only in its sound multitude.  It
is one thing, both in a man and a nation, to gain flesh, and another to
be swollen with putrid humors.  Not that multitude ever ought to be
inconsistent with virtue.  Two men should be wiser than one, and two
thousand than two; nor do I know another so gross fallacy in the records
of human stupidity as that excuse for neglect of crime by greatness of
cities.  As if the first purpose of congregation were not to devise laws
and repress crimes!  As if bees and wasps could live honestly in flocks--
men, only in separate dens!  As if it were easy to help one another on
the opposite sides of a mountain, and impossible on the opposite sides of
a street!  But when the men are true and good, and stand shoulder to
shoulder, the strength of any nation is in its quantity of life, not in
its land nor gold.  The more good men a state has, in proportion to its
territory, the stronger the state.  And as it has been the madness of
economists to seek for gold instead of life, so it has been the madness
of kings to seek for land instead of life.  They want the town on the
other side of the river, and seek it at the spear point; it never enters
their stupid heads that to double the honest souls in the town on this
side of the river would make them stronger kings; and that this doubling
might be done by the ploughshare instead of the spear, and through
happiness instead of misery.

Therefore, in brief, this is the only object of all true policy and true
economy: "utmost multitude of good men on every given space of ground"--
imperatively always good, sound, honest men,--not a mob of white-faced
thieves.  So that, on the one hand all aristocracy is wrong which is
inconsistent with numbers; and on the other all numbers are wrong which
are inconsistent with breeding.

122.  Then, touching the accumulation of wealth for the maintenance of
such men, observe, that you must never use the terms "money" and "wealth"
as synonymous.  Wealth consists of the good, and therefore useful, things
in the possession of the nation; money is only the written or coined sign
of the relative quantities of wealth in each person's possession.  All
money is a divisible title-deed, of immense importance as an expression
of right to property, but absolutely valueless as property itself.  Thus,
supposing a nation isolated from all others, the money in its possession
is, at its maximum value, worth all the property of the nation, and no
more, because no more can be got for it.  And the money of all nations
is worth, at its maximum, the property of all nations, and no more, for
no more can be got for it.  Thus, every article of property produced
increases, by its value, the value of all the money in the world, and
every article of property destroyed, diminishes the value of all the
money in the world.  If ten men are cast away on a rock, with a thousand
pounds in their pockets, and there is on the rock, neither food nor
shelter, their money is worth simply nothing, for nothing is to be had
for it.  If they built ten huts, and recover a cask of biscuit from the
wreck, then their thousand pounds, at its maximum value, is worth ten
huts and a cask of biscuit.  If they make their thousand pounds into two
thousand by writing new notes, their two thousand pounds are still worth
ten huts and a cask of biscuit.  And the law of relative value is the
same for all the world, and all the people in it, and all their property,
as for ten men on a rock.  Therefore, money is truly and finally lost in
the degree in which its value is taken from it (ceasing in that degree to
be money at all); and it is truly gained in the degree in which value is
added to it.  Thus, suppose the money coined by the nation be a fixed
sum, and divided very minutely (say into francs and cents), and neither
to be added to nor diminished.  Then every grain of food and inch of
lodging added to its possessions makes every cent in its pockets worth
proportionally more, and every gain of food it consumes, and inch of roof
it allows to fall to ruin, makes every cent in its pockets worth less;
and this with mathematical precision.  The immediate value of the money
at particular times and places depends, indeed, on the humors of the
possessors of property; but the nation is in the one case gradually
getting richer, and will feel the pressure of poverty steadily everywhere
relaxing, whatever the humors of individuals may be; and, in the other
case, is gradually growing poorer, and the pressure of its poverty will
every day tell more and more, in ways that it cannot explain, but will
most bitterly feel.

123.  The actual quantity of money which it coins, in relation to its
real property, is therefore only of consequence for convenience of
exchange; but the proportion in which this quantity of money is divided
among individuals expresses their various rights to greater or less
proportions of the national property, and must not, therefore, be
tampered with.  The government may at any time, with perfect justice,
double its issue of coinage, if it gives every man who has ten pounds in
his pocket another ten pounds, and every man who had ten pence another
ten pence; for it thus does not make any of them richer; it merely
divides their counters for them into twice the number.  But if it gives
the newly-issued coins to other people, or keeps them itself, it simply
robs the former holders to precisely that extent.  This most important
function of money, as a title-deed, on the non-violation of which all
national soundness of commerce and peace of life depend, has been never
rightly distinguished by economists from the quite unimportant function
of money as a means of exchange.  You can exchange goods--at some
inconvenience, indeed, but you can still contrive to do it--without money
at all; but you cannot maintain your claim to the savings of your past
life without a document declaring the amount of them, which the nation
and its government will respect.

124.  And as economists have lost sight of this great function of money
in relation to individual rights, so they have equally lost sight of its
function as a representative of good things.  That, for every good thing
produced, so much money is put into everybody's pocket, is the one simple
and primal truth for the public to know, and for economists to teach.
How many of them have taught it?  Some have; but only incidentally; and
others will say it is a truism.  If it be, do the public know it?  Does
your ordinary English householder know that every costly dinner he gives
has destroyed forever as much money as it is worth?  Does every
well-educated girl--do even the women in high political position--know
that every fine dress they wear themselves, or cause to be worn, destroys
precisely so much of the national money as the labor and material of it
are worth?  If this be a truism, it is one that needs proclaiming
somewhat louder.

125.  That, then, is the relation of money and goods.  So much goods, so
much money; so little goods, so little money.  But, as there is this true
relation between money and "goods," or good things, so there is a false
relation between money and "bads," or bad things.  Many bad things will
fetch a price in exchange; but they do not increase the wealth of the
country.  Good wine is wealth, drugged wine is not; good meat is wealth,
putrid meat is not; good pictures are wealth, bad pictures are not.  A
thing is worth precisely what it can do for you; not what you choose to
pay for it.  You may pay a thousand pounds for a cracked pipkin, if you
please; but you do not by that transaction make the cracked pipkin worth
one that will hold water, nor that, nor any pipkin whatsoever, worth more
than it was before you paid such sum for it.  You may, perhaps, induce
many potters to manufacture fissured pots, and many amateurs of clay to
buy them; but the nation is, through the whole business so encouraged,
rich by the addition to its wealth of so many potsherds,--and there an
end.  The thing is worth what it CAN do for you, not what you think it
can; and most national luxuries, nowadays, are a form of potsherd,
provided for the solace of a self-complacent Job, voluntary sedent on his
ash-heap.

126.  And, also, so far as good things already exist, and have become
media of exchange, the variations in their prices are absolutely
indifferent to the nation.  Whether Mr. A. buys a Titian from Mr. B. for
twenty, or for two thousand, pounds, matters not sixpence to the national
revenue; that is to say, it matters in nowise to the revenue whether Mr.
A. has the picture, and Mr. B. the money, or Mr. B. the picture, and Mr.
A. the money.  Which of them will spend the money most wisely, and which
of them will keep the picture most carefully, is, indeed, a matter of
some importance; but this cannot be known by the mere fact of exchange.

127.  The wealth of a nation then, first, and its peace and well-being
besides, depend on the number of persons it can employ in making good and
useful things.  I say its well-being also, for the character of men
depends more on their occupations than on any teaching we can give them,
or principles with which we can imbue them.  The employment forms the
habits of body and mind, and these are the constitution of the man,--the
greater part of his moral or persistent nature, whatever effort, under
special excitement, he may make to change or overcome them.  Employment
is the half, and the primal half, of education--it is the warp of it; and
the fineness or the endurance of all subsequently woven pattern depends
wholly on its straightness and strength.  And, whatever difficulty there
may be in tracing through past history the remoter connections of event
and cause, one chain of sequence is always clear: the formation, namely,
of the character of nations by their employments, and the determination
of their final fate by their character.  The moment, and the first
direction of decisive revolutions, often depend on accident; but their
persistent course, and their consequences, depend wholly on the nature of
the people.  The passing of the Reform Bill by the late English
Parliament may have been more or less accidental; the results of the
measure now rest on the character of the English people, as it has been
developed by their recent interests, occupations, and habits of life.
Whether, as a body, they employ their new powers for good or evil will
depend, not on their facilities of knowledge, nor even on the general
intelligence they may possess, but on the number of persons among them
whom wholesome employments have rendered familiar with the duties, and
modest in their estimate of the promises, of life.

128.  But especially in framing laws respecting the treatment or
employment of improvident and more or less vicious persons, it is to be
remembered that as men are not made heroes by the performance of an act
of heroism, but must be brave before they can perform it, so they are not
made villains by the commission of a crime, but were villains before they
committed it; and the right of public interference with their conduct
begins when they begin to corrupt themselves,--not merely at the moment
when they have proved themselves hopelessly corrupt.

All measures of reformation are effective in exact proportion to their
timeliness: partial decay may be cut away and cleansed; incipient error
corrected; but there is a point at which corruption can be no more
stayed, nor wandering recalled.  It has been the manner of modern
philanthropy to remain passive until that precise period, and to leave
the sick to perish, and the foolish to stray, while it spends itself in
frantic exertions to raise the dead, and reform the dust.

The recent direction of a great weight of public opinion against capital
punishment is, I trust, the sign of an awakening perception that
punishment is the last and worst instrument in the hands of the
legislator for the prevention of crime.  The true instruments of
reformation are employment and reward; not punishment.  Aid the willing,
honour the virtuous, and compel the idle into occupation, and there will
be no deed for the compelling of any into the great and last indolence of
death.

129.  The beginning of all true reformation among the criminal classes
depends on the establishment of institutions for their active employment,
while their criminality is still unripe, and their feelings of
self-respect, capacities of affection, and sense of justice, not
altogether quenched.  That those who are desirous of employment should
always be able to find it, will hardly, at the present day, be disputed;
but that those who are undesirous of employment should of all persons be
the most strictly compelled to it, the public are hardly yet convinced;
and they must be convinced.  If the danger of the principal thoroughfares
in their capital city, and the multiplication of crimes more ghastly than
ever yet disgraced a nominal civilization, are not enough, they will not
have to wait long before they receive sterner lessons.  For our neglect
of the lower orders has reached a point at which it begins to bear its
necessary fruit, and every day makes the fields, not whiter, but more
stable, to harvest.

130.  The general principles by which employment should be regulated may
be briefly stated as follows:

   I. There being three great classes of mechanical powers at our
disposal, namely, (a) vital or muscular power; (b) natural mechanical
power of wind, water, and electricity; and (c) artificially produced
mechanical power; it is the first principle of economy to use all
available vital power first, then the inexpensive natural forces, and
only at last have recourse to artificial power.  And this because it is
always better for a man to work with his own hands to feed and clothe
himself, than to stand idle while a machine works for him; and if he
cannot by all the labor healthily possible to him feed and clothe
himself, then it is better to use an inexpensive machine--as a windmill
or watermill--than a costly one like a steam-engine, so long as we have
natural force enough at our disposal.  Whereas at present we continually
hear economists regret that the water-power of the cascades or streams of
a country should be lost, but hardly ever that the muscular power of its
idle inhabitants should be lost; and, again, we see vast districts, as
the south of Provence, where a strong wind* blows steadily all day long
for six days out of seven throughout the year, without a windmill, while
men are continually employed at a hundred miles to the north, in digging
fuel to obtain artificial power.  But the principal point of all to be
kept in view is, that in every idle arm and shoulder throughout the
country there is a certain quantity of force, equivalent to the force of
so much fuel; and that it is mere insane waste to dig for coal for our
force, while the vital force is unused, and not only unused, but in being
so, corrupting and polluting itself.  We waste our coal, and spoil our
humanity at one and the same instant.  Therefore, wherever there is an
idle arm, always save coal with it, and the stores of England will last
all the longer.  And precisely the same argument answers the common one
about "taking employment out of the hands of the industrious laborer."
Why, what is "employment" but the putting out of vital force instead of
mechanical force?  We are continually in search of means to pull, to
hammer, to fetch, to carry.  We waste our future resources to get this
strength, while we leave all the living fuel to burn itself out in mere
pestiferous breath, and production of its variously noisome forms of
ashes!  Clearly, if we want fire for force, we want men for force first.
The industrious hands must already have so much to do that they can do
no more, or else we need not use machines to help them.  Then use the
idle hands first.  Instead of dragging petroleum with a steam-engine, put
it on a canal, and drag it with human arms and shoulders.  Petroluem
cannot possibly be in a hurry to arrive anywhere.  We can always order
that, and many other things, time enough before we want it.  So, the
carriage of everything which does not spoil by keeping may most
wholesomely and safely be done by water-traction and sailing-vessels; and
no healthier work can men be put to, nor better discipline, than such
active porterage.


* In order fully to utilize this natural power, we only require machinery
to turn the variable into a constant velocity--no insurmountable
difficulty.


131.  (2d.) In employing all the muscular power at our disposal we are to
make the employments we choose as educational as possible; for a
wholesome human employment is the first and best method of education,
mental as well as bodily.  A man taught to plough, row, or steer well,
and a woman taught to cook properly, and make a dress neatly, are already
educated in many essential moral habits.  Labor considered as a
discipline has hitherto been thought of only for criminals; but the real
and noblest function of labor is to prevent crime, and not to be
Reformatory, but Formatory.

132.  The third great principle of employment is, that whenever there is
pressure of poverty to be met, all enforced occupation should be directed
to the production of useful articles only; that is to say, of food, of
simple clothing, of lodging, or of the means of conveying, distributing,
and preserving these.  It is yet little understood by economists, and not
at all by the public, that the employment of persons in a useless
business cannot relieve ultimate distress.  The money given to employ
riband-makers at Coventry is merely so much money withdrawn from what
would have employed lace-makers at Honiton; or makers of something else,
as useless, elsewhere.  We must spend our money in some way, at some
time, and it cannot at any time be spent without employing somebody.  If
we gamble it away, the person who wins it must spend it; if we lose it in
a railroad speculation, it has gone into some one else's pockets, or
merely gone to pay navies for making a useless embankment, instead of to
pay riband or button makers for making useless ribands or buttons; we
cannot lose it (unless by actually destroying it) without giving
employment of some kind; and, therefore, whatever quantity of money
exists, the relative quantity of employment must some day come out of it;
but the distress of the nation signifies that the employments given have
produced nothing that will support its existence.  Men cannot live on
ribands, or buttons, or velvet, or by going quickly from place to place;
and every coin spent in useless ornament, or useless motion, is so much
withdrawn from the national means of life.  One of the most beautiful
uses of railroads is to enable A to travel from the town of X to take
away the business of B in the town of Y; while, in the mean time, B
travels from the town of Y to take away A's business in the town of X.
But the national wealth is not increased by these operations.  Whereas
every coin spent in cultivating ground, in repairing lodging, in making
necessary and good roads, in preventing danger by sea or land, and in
carriage of food or fuel where they are required, is so much absolute and
direct gain to the whole nation.  To cultivate land round Coventry makes
living easier at Honiton, and every acre of sand gained from the sea in
Lincolnshire, makes life easier all over England.

4th, and lastly.  Since for every idle person some one else must be
working somewhere to provide him with clothes and food, and doing,
therefore, double the quantity of work that would be enough for his own
needs, it is only a matter of pure justice to compel the idle person to
work for his maintenance himself.  The conscription has been used in many
countries to take away laborers who supported their families, from their
useful work, and maintain them for purposes chiefly of military display
at the public expense.  Since this has been long endured by the most
civilized nations, let it not be thought they would not much more gladly
endure a conscription which should seize only the vicious and idle,
already living by criminal procedures at the public expense; and which
should discipline and educate them to labor which would not only maintain
themselves, but be serviceable to the commonwealth.  The question is
simply this: we must feed the drunkard, vagabond, and thief; but shall we
do so by letting them steal their food, and do no work for it? or shall
we give them their food in appointed quantity, and enforce their doing
work which shall be worth it, and which, in process of time, will redeem
their own characters and make them happy and serviceable members of
society?

I find by me a violent little fragment of undelivered lecture, which puts
this, perhaps, still more clearly.  Your idle people (it says), as they
are now, are not merely waste coal-beds.  They are explosive coal-beds,
which you pay a high annual rent for.  You are keeping all these idle
persons, remember, at far greater cost than if they were busy.  Do you
think a vicious person eats less than an honest one? or that it is
cheaper to keep a bad man drunk, than a good man sober?  There is, I
suppose, a dim idea in the mind of the public, that they don't pay for
the maintenance of people they don't employ.  Those staggering rascals
at the street corner, grouped around its splendid angle of public-house,
we fancy that they are no servants of ours! that we pay them no wages!
that no cash out of our pockets is spent over that beer-stained counter!

Whose cash is it then they are spending?  It is not got honestly by work.
You know that much.  Where do they get it from?  Who has paid for their
dinner and their pot?  Those fellows can only live in one of two ways--by
pillage or beggary.  Their annual income by thieving comes out of the
public pocket, you will admit.  They are not cheaply fed, so far as they
are fed by theft.  But the rest of their living--all that they don't
steal--they must beg.  Not with success from you, you think.  Wise, as
benevolent, you never gave a penny in "indiscriminate charity."  Well,
I congratulate you on the freedom of your conscience from that sin, mine
being bitterly burdened with the memory of many a sixpence given to
beggars of whom I knew nothing but that they had pale faces and thin
waists.  But it is not that kind of street beggary that is the worst
beggars' trade.  Home alms which it is their worst degradation to
receive.  Those scamps know well enough that you and your wisdom are
worth nothing to them.  They won't beg of you.  They will beg of their
sisters, and mothers, and wives, and children, and of any one else who is
enough ashamed of being of the same blood with them to pay to keep them
out of sight.  Every one of those blackguards is the bane of a family.
That is the deadly "indiscriminate charity"--the charity which each
household pays to maintain its own private curse.

133.  And you think that is no affair of yours? and that every family
ought to watch over and subdue its own living plague?  Put it to
yourselves this way, then: suppose you knew every one of those families
kept an idol in an inner room--a big-bellied bronze figure, to which
daily sacrifice and oblation was made; at whose feet so much beer and
brandy was poured out every morning on the ground; and before which,
every night, good meat, enough for two men's keep, was set, and left,
till it was putrid, and then carried out and thrown on the dunghill; you
would put an end to that form of idolatry with your best diligence, I
suppose.  You would understand then that the beer, and brandy, and meat,
were wasted; and that the burden imposed by each household on itself lay
heavily through them on the whole community?  But, suppose further, that
this idol were not of silent and quiet bronze only, but an ingenious
mechanism, wound up every morning, to run itself down into automatic
blasphemies; that it struck and tore with its hands the people who set
food before it; that it was anointed with poisonous unguents, and
infected the air for miles round.  You would interfere with the idolatry
then, straightway?  Will you not interfere with it now, when the
infection that they venomous idol spreads is not merely death, but sin?

134.  So far the old lecture.  Returning to cool English, the end of the
matter is, that, sooner or later, we shall have to register our people;
and to know how they live; and to make sure, if they are capable of work,
that right work is given them to do.

The different classes of work for which bodies of men could be
consistently organized, might ultimately become numerous; these following
divisions of occupation may all at once be suggested:

   I.  Road-making.--Good roads to be made, wherever needed, and kept in
repair; and the annual loss on unfrequented roads, in spoiled horses,
strained wheels, and time, done away with.

   II.  Bringing in of waste land.--All waste lands not necessary for
public health, to be made accessible and gradually reclaimed; chiefly our
wide and waste seashores.  Not our mountains nor moorland.  Our life
depends on them, more than on the best arable we have.

   III.  Harbor-making.--The deficiencies of safe or convenient harborage
in our smaller ports to be remedied; other harbors built at dangerous
points of coast, and a disciplined body of men always kept in connection
with the pilot and life-boat services.  There is room for every order of
intelligence in this work, and for a large body of superior officers.

   IV.  Porterage.--All heavy goods, not requiring speed in transit, to
be carried (under preventative duty on transit, by railroad) by
canal-boats, employing men for draught; and the merchant-shipping service
extended by sea; so that no ships may be wrecked for want of hands, while
there are idle ones in mischief on shore.

   V.  Repair of buildings.--A body of men in various trades to be kept
at the disposal of the authorities in every large town, for repair of
buildings, especially the houses of the poorer orders, who, if no such
provision were made, could not employ workmen on their own houses, but
would simply live with rent walls and roofs.

   VI.  Dressmaking.--Substantial dress, of standard material and kind,
strong shoes, and stout bedding, to be manufactured for the poor, so as
to render it unnecessary for them, unless by extremity of improvidence,
to wear cast clothes, or be without sufficiency of clothing.

   VII.  Works of Art.--Schools to be established on thoroughly sound
principles of manufacture, and use of materials, and with sample and, for
given periods, unalterable modes of work; first, in pottery, and
embracing gradually metal work, sculpture, and decorative painting; the
two points insisted upon, in distinction from ordinary commercial
establishments, being perfectness of material to the utmost attainable
degree; and the production of everything by hand-work, for the special
purpose of developing personal power and skill in the workman.

The last two departments, and some subordinate branches of others, would
include the service of women and children.

I give now, for such further illustrations as they contain of the points
I desire most to insist upon with respect both to education and
employment, a portion of the series of notes published some time ago in
the "Art Journal," on the opposition of Modesty and Liberty, and the
unescapable law of wise restraint.  I am sorry that they are written
obscurely--and it may be thought affectedly; but the fact is, I have
always had three different ways of writing: one, with the single view of
making myself understood, in which I necessarily omit a great deal of
what comes into my head; another, in which I say what I think ought to be
said, in what I suppose to be the best words I can find for it (which is
in reality an affected style--be it good or bad); and my third way of
writing is to say all that comes into my head for my own pleasure, in the
first words that come, retouching them afterward into (approximate)
grammar.  These notes for the "Art Journal" were so written; and I like
them myself, of course; but ask the reader's pardon for their
confusedness.

135.  "Sir, it cannot be better done."

We will insist, with the reader's permission, on this comfortful saying
of Albert Dürer's in order to find out, if we may, what Modesty is; which
it will be well for painters, readers, and especially critics, to know,
before going farther.  What it is; or, rather, who she is, her fingers
being among the deftest in laying the ground-threads of Aglaia's cestus.

For this same opinion of Albert's is entertained by many other people
respecting their own doings--a very prevalent opinion, indeed, I find it;
and the answer itself, though rarely made with the Nuremberger's crushing
decision, is nevertheless often enough intimated, with delicacy, by
artists of all countries, in their various dialects.  Neither can it
always be held an entirely modest one, as it assuredly was in the man who
would sometimes estimate a piece of his unconquerable work at only the
worth of a plate of fruit, or a flask of wine--would have taken even one
"fig for it," kindly offered; or given it royally for nothing, to show
his hand to a fellow-king of his own, or any other craft--as Gainsborough
gave the "Boy at the Stile" for a solo on the violin.  An entirely modest
saying, I repeat, in him--not always in us.  For Modesty is "the
measuring virtue," the virtue of modes or limits.  She is, indeed, said
to be only the third or youngest of the children of the cardinal virtue,
Temperance; and apt to be despised, being more given to arithmetic, and
other vulgar studies (Cinderella-like), than her elder sisters; but she
is useful in the household, and arrives at great results with her
yard-measure and slate-pencil--a pretty little Marchande des Modes,
cutting her dress always according to the silk (if this be the proper
feminine reading of "coat according to the cloth"), so that, consulting
with her carefully of a morning, men get to know not only their income,
but their in being--to know themselves, that is, in a gauger's manner,
round, and up and down--surface and contents; what is in them and what
may be got out of them; and in fine, their entire canon of weight and
capacity.  That yard-measure of Modesty's, lent to those who will use it,
is a curious musical reed, and will go round and round waists that are
slender enough, with latent melody in every joint of it, the dark root
only being soundless, moist from the wave wherein

      "Null' altra pianta che facesse fronda
         O che 'n durasse, vi puote aver vita."*


* "Purgatorio," i. 108, 109.


But when the little sister herself takes it in hand, to measure things
outside of us with, the joints shoot out in an amazing manner: the
four-square walls even of celestial cities being measurable enough by
that reed; and the way pointed to them, though only to be followed, or
even seen, in the dim starlight shed down from worlds amidst which there
is no name of Measure any more, though the reality of it always.  For,
indeed, to all true modesty the necessary business is not inlook, but
outlook, and especially uplook: it is only her sister Shamefacedness, who
is known by the drooping lashes--Modesty, quite otherwise, by her large
eyes full of wonder; for she never contemns herself, nor is ashamed of
herself, but forgets herself--at least until she has done something worth
memory.  It is easy to peep and potter about one's own deficiencies in a
quiet immodest discontent; but Modesty is so pleased with other people's
doings, that she has no leisure to lament her own: and thus, knowing the
fresh feeling of contentment, unstained with thought of self, she does
not fear being pleased, when there is cause, with her own rightness, as
with another's, as with another's, saying calmly, "Be it mine or yours,
or whose else's it may, it is no matter; this also is well."  But the
right to say such a thing depends on continual reverence and manifold
sense of failure.  If you have known yourself to have failed, you may
trust, when it comes, the strange consciousness of success; if you have
faithfully loved the noble work of others, you need not fear to speak
with respect of things duly done, of your own.

136.  But the principal good that comes of art being followed in this
reverent feeling is of it.  Men who know their place can take it and
keep it, be it low or high, contentedly and firmly, neither yielding
nor grasping; and the harmony of hand and thought follows, rendering all
great deeds of art possible--deeds in which the souls of men meet like
the jewels in the windows of Aladdin's palace, the little gems and the
large all equally pure, needing no cement but the fitting of facets;
while the associative work of immodest men is all jointless, and astir
with wormy ambition; putridly dissolute, and forever on the crawl: so
that if it come together for a time, it can only be by metamorphosis
through a flash of volcanic fire out of the vale of Siddim, vitrifying
the clay of it, and fastening the slime, only to end in wilder
scattering; according to the fate of those oldest, mightiest, immodestest
of builders, of whom it is told in scorn, "They had brick for stone, and
slime had they for mortar."

137.  The first function of Modesty, then, being this recognition of
place, her second is the recognition of law, and delight in it, for the
sake of law itself, whether her part be to assert it, or obey.  For as it
belongs to all immodesty to defy or deny law, and assert privilege and
license, according to its own pleasure (it being therefore rightly called
"insolent," that is, "custom-breaking," violating some usual and
appointed order to attain for itself greater forwardness or power), so it
is the habit of all modesty to love the constancy and "solemnity," or,
literally, "accustomedness," of law, seeking first what are the solemn,
appointed, inviolable customs and general orders of nature, and of the
Master of nature, touching the matter in hand; and striving to put
itself, as habitually and inviolably, in compliance with them.  Out of
which habit, once established, arises what is rightly called
"conscience," nor "science" merely, but "with-science," a science "with
us," such as only modest creatures can have--with or within them--and
within all creation besides, every member of it, strong or weak,
witnessing together, and joining in the happy consciousness that each
one's work is good; the bee also being profoundly of that opinion; and
the lark; and the swallow, in that noisy, but modestly upside-down, Babel
of hers, under the eaves, with its unvolcanic slime for mortar; and the
two ants who are asking of each other at the turn of that little
ant's-foot-worn bath through the moss "lor via e lor fortuna;" and the
builders also, who built yonder pile of cloud-marble in the west, and the
gilder who gilded it, and is gone down behind it.

138.  But I think we shall better understand what we ought of the nature
of Modesty, and of her opposite, by taking a simple instance of both, in
the practice of that art of music which the wisest have agreed in
thinking the first element of education; only I must ask the reader's
patience with me through a parenthesis.

Among the foremost men whose power has had to assert itself, though with
conquest, yet with countless loss, through peculiarly English
disadvantages of circumstance, are assuredly to be ranked together, both
for honor, and for mourning, Thomas Bewick and George Cruikshank.  There
is, however, less cause for regret in the instance of Bewick.  We may
understand that it was well for us once to see what an entirely keen and
true man's temper, could achieve, together, unhelped, but also unharmed,
among the black bans and wolds of Tyne.  But the genius of Cruikshank has
been cast away in an utterly ghastly and lamentable manner: his superb
line-work, worthy of any class of subject, and his powers of conception
and composition, of which I cannot venture to estimate the range in their
degraded application, having been condemned, by his fate, to be spent
either in rude jesting, or in vain war with conditions of vice too low
alike for record or rebuke, among the dregs of the British populace.  Yet
perhaps I am wrong in regretting even this: it may be an appointed lesson
for futurity, that the art of the best English etcher in the nineteenth
century, spent on illustrations of the lives of burglars and drunkards,
should one day be seen in museums beneath Greek vases fretted with
drawings of the wars of Troy, or side by side with Dürer's "Knight and
Death."

139.  Be that as it may, I am at present glad to be able to refer to one
of these perpetuations, by his strong hand, of such human character as
our faultless British constitution occasionally produces in
out-of-the-way corners.  It is among his illustrations of the Irish
Rebellion, and represents the pillage and destruction of a gentleman's
house by the mob.  They have made a heap in the drawing-room of the
furniture and books, to set first fire to; and are tearing up the floor
for its more easily kindled planks, the less busily-disposed meanwhile
hacking round in rage, with axes, and smashing what they can with
butt-ends of guns.  I do not care to follow with words the ghastly truth
of the picture into its detail; but the most expressive incident of the
whole, and the one immediately to my purpose, is this, that one fellow
has sat himself at the piano, on which, hitting down fiercely with his
clenched fists, he plays, grinning, such tune as may be so producible, to
which melody two of his companions, flourishing knotted sticks, dance,
after their manner, on the top of the instrument.

140.  I think we have in this conception as perfect an instance as we
require of the lowest supposable phase of immodest or licentious art in
music; the "inner consciousness of good" being dim, even in the musician
and his audience, and wholly unsympathized with, and unacknowledged by
the Delphian, Vestal, and all other prophetic and cosmic powers.  This
represented scene came into my mind suddenly one evening, a few weeks
ago, in contrast with another which I was watching in its reality;
namely, a group of gentle school-girls, leaning over Mr. Charles Hallê,
as he was playing a variation on "Home, Sweet Home."  They had sustained
with unwonted courage the glance of subdued indignation with which,
having just closed a rippling melody of Sebastian Bach's (much like what
one might fancy the singing of nightingales would be if they fed on honey
instead of flies), he turned to the slight, popular air.  But they had
their own associations with it, and besought for, and obtained it, and
pressed close, at first, in vain, to see what no glance could follow, the
traversing of the fingers.  They soon thought no more of seeing.  The wet
eyes, round-open, and the little scarlet upper lips, lifted, and drawn
slightly together, in passionate glow of utter wonder, became
picture-like, porcelain-like, in motionless joy, as the sweet multitude
of low notes fell, in their timely infinities, like summer rain.  Only
La Robbia himself (nor even he, unless with tenderer use of color than is
usual in his work) could have rendered some image of that listening.

141.  But if the reader can give due vitality in his fancy to these two
scenes, he will have in them representative types, clear enough for all
future purpose, of the several agencies of debased and perfect art.  And
the interval may easily and continuously be filled by mediate gradations.
Between the entirely immodeset, unmeasured, and (in evil sense)
unmannered, execution with the fist; and the entirely modest, measured,
and (in the noblest sense) mannered, or moral'd execution with the
finger; between the impatient and unpractised doing, containing in itself
the witness of lasting impatience and idleness through all previous life,
and the patient and practised doing, containing in itself the witness
of self-restraint and unwearied toil through all previous life; between
the expressed subject and sentiment of home violation, and the expressed
subject and sentiment of home love; between the sympathy of audience,
given in irreverent and contemptuous rage, joyless as the rabidness of a
dog, and the sympathy of audience given in an almost appalled humility of
intense, rapturous, and yet entirely reasoning and reasonable pleasure;
between these two limits of octave, the reader will find he can class,
according to its modesty, usefulness and grace, or becomingness, all
other musical art.  For although purity of purpose and fineness of
execution by no means go together, degree to degree (since fine, and
indeed all but the finest, work is often spent in the most wanton purpose
--as in all our modern opera--and the rudest execution is again often
joined with purest purpose, as in a mother's song to her child), still
the entire accomplishment of music is only in the union of both.  For the
difference between that "all but" finest and "finest" is an infinite one;
and besides this, however the power of the performer, once attained, may
be afterwards misdirected, in slavery to popular passion or childishness,
and spend itself, at its sweetest, in idle melodies, cold and ephemeral
(like Michael Angelo's snow statue in the other art), or else in vicious
difficulty and miserable noise--crackling of thorns under the pot of
public sensuality--still, the attainment of this power, and the
maintenance of it, involve always in the executant some virtue or courage
of high kind; the understanding of which, and of the difference between
the discipline which develops it and the disorderly efforts of the
amateur, it will be one of our first businesses to estimate rightly.  And
though not indeed by degree to degree, yet in essential relation (as of
winds to waves, the one being always the true cause of the other, though
they are not necessarily of equal force at the same time,) we shall find
vice in its varieties, with art-failure,--and virtue in its varieties,
with art-success,--fall and rise together; the peasant-girl's song at her
spinning-wheel, the peasant laborer's "to the oaks and rills,"--domestic
music, feebly yet sensitively skilful,--music for the multitude, of
beneficent or of traitorous power,--dance-melodies, pure and orderly, or
foul and frantic,--march-music, blatant in mere fever of animal
pugnacity, or majestic with force of national duty and memory,--
song-music, reckless, sensual, sickly, slovenly, forgetful even of the
foolish words it effaces with foolish noise,--or thoughtful, sacred,
healthful, artful, forever sanctifying noble thought with separately
distinguished loveliness of belonging sound,--all these families and
graduations of good or evil, however mingled, follow, in so far as they
are good, one constant law of virtue (or "life-strength," which is the
literal meaning of the word, and its intended one, in wise men's mouths),
and in so far as they are evil, are evil by outlawry and unvirtue, or
death-weakness.  Then, passing wholly beyond the domain of death, we may
still imagine the ascendant nobleness of the art, through all the
concordant life of incorrupt creatures, and a continually deeper harmony
of "puissant words and murmurs made to bless," until we reach

      "The undisturbed song of pure consent,
      Aye sung before the sapphire-colored throne."

142.  And so far as the sister arts can be conceived to have place or
office, their virtues are subject to a law absolutely the same as that of
music, only extending its authority into more various conditions, owing
to the introduction of a distinctly representative and historical power,
which acts under logical as well as mathematical restrictions, and is
capable of endlessly changeful fault, fallacy, and defeat, as well as of
endlessly manifold victory.

143.  Next to Modesty, and her delight in measures, let us reflect a
little on the character of her adversary, the Goddess of Liberty, and her
delight in absence of measures, or in false ones.  It is true that there
are liberties and liberties.  Yonder torrent, crystal-clear, and
arrow-swift, with its spray leaping into the air like white troops of
fawns, is free enough.  Lost, presently, amidst bankless, boundless marsh
--soaking in slow shallowness, as it will, hither and thither, listless
among the poisonous reeds and unresisting slime--it is free also.  We may
choose which liberty we like,--the restraint of voiceful rock, or the
dumb and edgeless shore of darkened sand.  Of that evil liberty which men
are now glorifying and proclaiming as essence of gospel to all the earth,
and will presently, I suppose, proclaim also to the stars, with
invitation to them out of their courses,--and of its opposite continence,
which is the clasp and 'chrusee perone' of Aglaia's cestus, we must try
to find out something true.  For no quality of Art has been more powerful
in its influence on public mind; none is more frequently the subject of
popular praise, or the end of vulgar effort, than what we call "Freedom."
It is necessary to determine the justice or injustice of this popular
praise.

144.  I said, a little while ago, that the practical teaching of the
masters of Art was summed by the O of Giotto.  "You may judge my
masterhood of craft," Giotto tells us, "by seeing that I can draw a
circle unerringly."  And we may safely believe him, understanding him to
mean that, though more may be necessary to an artist than such a power,
at least this power is necessary.  The qualities of hand and eye needful
to do this are the first conditions of artistic craft.

145.  Try to draw a circle yourself with the "free" hand, and with a
single line.  You cannot do it if your hand trembles, nor if it is in the
common sense of the word "free."  So far from being free, it must be as
if it were fastened to an inflexible bar of steel.  And yet it must move,
under this necessary control, with perfect, untormented serenity of ease.

146.  That is the condition of all good work whatsoever.  All freedom is
error.  Every line you lay down is either right or wrong; it may be
timidly and awkwardly wrong, or fearlessly and impudently wrong.  The
aspect of the impudent wrongness is pleasurable to vulgar persons, and is
what they commonly call "free" execution; the timid, tottering,
hesitating wrongness is rarely so attractive; yet sometimes, if
accompanied with good qualities, and right aims in other directions, it
becomes in a manner charming, like the inarticulateness of a child; but,
whatever the charm or manner of the error, there is but one question
ultimately to be asked respecting every line you draw, Is it right or
wrong?  If right, it most assuredly is not a "free" line, but an
intensely continent, restrained, and considered line; and the action of
the hand in laying it is just as decisive, and just as "free," as the
hand of a first-rate surgeon in a critical incision.  A great operator
told me that his hand could check itself within about the two-hundredth
of an inch, in penetrating a membrane; and this, of course, without the
help of sight, by sensation only.  With help of sight, and in action on a
substance which does not quiver or yield, a fine artist's line is
measurable in its proposed direction to considerably less than the
thousandth of an inch.

A wide freedom, truly!

147.  The conditions of popular art which most foster the common ideas
about freedom, are merely results of irregularly energetic effort by men
imperfectly educated; these conditions being variously mingled with
cruder mannerisms resulting from timidity, or actual imperfection of
body.  Northern hands and eyes are, of course, never so subtle as
Southern; and in very cold countries, artistic execution is palsied.  The
effort to break through this timidity, or to refine the bluntness, may
lead to a licentious impetuosity, or an ostentatious minuteness.  Every
man's manner has this kind of relation to some defect in his physical
powers or modes of thought; so that in the greatest work there is no
manner visible.  It is at first uninteresting from its quietness; the
majesty of restrained power only dawns gradually upon us, as we walk
towards its horizon.

There is, indeed, often great delightfulness in the innocent manners of
artists who have real power and honesty, and draw in this way or that, as
best they can, under such and such untoward circumstances of life.  But
the greater part of the looseness, flimsiness, or audacity of modern work
is the expression of an inner spirit of license in mind and heart,
connected, as I said, with the peculiar folly of this age, its hope of,
and trust in, "liberty," of which we must reason a little in more general
terms.

148.  I believe we can nowhere find a better type of a perfectly free
creature than in the common house-fly.  Nor free only, but brave; and
irreverent to a degree which I think no human republican could by any
philosophy exalt himself to.  There is no courtesy in him; he does not
care whether it is king or clown whom he teases; and in every step of his
swift mechanical march, and in every pause of his resolute observation,
there is one and the same expression of perfect egotism, perfect
independence and self-confidence, and conviction of the world's having
been made for flies.  Strike at him with your hand, and to him, the
mechanical fact and external aspect of the matter is, what to you it
would be if an acre of red clay, ten feet thick, tore itself up from the
ground in one massive field, hovered over you in the air for a second,
and came crashing down with an aim.  That is the external aspect of it;
the inner aspect, to his fly's mind, is of a quite natural and
unimportant occurrence--one of the momentary conditions of his active
life.  He steps out of the way of your hand, and alights on the back of
it.  You cannot terrify him, nor govern him, nor persuade him, nor
convince him.  He has his own positive opinion on all matters; not an
unwise one, usually, for his own ends; and will ask no advice of yours.
He has no work to do--no tyrannical instinct to obey.  The earthworm has
his digging; the bee her gathering and building; the spider her cunning
network; the ant her treasury and accounts.  All these are comparatively
slaves, or people of vulgar business.  But your fly, free in the air,
free in the chamber--a black incarnation of caprice, wandering,
investigating, flitting, flirting, feasting at his will, with rich
variety of choice in feast, from the heaped sweets in the grocer's window
to those of the butcher's back-yard, and from the galled place on your
cab-horse's back, to the brown spot in the road, from which, as the hoof
disturbs him, he rises with angry republican buzz--what freedom is like
his?

149.  For captivity, again, perhaps your poor watch-dog is as sorrowful
a type as you will easily find.  Mine certainly is.  The day is lovely,
but I must write this, and cannot go out with him.  He is chained in the
yard because I do not like dogs in rooms, and the gardener does not like
dogs in gardens.  He has no books,--nothing but his own weary thoughts
for company, and a group of those free flies, whom he snaps at, with
sullen ill success.  Such dim hope as he may have that I may take him out
with me, will be, hour by hour, wearily disappointed; or, worse, darkened
at once into a leaden despair by an authoritative "No"--too well
understood.  His fidelity only seals his fate; if he would not watch for
me, he would be sent away, and go hunting with some happier master: but
he watches, and is wise, and faithful, and miserable; and his high animal
intellect only gives him the wistful powers of wonder, and sorrow, and
desire, and affection, which embitter his captivity.  Yet of the two,
would we rather be watch-dog or fly?

150.  Indeed, the first point we have all to determine is not how free
we are, but what kind of creatures we are.  It is of small importance to
any of us whether we get liberty; but of the greatest that we deserve it.
Whether we can win it, fate must determine; but that we will be worthy of
it we may ourselves determine; and the sorrowfullest fate of all that we
can suffer is to have it without deserving it.

151.  I have hardly patience to hold my pen and go on writing, as I
remember (I would that it were possible for a few consecutive instants to
forget) the infinite follies of modern thought in this matter, centred in
the notion that liberty is good for a man, irrespectively of the use he
is likely to make of it.  Folly unfathomable! unspeakable! unendurable to
look in the full face of, as the laugh of a cretin.  You will send your
child, will you, into a room where the table is loaded with sweet wine
and fruit--some poisoned, some not?--you will say to him, "Choose freely,
my little child!  It is so good for you to have freedom of choice; it
forms your character--your individuality!  If you take the wrong cup or
the wrong berry, you will die before the day is over, but you will have
acquired the dignity of a Free child?"

152.  You think that puts the case too sharply?  I tell you, lover of
liberty, there is no choice offered to you, but it is similarly between
life and death.  There is no act, nor option of act, possible, but the
wrong deed or option has poison in it which will stay in your veins
thereafter forever.  Never more to all eternity can you be as you might
have been had you not done that--chosen that.  You have "formed your
character," forsooth!  No; if you have chosen ill, you have De-formed
it, and that for ever!  In some choices it had been better for you that
a red-hot iron bar struck you aside, scarred and helpless, than that you
had so chosen.  "You will know better next time!"  No.  Next time will
never come.  Next time the choice will be in quite another aspect--
between quite different things,--you, weaker than you were by the evil
into which you have fallen; it, more doubtful than it was, by the
increased dimness of your sight.  No one ever gets wiser by doing wrong,
nor stronger.  You will get wiser and stronger only by doing right,
whether forced or not; the prime, the one need is to do that, under
whatever compulsion, until you can do it without compulsion.  And then
you are a Man.

153.  "What!" a wayward youth might perhaps answer, incredulously, "no
one ever gets wiser by doing wrong?  Shall I not know the world best by
trying the wrong of it, and repenting?  Have I not, even as it is,
learned much by many of my errors?"  Indeed, the effort by which
partially you recovered yourself was precious; that part of your thought
by which you discerned the error was precious.  What wisdom and strength
you kept, and rightly used, are rewarded; and in the pain and the
repentance, and in the acquaintance with the aspects of folly and sin,
you have learned something; how much less than you would have learned in
right paths can never be told, but that it is less is certain.  Your
liberty of choice has simply destroyed for you so much life and strength
never regainable.  It is true, you now know the habits of swine, and the
taste of husks; do you think your father could not have taught you to
know better habits and pleasanter tastes, if you had stayed in his house;
and that the knowledge you have lost would not have been more, as well as
sweeter, than that you have gained?  But "it so forms my individuality
to be free!"  Your individuality was given you by God, and in your race,
and if you have any to speak of, you will want no liberty.  You will want
a den to work in, and peace, and light--no more,--in absolute need; if
more, in anywise, it will still not be liberty, but direction,
instruction, reproof, and sympathy.  But if you have no individuality, if
there is no true character nor true desire in you, then you will indeed
want to be free.  You will begin early, and, as a boy, desire to be a
man; and, as a man, think yourself as good as every other.  You will
choose freely to eat, freely to drink, freely to stagger and fall,
freely, at last, to curse yourself and die.  Death is the only real
freedom possible to us; and that is consummate freedom, permission for
every particle in the rotting body to leave its neighbor particle, and
shift for itself.  You call it "corruption" in the flesh; but before it
comes to that, all liberty is an equal corruption in mind.  You ask for
freedom of thought; but if you have not sufficient grounds for thought,
you have no business to think; and if you have sufficient grounds, you
have no business to think wrong.  Only one thought is possible to you if
you are wise--your liberty is geometrically proportionate to your folly.

154.  "But all this glory and activity of our age; what are they owing
to, but to freedom of thought?"  In a measure, they are owing--what good
is in them--to the discovery of many lies, and the escape from the power
of evil.  Not to liberty, but to the deliverance from evil or cruel
masters.  Brave men have dared to examine lies which had long been
taught, not because they were free-thinkers, but because they were such
stern and close thinkers that the lie could no longer escape them.  Of
course the restriction of thought, or of its expression, by persecution,
is merely a form of violence, justifiable or not, as other violence is,
according to the character of the persons against whom it is exercised,
and the divine and eternal laws which it vindicates or violates.  We must
not burn a man alive for saying that the Athanasian creed is
ungrammatical, nor stop a bishop's salary because we are getting the
worst of an argument with him; neither must we let drunken men howl in
the public streets at night.  There is much that is true in the part of
Mr. Mill's essay on Liberty which treats of freedom of thought; some
important truths are there beautifully expressed, but many, quite vital,
are omitted; and the balance, therefore, is wrongly struck.  The liberty
of expression, with a great nation, would become like that in a
well-educated company, in which there is indeed freedom of speech, but
not of clamor; or like that in an orderly senate, in which men who
deserve to be heard, are heard in due time, and under determined
restrictions.  The degree of liberty you can rightly grant to a number
of men is in the inverse ratio of their desire for it; and a general
hush, or call to order, would be often very desirable in this England of
ours.  For the rest, of any good or evil extent, it is impossible to say
what measure is owing to restraint, and what to license where the right
is balanced between them.  I was not a little provoked one day, a summer
or two since, in Scotland, because the Duke of Athol hindered me from
examining the gneiss and slate junctions in Glen Tilt, at the hour
convenient to me; but I saw them at last, and in quietness; and to the
very restriction that annoyed me, owed, probably, the fact of their being
in existence, instead of being blasted away by a mob-company; while the
"free" paths and inlets of Loch Katrine and the Lake of Geneva are
forever trampled down and destroyed, not by one duke, but by tens of
thousands of ignorant tyrants.

155.  So, a Dean and Chapter may, perhaps, unjustifiably charge me
twopence for seeing a cathedral; but your free mob pulls spire and all
down about my ears, and I can see it no more forever.  And even if I
cannot get up to the granite junctions in the glen, the stream comes down
from them pure to the Garry; but in Beddington Park I am stopped by the
newly-erected fence of a building speculator; and the bright Wandel,
divine of waters as Castaly, is filled by the free public with old shoes,
obscene crockery, and ashes.

156.  In fine, the arguments for liberty may in general be summed in a
few very simple forms, as follows:

Misguiding is mischievous: therefore guiding is.

If the blind lead the blind, both fall into the ditch: therefore, nobody
should lead anybody.

Lambs and fawns should be left free in the fields; much more bears and
wolves.

If a man's gun and shot are his own, he may fire in any direction he
pleases.

A fence across a road is inconvenient; much more one at the side of it.

Babes should not be swaddled with their hands bound down to their sides:
therefore they should be thrown out to roll in the kennels naked.

None of these arguments are good, and the practical issues of them are
worse.  For there are certain eternal laws for human conduct which are
quite clearly discernible by human reason.  So far as these are
discovered and obeyed, by whatever machinery or authority the obedience
is procured, there follow life and strength.  So far as they are
disobeyed, by whatever good intention the disobedience is brought about,
there follow ruin and sorrow.  And the first duty of every man in the
world is to find his true master, and, for his own good, submit to him;
and to find his true inferior, and, for that inferior's good, conquer
him.  The punishment is sure, if we either refuse the reverence, or are
too cowardly and indolent to enforce the compulsion.  A base nation
crucifies or poisons its wise men, and lets its fools rave and rot in the
streets.  A wise nation obeys the one, restrains the other, and cherishes
all.

157.  The best examples of the results of wise normal evidence in Art
will be found in whatever evidence remains respecting the lives of great
Italian painters, though, unhappily, in eras of progress, but just in
proportion to the admirableness and efficiency of the life, will be
usually the scantiness of its history.  The individualities and liberties
which are causes of destruction may be recorded; but the loyal conditions
of daily breath are never told.  Because Leonardo made models of
machines, dug canals, built fortifications, and dissipated half his
art-power in capricious ingenuities, we have many anecdotes of him;--but
no picture of importance on canvas, and only a few withered stains of one
upon a wall.  But because his pupil, or reputed pupil, Luini, labored in
constant and successful simplicity, we have no anecdotes of him;--only
hundreds of noble works.  Luini is, perhaps, the best central type of the
highly-trained Italian painter.  He is the only man who entirely united
the religious temper which was the spirit-life of art, with the physical
power which was its bodily life.  He joins the purity and passion of
Angelico to the strength of Veronese: the two elements, poised in perfect
balance, are so calmed and restrained, each by the other, that most of us
lose the sense of both.  The artist does not see the strength, by reason
of the chastened spirit in which it is used: and the religious visionary
does not recognize the passion, by reason of the frank human truth with
which it is rendered.  He is a man ten times greater than Leonardo;--a
mighty colorist, while Leonardo was only a fine draughtsman in black,
staining the chiaroscuro drawing, like a colored print: he perceived and
rendered the delicatest types of human beauty that have been painted
since the days of the Greeks, while Leonardo depraved his finer instincts
by caricature, and remained to the end of his days the slave of an
archaic smile: and he is a designer as frank, instinctive, and
exhaustless as Tintoret, while Leonardo's design is only an agony of
science, admired chiefly because it is painful, and capable of analysis
in its best accomplishment.  Luini has left nothing behind him that is
not lovely; but of his life I believe hardly anything is known beyond
remnants of tradition which murmur about Lugano and Saronno, and which
remain ungleaned.  This only is certain, that he was born in the
loveliest district of North Italy, where hills, and streams, and air
meet in softest harmonies.  Child of the Alps, and of their divinest
lake, he is taught, without doubt or dismay, a lofty religious creed, and
a sufficient law of life, and of its mechanical arts.  Whether lessoned
by Leonardo himself, or merely one of many disciplined in the system of
the Milanese school, he learns unerringly to draw, unerringly and
enduringly to paint.  His tasks are set him without question day by day,
by men who are justly satisfied with his work, and who accept it without
any harmful praise, or senseless blame.  Place, scale, and subject are
determined for him on the cloister wall or the church dome; as he is
required, and for sufficient daily bread, and little more, he paints what
he has been taught to design wisely, and has passion to realize
gloriously: every touch he lays is eternal, every thought he conceives is
beautiful and pure: his hand moves always in radiance of blessing; from
day to day his life enlarges in power and peace; it passes away
cloudlessly, the starry twilight remaining arched far against the night.

158.  Oppose to such a life as this that of a great painter amidst the
elements of modern English liberty.  Take the life of Turner, in whom the
artistic energy and inherent love of beauty were at least as strong as in
Luini: but, amidst the disorder and ghastliness of the lower streets of
London, his instincts in early infancy were warped into toleration of
evil, or even into delight in it.  He gathers what he can of instruction
by questioning and prying among half-informed masters; spells out some
knowledge of classical fable; educates himself, by an admirable force, to
the production of wildly majestic or pathetically tender and pure
pictures, by which he cannot live.  There is no one to judge them, or to
command him: only some of the English upper classes hire him to paint
their houses and parks, and destroy the drawings afterwards by the most
wanton neglect.  Tired of laboring carefully, without either reward or
praise, he dashes out into various experimental and popular works--makes
himself the servant of the lower public, and is dragged hither and
thither at their will; while yet, helpless and guideless, he indulges his
idiosyncrasies till they change into insanities; the strength of his soul
increasing its sufferings, and giving force to its errors; all the
purpose of life degenerating into instinct; and the web of his work
wrought, at last, of beauties too subtle to be understood, his liberty,
with vices too singular to be forgiven--all useless, because magnificent
idiosyncrasy had become solitude, or contention, in the midst of a
reckless populace, instead of submitting itself in loyal harmony to the
Art-laws of an understanding nation.  And the life passed away in
darkness; and its final work, in all the best beauty of it, has already
perished, only enough remaining to teach us what we have lost.

159.  These are the opposite effects of Law and of Liberty on men of the
highest powers.  In the case of inferiors the contrast is still more
fatal: under strict law, they become the subordinate workers in great
schools, healthily aiding, echoing, or supplying, with multitudinous
force of hand, the mind of the leading masters: they are the nameless
carvers of great architecture--stainers of glass--hammerers of iron--
helpful scholars, whose work ranks round, if not with, their master's,
and never disgraces it.  But the inferiors under a system of license
for the most part perish in miserable effort;* a few struggle into
pernicious eminence--harmful alike to themselves and to all who admire
them; many die of starvation; many insane, either in weakness of insolent
egotism, like Haydon, or in a conscientious agony of beautiful purpose
and warped power, like Blake.  There is no probability of the persistence
of a licentious school in any good accidentally discovered by them; there
is an approximate certainty of their gathering, with acclaim, round any
shadow of evil, and following it to whatever quarter of destruction it
may lead.


* As I correct this sheet for press, my "Pall Mall Gazette" of last
Saturday, April 17, is lying on the table by me.  I print a few lines out
of it:

   "AN ARTIST'S DEATH.--A sad story was told at an inquest held in St.
Pancras last night by Dr. Lankester on the body of . . ., aged
fifty-nine, a French artist who was found dead in his bed at his rooms in
. . . Street.  M. . . ., also an artist, said he had known the deceased
for fifteen years.  He once held a high position, and being anxious to
make a name in the world, he five years ago commenced a large picture,
which he hoped, when completed, to have in the gallery at Versailles; and
with that view he sent a photograph of it to the French Emperor.  He also
had an idea of sending it to the English Royal Academy.  He labored on
this picture, neglecting other work which would have paid him well, and
gradually sank lower and lower into poverty.  His friends assisted him,
but being absorbed in his great work, he did not heed their advice, and
they left him.  He was, however, assisted by the French Ambassador, and
last Saturday, he (the witness) saw deceased, who was much depressed in
spirits, as he expected the brokers to be put in possession for rent.  He
said his troubles were so great that he feared his brain would give way.
The witness gave him a shilling for which he appeared very thankful.  On
Monday the witness called upon him, but received no answer to his knock.
He went again on Tuesday, and entered the deceased's bedroom and found
him dead.  Dr. George Ross said that when called into the deceased he had
been dead at least two days.  The room was in a filthy, dirty condition,
and the picture referred to--certainly a very fine one--was in that room.
The post-mortem examination showed that the cause of death was fatty
degeneration of the heart, the latter probably having ceased its action
through the mental excitement of the deceased."


160.  Thus far the notes of Freedom.  Now, lastly, here is some talk
which I tried at the time to make intelligible; and with which I close
this volume, because it will serve sufficiently to express the practical
relation in which I think the art and imagination of the Greeks stand to
our own; and will show the reader that my view of that relation is
unchanged, from the first day on which I began to write, until now.

THE HERCULES OF CAMARINA.

ADDRESS TO THE STUDENTS OF THE ART SCHOOL OF SOUTH LAMBERT, MARCH 15,
1869.


161.  Among the photographers of Greek coins which present so many
admirable subjects for your study, I must speak for the present of one
only: the Hercules of Camarina.  You have, represented by a Greek
workman, in that coin, the face of a man and the skin of a lion's head.
And the man's face is like a man's face, but the lion's skin is not like
a lion's skin.

162.  Now there are some people who will tell you that Greek art is fine,
because it is true; and because it carves men's faces as like men's as it
can.

And there are other people who will tell you that Greek art is fine,
because it is not true; and carves a lion's skin so as to look not at all
like a lion's skin.

And you fancy that one or the other of these sets of people must be
wrong, and are perhaps much puzzled to find out which you should believe.

But neither of them are wrong, and you will have eventually to believe,
or rather to understand and know, in reconciliation, the truths taught by
each; but for the present, the teachers of the first group are those you
must follow.

It is they who tell you the deepest and usefullest truth, which involves
all others in time.  Greek art, and all other art, is fine when it makes
a man's face as like a man's face as it can.  Hold to that.  All kinds of
nonsense are talked to you, nowadays, ingeniously and irrelevantly about
art.  Therefore, for the most part of the day, shut your ears, and keep
your eyes open: and understand primarily, what you may, I fancy, easily
understand, that the greatest masters of all greatest schools--Phidias,
Donatello, Titian, Velasquez, or Sir Joshua Reynolds--all tried to make
human creatures as like human creatures as they could; and that anything
less like humanity than their work, is not so good as theirs.

Get that well driven into your heads; and don't let it out again, at your
peril.

163.  Having got it well in, you may then further understand, safely,
that three is a great deal of secondary work in pots, and pans, and
floors, and carpets, and shawls, and architectural ornament, which ought
essentially, to be unlike reality, and to depend for its charm on quite
other qualities than imitative ones.  But all such art is inferior and
secondary--much of it more or less instinctive and animal, and a
civilized human creature can only learn those principles rightly, by
knowing those of great civilized art first--which is always the
representation, to the utmost of its power, of whatever it has got to
show--made to look as like the thing as possible.  Go into the National
Gallery, and look at the foot of Correggio's Venus there.  Correggio
made it as like a foot as he could, and you won't easily find anything
liker.  Now, you will find on any Greek vase something meant for a foot,
or a hand, which is not at all like one.  The Greek vase is a good thing
in its way, but Correggio's picture is the best work.

164.  So, again, go into the Turner room of the National Gallery, and
look at Turner's drawing of "Ivy Bridge."  You will find the water in it
is like real water, and the ducks in it are like real ducks.  Then go
into the British Museum, and look for an Egyptian landscape, and you will
find the water in that constituted of blue zigzags, not at all like
water; and ducks in the middle of it made of blue lines, looking not in
the least as if they could stand stuffing with sage and onions.  They are
very good in their way, but Turner's are better.

165.  I will not pause to fence my general principle against what you
perfectly well know of the due contradiction,--that a thing may be
painted very like, yet painted ill.  Rest content with knowing that it
must be like, if it is painted well; and take this further general law:
Imitation is like charity.  When it is done for love it is lovely; when
it is done for show, hateful.

166.  Well, then, this Greek coin is fine, first because the face is like
a face.  Perhaps you think there is something particularly handsome in
the face, which you can't see in the photograph, or can't at present
appreciate.  But there is nothing of the kind.  It is a very regular,
quiet, commonplace sort of face; and any average English gentleman's, of
good descent, would be far handsomer.

167.  Fix that in your heads also, therefore, that Greek faces are not
particularly beautiful.  Of that much nonsense against which you are to
keep your ears shut, that which is talked to you of the Greek ideal of
beauty is the absolutest.  There is not a single instance of a very
beautiful head left by the highest school of Greek art.  On coins, there
is even no approximately beautiful one.  The Juno of Argos is a virago;
the Athena of Athens grotesque, the Athena of Corinth is insipid; and of
Thurium, sensual.  The Siren Ligeia, and fountain of Arethusa, on the
coins of Terina and Syracuse, are prettier, but totally without
expression, and chiefly set off by their well-curled hair.  You might
have expected something subtle in Mercuries; but the Mercury of Ænus is
a very stupid-looking fellow, in a cap like a bowl, with a knob on the
top of it.  The Bacchus of Thasos is a drayman with his hair pomatum'd.
The Jupiter of Syracurse is, however, calm and refined; and the Apollo
of Clazomenæ would have been impressive, if he had not come down to us,
much flattened by friction.  But on the whole, the merit of Greek coins
does not primarily depend on beauty of features, nor even, in the period
of highest art, that of the statues.  You make take the Venus of Melos as
a standard of beauty of the central Greek type.  She has tranquil,
regular, and lofty features; but could not hold her own for a moment
against the beauty of a simple English girl, of pure race and kind heart.

168.  And the reason that Greek art, on the whole, bores you (and you
know it does), is that you are always forced to look in it for something
that is not there; but which may be seen every day, in real life, all
round you; and which you are naturally disposed to delight in, and ought
to delight in.  For the Greek race was not at all one of exalted beauty,
but only of general and healthy completeness of form.  They were only,
and could be only, beautiful in body to the degree that they were
beautiful in soul (for you will find, when you read deeply into the
matter, that the body is only the soul made visible).  And the Greeks
were indeed very good people, much better people than most of us think,
or than many of us are; but there are better people alive now than the
best of them, and lovelier people to be seen now than the loveliest of
them.

169.  Then what are the merits of this Greek art, which make it so
exemplary for you?  Well, not that it is beautiful, but that it is
Right.*  All that it desires to do, it does, and all that it does, does
well.  You will find, as you advance in the knowledge of art, that its
laws of self-restraint are very marvelous; that its peace of heart, and
contentment in doing a simple thing, with only one or two qualities,
restrictedly desired, and sufficiently attained, are a most wholesome
element of education for you, as opposed to the wild writhing, and
wrestling, and longing for the moon, and tilting at windmills, and agony
of eyes, and torturing of fingers, and general spinning out of one's
soul into fiddle-strings, which constitute the ideal life of a modern
artist.


* Compare above, §101.


Also observe, there is an entire masterhood of its business up to the
required point.  A Greek does not reach after other people's strength,
nor outreach his own.  He never tries to paint before he can draw; he
never tries to lay on flesh where there are no bones; and he never
expects to find the bones of anything in his inner consciousness.  Those
are his first merits--sincere and innocent purpose, strong common-sense
and principle, and all the strength that follows on that strength.

170.  But, secondly, Greek art is always exemplary in disposition of
masses, which is a thing that in modern days students rarely look for,
artists not enough, and the public never.  But, whatever else Greek work
may fail of, you may always be sure its masses are well placed, and their
placing has been the object of the most subtle care.  Look, for instance,
at the inscription in front of this Hercules of the name of the town--
Camarina.  You can't read it, even though you may know Greek, without
some pains; for the sculptor knew well enough that it mattered very
little whether you read it or not, for the Camarina Hercules could tell
his own story; but what did above all things matter was, that no K or A
or M should come in a wrong place with respect to the outline of the
head, and divert the eye from it, or spoil any of its lines.  So the
whole inscription is thrown into a sweeping curve of gradually
diminishing size, continuing from the lion's paws, round the neck, up to
the forehead, and answering a decorative purpose as completely as the
curls of the mane opposite.  Of these, again, you cannot change or
displace one without mischief; they are almost as even in reticulation as
a piece of basket-work; but each has a different form and a due relation
to the rest, and if you set to work to draw that mane rightly, you will
find that, whatever time you give to it, you can't get the tresses quite
into their places, and that every tress out of its place does an injury.
If you want to test your powers of accurate drawing, you may make that
lion's mane your pons asinorum, I have never yet met with a student who
didn't make an ass in a lion's skin of himself when he tried it.

171.  Granted, however, that these tresses may be finely placed, still
they are not like a lion's mane.  So we come back to the question,--if
the face is to be like a man's face, why is not the lion's mane to be
like a lion's mane?  Well, because it can't be like a lion's mane without
too much trouble,--and inconvenience after that, and poor success, after
all.  Too much trouble, in cutting the die into fine fringes and jags;
inconvenience after that,--because, though you can easily stamp cheeks
and foreheads smooth at a blow, you can't stamp projecting tresses fine
at a blow, whatever pains you take with your die.

So your Greek uses his common sense, wastes no time, uses no skill, and
says to you, "Here is beautifully set tresses, which I have carefully
designed and easily stamped.  Enjoy them, and if you cannot understand
that they mean lion's mane, heaven mend your wits."

172.  See, then, you have in this work well-founded knowledge, simple and
right aims, thorough mastery of handicraft, splendid invention in
arrangement, unerring common sense in treatment,--merits, these, I think,
exemplary enough to justify our tormenting you a little with Greek art.
But it has one merit more than these, the greatest of all.  It always
means something worth saying.  Not merely worth saying for that time
only, but for all time.  What do you think this helmet of lion's hide is
always given to Hercules for?  You can't suppose it means only that he
once killed a lion, and always carried its skin afterwards to show that
he had, as Indian sportsmen sent home stuffed rugs, with claws at the
corners, and a lump in the middle which one tumbles over every time one
stirs the fire.  What was this Nemean Lion, whose spoils were evermore to
cover Hercules from the cold?  Not merely a large specimen of Felis Leo,
ranging the fields of Nemea, be sure of that.  This Nemean cub was one of
a bad litter.  Born of Typhon and Echidna,--of the whirlwind and the
snake,--Cerberus his brother, the Hydra of Lerna his sister,--it must
have been difficult to get his hide off him.  He had to be found in
darkness, too, and dealt upon without weapons, by grip at the throat--
arrows and club of no avail against him.  What does all that mean?

173.  It means that the Nemean Lion is the first great adversary of life,
whatever that may be--to Hercules, or to any of us, then or now.  The
first monster we have to strangle, or be destroyed by, fighting in the
dark, and with none to help us, only Athena standing by to encourage with
her smile.  Every man's Nemean Lion lies in wait for him somewhere.  The
slothful man says, There is a lion in the path.  He says well.  The quiet
unslothful man says the same, and knows it too.  But they differ in their
further reading of the text.  The slothful man says, I shall be slain,
and the unslothful, IT shall be.  It is the first ugly and strong enemy
that rises against us, all future victory depending on victory over that.
Kill it; and through all the rest of your life, what was once dreadful is
your armor, and you are clothed with that conquest for every other, and
helmed with its crest of fortitude for evermore.

Alas, we have most of us to walk bare-headed; but that is the meaning of
the story of Nemea,--worth laying to heart and thinking of sometimes,
when you see a dish garnished with parsley, which was the crown at the
Nemean games.

174.  How far, then, have we got in our list of the merits of Greek art
now?

      Sound knowledge.
      Simple aims.
      Mastered craft.
      Vivid invention.
      Strong common sense.
      And eternally true and wise meaning.

Are these not enough?  Here is one more, then, which will find favor, I
should think, with the British Lion.  Greek art is never frightened at
anything; it is always cool.

175.  It differs essentially from all other art, past or present, in this
incapability of being frightened.  Half the power and imagination of
every other school depend on a certain feverish terror mingling with
their  sense of beauty,--the feeling that a child has in a dark room, or
a sick person in seeing ugly dreams.  But the Greeks never have ugly
dreams.  They cannot draw anything ugly when they try.  Sometimes they
put themselves to their wits'-end to draw an ugly thing,--the Medusa's
head, for instance,--but they can't do it, not they, because nothing
frightens them.  They widen the mouth, and grind the teeth, and puff the
cheeks, and set the eyes a goggling; and the thing is only ridiculous
after all, not the least dreadful, for there is no dread in their hearts.
Pensiveness; amazement; often deepest grief and desolateness.  All these;
but terror never.  Everlasting calm in the presence of all fate; and joy
such as they could win, not indeed in a perfect beauty, but in beauty at
perfect rest!  A kind of art this, surely, to be looked at, and thought
upon sometimes with profit, even in these latter days.

176.  To be looked at sometimes.  Not continually, and never as a model
for imitation.  For you are not Greeks; but, for better or worse, English
creatures; and cannot do, even if it were a thousand times better worth
doing, anything well, except what your English hearts shall prompt, and
your English skies teach you.  For all good art is the natural utterance
of its own people in its own day.

But also, your own art is a better and brighter one than ever this Greek
art was.  Many motives, powers, and insights have been added to those
elder ones.  The very corruptions into which we have fallen are signs of
a subtle life, higher than theirs was, and therefore more fearful in its
faults and death.  Christianity has neither superceded, nor, by itself,
excelled heathenism; but it has added its own good, won also by many a
Nemean contest in dark valleys, to all that was good and noble in
heathenism; and our present thoughts and work, when they are right, are
nobler than the heathen's.  And we are not reverent enough to them,
because we possess too much of them.  That sketch of four cherub heads
from and English girl, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, at Kensington, is an
incomparably finer thing than ever the Greeks did.  Ineffably tender in
the touch, yet Herculean in power; innocent, yet exalted in feeling; pure
in color as a pearl; reserved and decisive in design, as this Lion crest,
--if it alone existed of such,--if it were a picture by Zeuxis, the only
one left in the world, and you build a shrine for it, and were allowed to
see it only seven days in a year, it alone would teach you all of art
that you ever needed to know.  But you do not learn from this or any
other such work, because you have not reverence enough for them, and are
trying to learn from all at once, and from a hundred other masters
besides.

177.  Here, then, is the practical advice which I would venture to deduce
from what I have tried to show you.  Use Greek art as a first, not a
final, teacher.  Learn to draw carefully from Greek work; above all, to
place forms correctly, and to use light and shade tenderly.  Never allow
yourselves black shadows.  It is easy to make things look round and
projecting; but the things to exercise yourselves in are the placing of
the masses, and the modelling of the lights.  It is an admirable exercise
to take a pale wash of color for all the shadows, never reinforcing it
everywhere, but drawing the statue as if it were in far distance, making
all the darks one flat pale tint.  Then model from those into the lights,
rounding as well as you can, on those subtle conditions.  In your chalk
drawings, separate the lights from the darks at once all over; then
reinforce the darks slightly where absolutely necessary, and put your
whole strength on the lights and their limits.  Then, when you have
learned to draw thoroughly, take one master for your painting, as you
would have done necessarily in old times by being put into his school
(were I to choose for you, it should be among six men only--Titian,
Correggio, Paul Veronese, Velasquez, Reynolds, or Holbein).  If you are a
landscapist, Turner must be your only guide (for no other great landscape
painter has yet lived); and having chosen, do your best to understand
your own chosen master, and obey him, and no one else, till you have
strength to deal with the nature itself round you, and then, be your own
master, and see with your own eyes.  If you have got masterhood or sight
in you, that is the way to make the most of them; and if you have
neither, you will at least be sound in your work, prevented from immodest
and useless effort, and protected from vulgar and fantastic error.

And so I wish you all, good speed, and the favor of Hercules and of the
Muses; and to those who shall best deserve them, the crown of Parsley
first and then of the Laurel.

THE SEVEN LAMPS OF ARCHITECTURE




PREFACE.


The memoranda which form the basis of the following Essay have been
thrown together during the preparation of one of the sections of the
third volume of "Modern Painters."[A] I once thought of giving them a
more expanded form; but their utility, such as it may be, would probably
be diminished by farther delay in their publication, more than it would
be increased by greater care in their arrangement. Obtained in every
case by personal observation, there may be among them some details
valuable even to the experienced architect; but with respect to the
opinions founded upon them I must be prepared to bear the charge of
impertinence which can hardly but attach to the writer who assumes a
dogmatical tone in speaking of an art he has never practised. There are,
however, cases in which men feel too keenly to be silent, and perhaps
too strongly to be wrong; I have been forced into this impertinence; and
have suffered too much from the destruction or neglect of the
architecture I best loved, and from the erection of that which I cannot
love, to reason cautiously respecting the modesty of my opposition to
the principles which have induced the scorn of the one, or directed the
design of the other. And I have been the less careful to modify the
confidence of my statements of principles, because in the midst of the
opposition and uncertainty of our architectural systems, it seems to me
that there is something grateful in any _positive_ opinion, though in
many points wrong, as even weeds are useful that grow on a bank of sand.

    [A] The inordinate delay in the appearance of that supplementary
    volume has, indeed, been chiefly owing to the necessity under which
    the writer felt himself, of obtaining as many memoranda as possible
    of mediæval buildings in Italy and Normandy, now in process of
    destruction, before that destruction should be consummated by the
    Restorer or Revolutionist. His whole time has been lately occupied
    in taking drawings from one side of buildings, of which masons were
    knocking down the other; nor can he yet pledge himself to any time
    for the publication of the conclusion of "Modern Painters;" he can
    only promise that its delay shall not be owing to any indolence on
    his part.

Every apology is, however, due to the reader, for the hasty and
imperfect execution of the plates. Having much more serious work in
hand, and desiring merely to render them illustrative of my meaning, I
have sometimes very completely failed even of that humble aim; and the
text, being generally written before the illustration was completed,
sometimes naïvely describes as sublime or beautiful, features which the
plate represents by a blot. I shall be grateful if the reader will in
such cases refer the expressions of praise to the Architecture, and not
to the illustration.

So far, however, as their coarseness and rudeness admit, the plates are
valuable; being either copies of memoranda made upon the spot, or
(Plates IX. and XI.) enlarged and adapted from Daguerreotypes, taken
under my own superintendence. Unfortunately, the great distance from the
ground of the window which is the subject of Plate IX. renders even the
Daguerreotype indistinct; and I cannot answer for the accuracy of any of
the mosaic details, more especially of those which surround the window,
and which I rather imagine, in the original, to be sculptured in relief.
The general proportions are, however, studiously preserved; the spirals
of the shafts are counted, and the effect of the whole is as near that
of the thing itself, as is necessary for the purposes of illustration
for which the plate is given. For the accuracy of the rest I can answer,
even to the cracks in the stones, and the number of them; and though the
looseness of the drawing, and the picturesque character which is
necessarily given by an endeavor to draw old buildings as they actually
appear, may perhaps diminish their credit for architectural veracity,
they will do so unjustly.

The system of lettering adopted in the few instances in which sections
have been given, appears somewhat obscure in the references, but it is
convenient upon the whole. The line which marks the direction of any
section is noted, if the section be symmetrical, by a single letter; and
the section itself by the same letter with a line over it, a.--[=a]. But
if the section be unsymmetrical, its direction is noted by two letters,
a. a. a_2 at its extremities; and the actual section by the same letters
with lines over them, [=a]. [=a]. [=a]_2, at the corresponding
extremities.

The reader will perhaps be surprised by the small number of buildings to
which reference has been made. But it is to be remembered that the
following chapters pretend only to be a statement of principles,
illustrated each by one or two examples, not an essay on European
architecture; and those examples I have generally taken either from the
buildings which I love best, or from the schools of architecture which,
it appeared to me, have been less carefully described than they
deserved. I could as fully, though not with the accuracy and certainty
derived from personal observation, have illustrated the principles
subsequently advanced, from the architecture of Egypt, India, or Spain,
as from that to which the reader will find his attention chiefly
directed, the Italian Romanesque and Gothic. But my affections, as well
as my experience, led me to that line of richly varied and magnificently
intellectual schools, which reaches, like a high watershed of Christian
architecture, from the Adriatic to the Northumbrian seas, bordered by
the impure schools of Spain on the one hand, and of Germany on the
other: and as culminating points and centres of this chain, I have
considered, first, the cities of the Val d'Arno, as representing the
Italian Romanesque and pure Italian Gothic; Venice and Verona as
representing the Italian Gothic colored by Byzantine elements; and
Rouen, with the associated Norman cities, Caen, Bayeux, and Coutances,
as representing the entire range of Northern architecture from the
Romanesque to Flamboyant.

I could have wished to have given more examples from our early English
Gothic; but I have always found it impossible to work in the cold
interiors of our cathedrals, while the daily services, lamps, and
fumigation of those upon the Continent, render them perfectly safe.
In the course of last summer I undertook a pilgrimage to the English
Shrines, and began with Salisbury, where the consequence of a few days'
work was a state of weakened health, which I may be permitted to name
among the causes of the slightness and imperfection of the present
Essay.




INTRODUCTORY.


Some years ago, in conversation with an artist whose works, perhaps,
alone, in the present day, unite perfection of drawing with resplendence
of color, the writer made some inquiry respecting the general means by
which this latter quality was most easily to be attained. The reply was
as concise as it was comprehensive--"Know what you have to do, and do
it"--comprehensive, not only as regarded the branch of art to which it
temporarily applied, but as expressing the great principle of success in
every direction of human effort; for I believe that failure is less
frequently attributable to either insufficiency of means or impatience
of labor, than to a confused understanding of the thing actually to be
done; and therefore, while it is properly a subject of ridicule, and
sometimes of blame, that men propose to themselves a perfection of any
kind, which reason, temperately consulted, might have shown to be
impossible with the means at their command, it is a more dangerous error
to permit the consideration of means to interfere with our conception,
or, as is not impossible, even hinder our acknowledgment of goodness and
perfection in themselves. And this is the more cautiously to be
remembered; because, while a man's sense and conscience, aided by
Revelation, are always enough, if earnestly directed, to enable him to
discover what is right, neither his sense, nor conscience, nor feeling,
are ever enough, because they are not intended, to determine for him
what is possible. He knows neither his own strength nor that of his
fellows, neither the exact dependence to be placed on his allies nor
resistance to be expected from his opponents. These are questions
respecting which passion may warp his conclusions, and ignorance must
limit them; but it is his own fault if either interfere with the
apprehension of duty, or the acknowledgment of right. And, as far as I
have taken cognizance of the causes of the many failures to which the
efforts of intelligent men are liable, more especially in matters
political, they seem to me more largely to spring from this single error
than from all others, that the inquiry into the doubtful, and in some
sort inexplicable, relations of capability, chance, resistance, and
inconvenience, invariably precedes, even if it do not altogether
supersede, the determination of what is absolutely desirable and just.
Nor is it any wonder that sometimes the too cold calculation of our
powers should reconcile us too easily to our shortcomings, and even lead
us into the fatal error of supposing that our conjectural utmost is in
itself well, or, in other words, that the necessity of offences renders
them inoffensive.

What is true of human polity seems to me not less so of the
distinctively political art of Architecture. I have long felt convinced
of the necessity, in order to its progress, of some determined effort to
extricate from the confused mass of partial traditions and dogmata with
which it has become encumbered during imperfect or restricted practice,
those large principles of right which are applicable to every stage and
style of it. Uniting the technical and imaginative elements as
essentially as humanity does soul and body, it shows the same infirmly
balanced liability to the prevalence of the lower part over the higher,
to the interference of the constructive, with the purity and simplicity
of the reflective, element. This tendency, like every other form of
materialism, is increasing with the advance of the age; and the only
laws which resist it, based upon partial precedents, and already
regarded with disrespect as decrepit, if not with defiance as
tyrannical, are evidently inapplicable to the new forms and functions of
the art, which the necessities of the day demand. How many these
necessities may become, cannot be conjectured; they rise, strange and
impatient, out of every modern shadow of change. How far it may be
possible to meet them without a sacrifice of the essential characters of
architectural art, cannot be determined by specific calculation or
observance. There is no law, no principle, based on past practice,
which may not be overthrown in a moment, by the arising of a new
condition, or the invention of a new material; and the most rational, if
not the only, mode of averting the danger of an utter dissolution of all
that is systematic and consistent in our practice, or of ancient
authority in our judgment, is to cease for a little while, our endeavors
to deal with the multiplying host of particular abuses, restraints, or
requirements; and endeavor to determine, as the guides of every effort,
some constant, general, and irrefragable laws of right--laws, which
based upon man's nature, not upon his knowledge, may possess so far the
unchangeableness of the one, as that neither the increase nor
imperfection of the other may be able to assault or invalidate them.

There are, perhaps, no such laws peculiar to any one art. Their range
necessarily includes the entire horizon of man's action. But they have
modified forms and operations belonging to each of his pursuits, and the
extent of their authority cannot surely be considered as a diminution of
its weight. Those peculiar aspects of them which belong to the first of
the arts, I have endeavored to trace in the following pages; and since,
if truly stated, they must necessarily be, not only safeguards against
every form of error, but sources of every measure of success, I do not
think that I claim too much for them in calling them the Lamps of
Architecture, nor that it is indolence, in endeavoring to ascertain the
true nature and nobility of their fire, to refuse to enter into any
curious or special questioning of the innumerable hindrances by which
their light has been too often distorted or overpowered.

Had this farther examination been attempted, the work would have become
certainly more invidious, and perhaps less useful, as liable to errors
which are avoided by the present simplicity of its plan. Simple though
it be, its extent is too great to admit of any adequate accomplishment,
unless by a devotion of time which the writer did not feel justified in
withdrawing from branches of inquiry in which the prosecution of works
already undertaken has engaged him. Both arrangements and nomenclature
are those of convenience rather than of system; the one is arbitrary and
the other illogical: nor is it pretended that all, or even the greater
number of, the principles necessary to the well-being of the art, are
included in the inquiry. Many, however, of considerable importance will
be found to develope themselves incidentally from those more specially
brought forward.

Graver apology is necessary for an apparently graver fault. It has been
just said, that there is no branch of human work whose constant laws
have not close analogy with those which govern every other mode of man's
exertion. But, more than this, exactly as we reduce to greater
simplicity and surety any one group of these practical laws, we shall
find them passing the mere condition of connection or analogy, and
becoming the actual expression of some ultimate nerve or fibre of the
mighty laws which govern the moral world. However mean or inconsiderable
the act, there is something in the well doing of it, which has
fellowship with the noblest forms of manly virtue; and the truth,
decision, and temperance, which we reverently regard as honorable
conditions of the spiritual being, have a representative or derivative
influence over the works of the hand, the movements of the frame, and
the action of the intellect.

And as thus every action, down even to the drawing of a line or
utterance of a syllable, is capable of a peculiar dignity in the manner
of it, which we sometimes express by saying it is truly done (as a line
or tone is true), so also it is capable of dignity still higher in the
motive of it. For there is no action so slight, nor so mean, but it may
be done to a great purpose, and ennobled therefore; nor is any purpose
so great but that slight actions may help it, and may be so done as to
help it much, most especially that chief of all purposes, the pleasing
of God. Hence George Herbert--

  "A servant with this clause
    Makes drudgery divine;
  Who sweeps a room, as for thy laws,
    Makes that and the action fine."

Therefore, in the pressing or recommending of any act or manner of
acting, we have choice of two separate lines of argument: one based on
representation of the expediency or inherent value of the work, which is
often small, and always disputable; the other based on proofs of its
relations to the higher orders of human virtue, and of its
acceptableness, so far as it goes, to Him who is the origin of virtue.
The former is commonly the more persuasive method, the latter assuredly
the more conclusive; only it is liable to give offence, as if there were
irreverence in adducing considerations so weighty in treating subjects
of small temporal importance. I believe, however, that no error is more
thoughtless than this. We treat God with irreverence by banishing Him
from our thoughts, not by referring to His will on slight occasions. His
is not the finite authority or intelligence which cannot be troubled
with small things. There is nothing so small but that we may honor God
by asking His guidance of it, or insult Him by taking it into our own
hands; and what is true of the Deity is equally true of His Revelation.
We use it most reverently when most habitually: our insolence is in ever
acting without reference to it, our true honoring of it is in its
universal application. I have been blamed for the familiar introduction
of its sacred words. I am grieved to have given pain by so doing; but my
excuse must be my wish that those words were made the ground of every
argument and the test of every action. We have them not often enough on
our lips, nor deeply enough in our memories, nor loyally enough in our
lives. The snow, the vapor, and the stormy wind fulfil His word. Are our
acts and thoughts lighter and wilder than these--that we should forget
it?

I have therefore ventured, at the risk of giving to some passages the
appearance of irreverence, to take the higher line of argument wherever
it appeared clearly traceable: and this, I would ask the reader
especially to observe, not merely because I think it the best mode of
reaching ultimate truth, still less because I think the subject of more
importance than many others; but because every subject should surely, at
a period like the present, be taken up in this spirit, or not at all.
The aspect of the years that approach us is as solemn as it is full of
mystery; and the weight of evil against which we have to contend, is
increasing like the letting out of water. It is no time for the idleness
of metaphysics, or the entertainment of the arts. The blasphemies of the
earth are sounding louder, and its miseries heaped heavier every day;
and if, in the midst of the exertion which every good man is called upon
to put forth for their repression or relief, it is lawful to ask for a
thought, for a moment, for a lifting of the finger, in any direction but
that of the immediate and overwhelming need, it is at least incumbent
upon us to approach the questions in which we would engage him, in the
spirit which has become the habit of his mind, and in the hope that
neither his zeal nor his usefulness may be checked by the withdrawal of
an hour which has shown him how even those things which seemed
mechanical, indifferent, or contemptible, depend for their perfection
upon the acknowledgment of the sacred principles of faith, truth, and
obedience, for which it has become the occupation of his life to
contend.




THE SEVEN LAMPS OF ARCHITECTURE.




CHAPTER I.

THE LAMP OF SACRIFICE.


I. Architecture is the art which so disposes and adorns the edifices
raised by man for whatsoever uses, that the sight of them contributes to
his mental health, power and pleasure.

It is very necessary, in the outset of all inquiry, to distinguish
carefully between Architecture and Building.

To build, literally to confirm, is by common understanding to put
together and adjust the several pieces of any edifice or receptacle of a
considerable size. Thus we have church building, house building, ship
building, and coach building. That one edifice stands, another floats,
and another is suspended on iron springs, makes no difference in the
nature of the art, if so it may be called, of building or edification.
The persons who profess that art, are severally builders,
ecclesiastical, naval, or of whatever other name their work may justify;
but building does not become architecture merely by the stability of
what it erects; and it is no more architecture which raises a church, or
which fits it to receive and contain with comfort a required number of
persons occupied in certain religious offices, than it is architecture
which makes a carriage commodious or a ship swift. I do not, of course,
mean that the word is not often, or even may not be legitimately,
applied in such a sense (as we speak of naval architecture); but in that
sense architecture ceases to be one of the fine arts, and it is
therefore better not to run the risk, by loose nomenclature, of the
confusion which would arise, and has often arisen, from extending
principles which belong altogether to building, into the sphere of
architecture proper.

Let us, therefore, at once confine the name to that art which, taking up
and admitting, as conditions of its working, the necessities and common
uses of the building, impresses on its form certain characters venerable
or beautiful, but otherwise unnecessary. Thus, I suppose, no one would
call the laws architectural which determine the height of a breastwork
or the position of a bastion. But if to the stone facing of that bastion
be added an unnecessary feature, as a cable moulding, _that_ is
Architecture. It would be similarly unreasonable to call battlements or
machicolations architectural features, so long as they consist only of
an advanced gallery supported on projecting masses, with open intervals
beneath for offence. But if these projecting masses be carved beneath
into rounded courses, which are useless, and if the headings of the
intervals be arched and trefoiled, which is useless, _that_ is
Architecture. It may not be always easy to draw the line so sharply and
simply, because there are few buildings which have not some pretence or
color of being architectural; neither can there be any architecture
which is not based on building, nor any good architecture which is not
based on good building; but it is perfectly easy and very necessary to
keep the ideas distinct, and to understand fully that Architecture
concerns itself only with those characters of an edifice which are above
and beyond its common use. I say common; because a building raised to
the honor of God, or in memory of men, has surely a use to which its
architectural adornment fits it; but not a use which limits, by any
inevitable necessities, its plan or details.

II. Architecture proper, then, naturally arranges itself under five
heads:--

  Devotional; including all buildings raised for God's service or honor.

  Memorial; including both monuments and tombs.

  Civil; including every edifice raised by nations or societies, for
        purposes of common business or pleasure.

  Military; including all private and public architecture of defence.

  Domestic; including every rank and kind of dwelling-place.

Now, of the principles which I would endeavor to develope, while all
must be, as I have said, applicable to every stage and style of the art,
some, and especially those which are exciting rather than directing,
have necessarily fuller reference to one kind of building than another;
and among these I would place first that spirit which, having influence
in all, has nevertheless such especial reference to devotional and
memorial architecture--the spirit which offers for such work precious
things simply because they are precious; not as being necessary to the
building, but as an offering, surrendering, and sacrifice of what is to
ourselves desirable. It seems to me, not only that this feeling is in
most cases wholly wanting in those who forward the devotional buildings
of the present day; but that it would even be regarded as an ignorant,
dangerous, or perhaps criminal principle by many among us. I have not
space to enter into dispute of all the various objections which may be
urged against it--they are many and spacious; but I may, perhaps, ask
the reader's patience while I set down those simple reasons which cause
me to believe it a good and just feeling, and as well-pleasing to God
and honorable in men, as it is beyond all dispute necessary to the
production of any great work in the kind with which we are at present
concerned.

III. Now, first, to define this Lamp, or Spirit of Sacrifice, clearly. I
have said that it prompts us to the offering of precious things merely
because they are precious, not because they are useful or necessary. It
is a spirit, for instance, which of two marbles, equally beautiful,
applicable and durable, would choose the more costly because it was so,
and of two kinds of decoration, equally effective, would choose the more
elaborate because it was so, in order that it might in the same compass
present more cost and more thought. It is therefore most unreasoning and
enthusiastic, and perhaps best negatively defined, as the opposite of
the prevalent feeling of modern times, which desires to produce the
largest results at the least cost.

Of this feeling, then, there are two distinct forms: the first, the wish
to exercise self-denial for the sake of self-discipline merely, a wish
acted upon in the abandonment of things loved or desired, there being no
direct call or purpose to be answered by so doing; and the second, the
desire to honor or please some one else by the costliness of the
sacrifice. The practice is, in the first case, either private or public;
but most frequently, and perhaps most properly, private; while, in the
latter case, the act is commonly, and with greatest advantage, public.
Now, it cannot but at first appear futile to assert the expediency of
self-denial for its own sake, when, for so many sakes, it is every day
necessary to a far greater degree than any of us practise it. But I
believe it is just because we do not enough acknowledge or contemplate
it as a good in itself, that we are apt to fail in its duties when they
become imperative, and to calculate, with some partiality, whether the
good proposed to others measures or warrants the amount of grievance to
ourselves, instead of accepting with gladness the opportunity of
sacrifice as a personal advantage. Be this as it may, it is not
necessary to insist upon the matter here; since there are always higher
and more useful channels of self-sacrifice, for those who choose to
practise it, than any connected with the arts.

While in its second branch, that which is especially concerned with the
arts, the justice of the feeling is still more doubtful; it depends on
our answer to the broad question, Can the Deity be indeed honored by the
presentation to Him of any material objects of value, or by any
direction of zeal or wisdom which is not immediately beneficial to men?

For, observe, it is not now the question whether the fairness and
majesty of a building may or may not answer any moral purpose; it is not
the _result_ of labor in any sort of which we are speaking, but the bare
and mere costliness--the substance and labor and time themselves: are
these, we ask, independently of their result, acceptable offerings to
God, and considered by Him as doing Him honor? So long as we refer this
question to the decision of feeling, or of conscience, or of reason
merely, it will be contradictorily or imperfectly answered; it admits of
entire answer only when we have met another and a far different
question, whether the Bible be indeed one book or two, and whether the
character of God revealed in the Old Testament be other than His
character revealed in the New.

IV. Now, it is a most secure truth, that, although the particular
ordinances divinely appointed for special purposes at any given period
of man's history, may be by the same divine authority abrogated at
another, it is impossible that any character of God, appealed to or
described in any ordinance past or present, can ever be changed, or
understood as changed, by the abrogation of that ordinance. God is one
and the same, and is pleased or displeased by the same things for ever,
although one part of His pleasure may be expressed at one time rather
than another, and although the mode in which His pleasure is to be
consulted may be by Him graciously modified to the circumstances of men.
Thus, for instance, it was necessary that, in order to the understanding
by man of the scheme of Redemption, that scheme should be foreshown from
the beginning by the type of bloody sacrifice. But God had no more
pleasure in such sacrifice in the time of Moses than He has now; He
never accepted as a propitiation for sin any sacrifice but the single
one in prospective; and that we may not entertain any shadow of doubt on
this subject, the worthlessness of all other sacrifice than this is
proclaimed at the very time when typical sacrifice was most imperatively
demanded. God was a spirit, and could be worshipped only in spirit and
in truth, as singly and exclusively when every day brought its claim of
typical and material service or offering, as now when He asks for none
but that of the heart.

So, therefore, it is a most safe and sure principle that, if in the
manner of performing any rite at any time, circumstances can be traced
which we are either told, or may legitimately conclude, _pleased_ God at
that time, those same circumstances will please Him at all times, in the
performance of all rites or offices to which they may be attached in
like manner; unless it has been afterwards revealed that, for some
special purpose, it is now His will that such circumstances should be
withdrawn. And this argument will have all the more force if it can be
shown that such conditions were not essential to the completeness of
the rite in its human uses and bearings, and only were added to it as
being in _themselves_ pleasing to God.

V. Now, was it necessary to the completeness, as a type, of the
Levitical sacrifice, or to its utility as an explanation of divine
purposes, that it should cost anything to the person in whose behalf it
was offered? On the contrary, the sacrifice which it foreshowed was to
be God's free gift; and the cost of, or difficulty of obtaining, the
sacrificial type, could only render that type in a measure obscure, and
less expressive of the offering which God would in the end provide for
all men. Yet this costliness was _generally_ a condition of the
acceptableness of the sacrifice. "Neither will I offer unto the Lord my
God of that which doth cost me nothing."[B] That costliness, therefore,
must be an acceptable condition in all human offerings at all times; for
if it was pleasing to God once, it must please Him always, unless
directly forbidden by Him afterwards, which it has never been.

    [B] 2 Sam. xxiv. 24. Deut. xvi. 16, 17.

Again, was it necessary to the typical perfection of the Levitical
offering, that it should be the best of the flock? Doubtless the
spotlessness of the sacrifice renders it more expressive to the
Christian mind; but was it because so expressive that it was actually,
and in so many words, demanded by God? Not at all. It was demanded by
Him expressly on the same grounds on which an earthly governor would
demand it, as a testimony of respect. "Offer it now unto thy
governor."[C] And the less valuable offering was rejected, not because
it did not image Christ, nor fulfil the purposes of sacrifice, but
because it indicated a feeling that would grudge the best of its
possessions to Him who gave them; and because it was a bold dishonoring
of God in the sight of man. Whence it may be infallibly concluded, that
in whatever offerings we may now see reason to present unto God (I say
not what these may be), a condition of their acceptableness will be now,
as it was then, that they should be the best of their kind.

    [C] Mal. i. 8.

VI. But farther, was it necessary to the carrying out of the Mosaical
system, that there should be either art or splendor in the form or
services of the tabernacle or temple? Was it necessary to the
perfection of any one of their typical offices, that there should be
that hanging of blue, and purple, and scarlet? those taches of brass and
sockets of silver? that working in cedar and overlaying with gold? One
thing at least is evident: there was a deep and awful danger in it; a
danger that the God whom they so worshipped, might be associated in the
minds of the serfs of Egypt with the gods to whom they had seen similar
gifts offered and similar honors paid. The probability, in our times, of
fellowship with the feelings of the idolatrous Romanist is absolutely as
nothing compared with the danger to the Israelite of a sympathy with the
idolatrous Egyptian;[1] no speculative, no unproved danger; but proved
fatally by their fall during a month's abandonment to their own will; a
fall into the most servile idolatry; yet marked by such offerings to
their idol as their leader was, in the close sequel, instructed to bid
them offer to God. This danger was imminent, perpetual, and of the most
awful kind: it was the one against which God made provision, not only by
commandments, by threatenings, by promises, the most urgent, repeated,
and impressive; but by temporary ordinances of a severity so terrible as
almost to dim for a time, in the eyes of His people, His attribute of
mercy. The principal object of every instituted law of that Theocracy,
of every judgment sent forth in its vindication, was to mark to the
people His hatred of idolatry; a hatred written under their advancing
steps, in the blood of the Canaanite, and more sternly still in the
darkness of their own desolation, when the children and the sucklings
swooned in the streets of Jerusalem, and the lion tracked his prey in
the dust of Samaria.[D] Yet against this mortal danger provision was not
made in one way (to man's thoughts the simplest, the most natural, the
most effective), by withdrawing from the worship of the Divine Being
whatever could delight the sense, or shape the imagination, or limit the
idea of Deity to place. This one way God refused, demanding for Himself
such honors, and accepting for Himself such local dwelling, as had been
paid and dedicated to idol gods by heathen worshippers; and for what
reason? Was the glory of the tabernacle necessary to set forth or image
His divine glory to the minds of His people? What! purple or scarlet
necessary to the people who had seen the great river of Egypt run
scarlet to the sea, under His condemnation? What! golden lamp and cherub
necessary for those who had seen the fires of heaven falling like a
mantle on Mount Sinai, and its golden courts opened to receive their
mortal lawgiver? What! silver clasp and fillet necessary when they had
seen the silver waves of the Red Sea clasp in their arched hollows the
corpses of the horse and his rider? Nay--not so. There was but one
reason, and that an eternal one; that as the covenant that He made with
men was accompanied with some external sign of its continuance, and of
His remembrance of it, so the acceptance of that covenant might be
marked and signified by use, in some external sign of their love and
obedience, and surrender of themselves and theirs to His will; and that
their gratitude to Him, and continual remembrance of Him, might have at
once their expression and their enduring testimony in the presentation
to Him, not only of the firstlings of the herd and fold, not only of the
fruits of the earth and the tithe of time, but of all treasures of
wisdom and beauty; of the thought that invents, and the hand that
labors; of wealth of wood, and weight of stone; of the strength of iron,
and of the light of gold.

    [D] Lam. ii. 11. 2 Kings xvii. 25.

And let us not now lose sight of this broad and unabrogated principle--I
might say, incapable of being abrogated, so long as men shall receive
earthly gifts from God. Of all that they have His tithe must be rendered
to Him, or in so far and in so much He is forgotten: of the skill and of
the treasure, of the strength and of the mind, of the time and of the
toil, offering must be made reverently; and if there be any difference
between the Levitical and the Christian offering, it is that the latter
may be just so much the wider in its range as it is less typical in its
meaning, as it is thankful instead of sacrificial. There can be no
excuse accepted because the Deity does not now visibly dwell in His
temple; if He is invisible it is only through our failing faith: nor any
excuse because other calls are more immediate or more sacred; this
ought to be done, and not the other left undone. Yet this objection, as
frequent as feeble, must be more specifically answered.

VII. It has been said--it ought always to be said, for it is true--that
a better and more honorable offering is made to our Master in ministry
to the poor, in extending the knowledge of His name, in the practice of
the virtues by which that name is hallowed, than in material presents to
His temple. Assuredly it is so: woe to all who think that any other kind
or manner of offering may in any wise take the place of these! Do the
people need place to pray, and calls to hear His word? Then it is no
time for smoothing pillars or carving pulpits; let us have enough first
of walls and roofs. Do the people need teaching from house to house, and
bread from day to day? Then they are deacons and ministers we want, not
architects. I insist on this, I plead for this; but let us examine
ourselves, and see if this be indeed the reason for our backwardness in
the lesser work. The question is not between God's house and His poor:
it is not between God's house and His Gospel. It is between God's house
and ours. Have we no tesselated colors on our floors? no frescoed
fancies on our roofs? no niched statuary in our corridors? no gilded
furniture in our chambers? no costly stones in our cabinets? Has even
the tithe of these been offered? They are, or they ought to be, the
signs that enough has been devoted to the great purposes of human
stewardship, and that there remains to us what we can spend in luxury;
but there is a greater and prouder luxury than this selfish one--that of
bringing a portion of such things as these into sacred service, and
presenting them for a memorial[E] that our pleasure as well as our toil
has been hallowed by the remembrance of Him who gave both the strength
and the reward. And until this has been done, I do not see how such
possessions can be retained in happiness. I do not understand the
feeling which would arch our own gates and pave our own thresholds, and
leave the church with its narrow door and foot-worn sill; the feeling
which enriches our own chambers with all manner of costliness, and
endures the bare wall and mean compass of the temple. There is seldom
even so severe a choice to be made, seldom so much self-denial to be
exercised. There are isolated cases, in which men's happiness and mental
activity depend upon a certain degree of luxury in their houses; but
then this is true luxury, felt and tasted, and profited by. In the
plurality of instances nothing of the kind is attempted, nor can be
enjoyed; men's average resources cannot reach it; and that which they
_can_ reach, gives them no pleasure, and might be spared. It will be
seen, in the course of the following chapters, that I am no advocate for
meanness of private habitation. I would fain introduce into it all
magnificence, care, and beauty, where they are possible; but I would not
have that useless expense in unnoticed fineries or formalities;
cornicings of ceilings and graining of doors, and fringing of curtains,
and thousands such; things which have become foolishly and apathetically
habitual--things on whose common appliance hang whole trades, to which
there never yet belonged the blessing of giving one ray of real
pleasure, or becoming of the remotest or most contemptible use--things
which cause half the expense of life, and destroy more than half its
comfort, manliness, respectability, freshness, and facility. I speak
from experience: I know what it is to live in a cottage with a deal
floor and roof, and a hearth of mica slate; and I know it to be in many
respects healthier and happier than living between a Turkey carpet and
gilded ceiling, beside a steel grate and polished fender. I do not say
that such things have not their place and propriety; but I say this,
emphatically, that the tenth part of the expense which is sacrificed in
domestic vanities, if not absolutely and meaninglessly lost in domestic
discomforts, and incumbrances, would, if collectively offered and wisely
employed, build a marble church for every town in England; such a church
as it should be a joy and a blessing even to pass near in our daily ways
and walks, and as it would bring the light into the eyes to see from
afar, lifting its fair height above the purple crowd of humble roofs.

    [E] Num. xxxi. 54. Psa. lxxvi. 11.

VIII. I have said for every town: I do not want a marble church for
every village; nay, I do not want marble churches at all for their own
sake, but for the sake of the spirit that would build them. The church
has no need of any visible splendors; her power is independent of them,
her purity is in some degree opposed to them. The simplicity of a
pastoral sanctuary is lovelier than the majesty of an urban temple; and
it may be more than questioned whether, to the people, such majesty has
ever been the source of any increase of effective piety; but to the
builders it has been, and must ever be. It is not the church we want,
but the sacrifice; not the emotion of admiration, but the act of
adoration: not the gift, but the giving.[2] And see how much more
charity the full understanding of this might admit, among classes of men
of naturally opposite feelings; and how much more nobleness in the work.
There is no need to offend by importunate, self-proclaiming splendor.
Your gift may be given in an unpresuming way. Cut one or two shafts out
of a porphyry whose preciousness those only would know who would desire
it to be so used; add another month's labor to the undercutting of a few
capitals, whose delicacy will not be seen nor loved by one beholder of
ten thousand; see that the simplest masonry of the edifice be perfect
and substantial; and to those who regard such things, their witness will
be clear and impressive; to those who regard them not, all will at least
be inoffensive. But do not think the feeling itself a folly, or the act
itself useless. Of what use was that dearly-bought water of the well of
Bethlehem with which the King of Israel slaked the dust of Adullam?--yet
was not thus better than if he had drunk it? Of what use was that
passionate act of Christian sacrifice, against which, first uttered by
the false tongue, the very objection we would now conquer took a sullen
tone for ever?[F] So also let us not ask of what use our offering is to
the church: it is at least better for _us_ than if it had been retained
for ourselves. It may be better for others also: there is, at any rate,
a chance of this; though we must always fearfully and widely shun the
thought that the magnificence of the temple can materially add to the
efficiency of the worship or to the power of the ministry. Whatever we
do, or whatever we offer, let it not interfere with the simplicity of
the one, or abate, as if replacing, the zeal of the other. That is the
abuse and fallacy of Romanism, by which the true spirit of Christian
offering is directly contradicted. The treatment of the Papists' temple
is eminently exhibitory; it is surface work throughout; and the danger
and evil of their church decoration lie, not in its reality--not in the
true wealth and art of it, of which the lower people are never
cognizant--but in its tinsel and glitter, in the gilding of the shrine
and painting of the image, in embroidery of dingy robes and crowding of
imitated gems; all this being frequently thrust forward to the
concealment of what is really good or great in their buildings.[3] Of an
offering of gratitude which is neither to be exhibited nor rewarded,
which is neither to win praise nor purchase salvation, the Romanist (as
such) has no conception.

    [F] John xii. 5.

IX. While, however, I would especially deprecate the imputation of any
other acceptableness or usefulness to the gift itself than that which it
receives from the spirit of its presentation, it may be well to observe,
that there is a lower advantage which never fails to accompany a dutiful
observance of any right abstract principle. While the first fruits of
his possessions were required from the Israelite as a testimony of
fidelity, the payment of those first fruits was nevertheless rewarded,
and that connectedly and specifically, by the increase of those
possessions. Wealth, and length of days, and peace, were the promised
and experienced rewards of his offering, though they were not to be the
objects of it. The tithe paid into the storehouse was the expressed
condition of the blessing which there should not be room enough to
receive. And it will be thus always: God never forgets any work or labor
of love; and whatever it may be of which the first and best proportions
or powers have been presented to Him, he will multiply and increase
sevenfold. Therefore, though it may not be necessarily the interest of
religion to admit the service of the arts, the arts will never flourish
until they have been primarily devoted to that service--devoted, both by
architect and employer; by the one in scrupulous, earnest, affectionate
design; by the other in expenditure at least more frank, at least less
calculating, than that which he would admit in the indulgence of his own
private feelings. Let this principle be but once fairly acknowledged
among us; and however it may be chilled and repressed in practice,
however feeble may be its real influence, however the sacredness of it
may be diminished by counter-workings of vanity and self-interest, yet
its mere acknowledgment would bring a reward; and with our present
accumulation of means and of intellect, there would be such an impulse
and vitality given to art as it has not felt since the thirteenth
century. And I do not assert this as other than a national consequence:
I should, indeed, expect a larger measure of every great and spiritual
faculty to be always given where those faculties had been wisely and
religiously employed; but the impulse to which I refer, would be,
humanly speaking, certain; and would naturally result from obedience to
the two great conditions enforced by the Spirit of Sacrifice, first,
that we should in everything do our best; and, secondly, that we should
consider increase of apparent labor as an increase of beauty in the
building. A few practical deductions from these two conditions, and I
have done.

X. For the first: it is alone enough to secure success, and it is for
want of observing it that we continually fail. We are none of us so good
architects as to be able to work habitually beneath our strength; and
yet there is not a building that I know of, lately raised, wherein it is
not sufficiently evident that neither architect nor builder has done his
best. It is the especial characteristic of modern work. All old work
nearly has been hard work. It may be the hard work of children, of
barbarians, of rustics; but it is always their utmost. Ours has as
constantly the look of money's worth, of a stopping short wherever and
whenever we can, of a lazy compliance with low conditions; never of a
fair putting forth of our strength. Let us have done with this kind of
work at once: cast off every temptation to it: do not let us degrade
ourselves voluntarily, and then mutter and mourn over our short comings;
let us confess our poverty or our parsimony, but not belie our human
intellect. It is not even a question of how _much_ we are to do, but of
how it is to be done; it is not a question of doing more, but of doing
better. Do not let us boss our roofs with wretched, half-worked,
blunt-edged rosettes; do not let us flank our gates with rigid
imitations of mediæval statuary. Such things are mere insults to common
sense, and only unfit us for feeling the nobility of their prototypes.
We have so much, suppose, to be spent in decoration; let us go to the
Flaxman of his time, whoever he may be, and bid him carve for us a
single statue, frieze or capital, or as many as we can afford,
compelling upon him the one condition, that they shall be the best he
can do; place them where they will be of the most value, and be content.
Our other capitals may be mere blocks, and our other niches empty. No
matter: better our work unfinished than all bad. It may be that we do
not desire ornament of so high an order; choose, then, a less developed
style, also, if you will, rougher material; the law which we are
enforcing requires only that what we pretend to do and to give, shall
both be the best of their kind; choose, therefore, the Norman hatchet
work, instead of the Flaxman frieze and statue, but let it be the best
hatchet work; and if you cannot afford marble, use Caen stone, but from
the best bed; and if not stone, brick, but the best brick; preferring
always what is good of a lower order of work or material, to what is bad
of a higher; for this is not only the way to improve every kind of work,
and to put every kind of material to better use; but it is more honest
and unpretending, and is in harmony with other just, upright, and manly
principles, whose range we shall have presently to take into
consideration.

XI. The other condition which we had to notice, was the value of the
appearance of labor upon architecture. I have spoken of this before;[G]
and it is, indeed, one of the most frequent sources of pleasure which
belong to the art, always, however, within certain somewhat remarkable
limits. For it does not at first appear easily to be explained why
labor, as represented by materials of value, should, without sense of
wrong or error, bear being wasted; while the waste of actual
workmanship is always painful, so soon as it is apparent. But so it is,
that, while precious materials may, with a certain profusion and
negligence, be employed for the magnificence of what is seldom seen, the
work of man cannot be carelessly and idly bestowed, without an immediate
sense of wrong; as if the strength of the living creature were never
intended by its Maker to be sacrificed in vain, though it is well for us
sometimes to part with what we esteem precious of substance, as showing
that in such a service it becomes but dross and dust. And in the nice
balance between the straitening of effort or enthusiasm on the one hand,
and vainly casting it away upon the other, there are more questions than
can be met by any but very just and watchful feeling. In general it is
less the mere loss of labor that offends us, than the lack of judgment
implied by such loss; so that if men confessedly work for work's sake,
and it does not appear that they are ignorant where or how to make their
labor tell, we shall not be grossly offended. On the contrary, we shall
be pleased if the work be lost in carrying out a principle, or in
avoiding a deception. It, indeed, is a law properly belonging to another
part of our subject, but it may be allowably stated here, that,
whenever, by the construction of a building, some parts of it are hidden
from the eye which are the continuation of others bearing some
consistent ornament, it is not well that the ornament should cease in
the parts concealed; credit is given for it, and it should not be
deceptively withdrawn: as, for instance, in the sculpture of the backs
of the statues of a temple pediment; never, perhaps, to be seen, but yet
not lawfully to be left unfinished. And so in the working out of
ornaments in dark concealed places, in which it is best to err on the
side of completion; and in the carrying round of string courses, and
other such continuous work; not but that they may stop sometimes, on the
point of going into some palpably impenetrable recess, but then let them
stop boldly and markedly, on some distinct terminal ornament, and never
be supposed to exist where they do not. The arches of the towers which
flank the transepts of Rouen Cathedral have rosette ornaments on their
spandrils, on the three visible sides; none on the side towards the
roof. The right of this is rather a nice point for question.

    [G] Mod. Painters, Part I. Sec. 1, Chap. 3.

XII. Visibility, however, we must remember, depends, not only on
situation, but on distance; and there is no way in which work is more
painfully and unwisely lost than in its over delicacy on parts distant
from the eye. Here, again, the principle of honesty must govern our
treatment: we must not work any kind of ornament which is, perhaps, to
cover the whole building (or at least to occur on all parts of it)
delicately where it is near the eye, and rudely where it is removed from
it. That is trickery and dishonesty. Consider, first, what kinds of
ornaments will tell in the distance and what near, and so distribute
them, keeping such as by their nature are delicate, down near the eye,
and throwing the bold and rough kinds of work to the top; and if there
be any kind which is to be both near and far off, take care that it be
as boldly and rudely wrought where it is well seen as where it is
distant, so that the spectator may know exactly what it is, and what it
is worth. Thus chequered patterns, and in general such ornaments as
common workmen can execute, may extend over the whole building; but
bas-reliefs, and fine niches and capitals, should be kept down, and the
common sense of this will always give a building dignity, even though
there be some abruptness or awkwardness, in the resulting arrangements.
Thus at San Zeno at Verona, the bas-reliefs, full of incident and
interest are confined to a parallelogram of the front, reaching to the
height of the capitals of the columns of the porch. Above these, we find
a simple though most lovely, little arcade; and above that, only blank
wall, with square face shafts. The whole effect is tenfold grander and
better than if the entire façade had been covered with bad work, and may
serve for an example of the way to place little where we cannot afford
much. So, again, the transept gates of Rouen[H] are covered with
delicate bas-reliefs (of which I shall speak at greater length
presently) up to about once and a half a man's height; and above that
come the usual and more visible statues and niches. So in the campanile
at Florence, the circuit of bas-reliefs is on its lowest story; above
that come its statues; and above them all its pattern mosaic, and
twisted columns, exquisitely finished, like all Italian work of the
time, but still, in the eye of the Florentine, rough and commonplace by
comparison with the bas-reliefs. So generally the most delicate niche
work and best mouldings of the French Gothic are in gates and low
windows well within sight; although, it being the very spirit of that
style to trust to its exuberance for effect, there is occasionally a
burst upwards and blossoming unrestrainably to the sky, as in the
pediment of the west front of Rouen, and in the recess of the rose
window behind it, where there are some most elaborate flower-mouldings,
all but invisible from below, and only adding a general enrichment to
the deep shadows that relieve the shafts of the advanced pediment. It is
observable, however, that this very work is bad flamboyant, and has
corrupt renaissance characters in its detail as well as use; while in
the earlier and grander north and south gates, there is a very noble
proportioning of the work to the distance, the niches and statues which
crown the northern one, at a height of about one hundred feet from the
ground, being alike colossal and simple; visibly so from below, so as to
induce no deception, and yet honestly and well-finished above, and all
that they are expected to be; the features very beautiful, full of
expression, and as delicately wrought as any work of the period.

    [H] Henceforward, for the sake of convenience, when I name any
    cathedral town in this manner, let me be understood to speak of its
    cathedral church.

XIII. It is to be remembered, however, that while the ornaments in every
fine ancient building, without exception so far as I am aware, are most
delicate at the base, they are often in greater effective _quantity_ on
the upper parts. In high towers this is perfectly natural and right, the
solidity of the foundation being as necessary as the division and
penetration of the superstructure; hence the lighter work and richly
pierced crowns of late Gothic towers. The campanile of Giotto at
Florence, already alluded to, is an exquisite instance of the union of
the two principles, delicate bas-reliefs adorning its massy foundation,
while the open tracery of the upper windows attracts the eye by its
slender intricacy, and a rich cornice crowns the whole. In such truly
fine cases of this disposition the upper work is effective by its
quantity and intricacy only, as the lower portions by delicacy; so also
in the Tour de Beurre at Rouen, where, however, the detail is massy
throughout, subdividing into rich meshes as it ascends. In the bodies of
buildings the principle is less safe, but its discussion is not
connected with our present subject.

XIV. Finally, work may be wasted by being too good for its material, or
too fine to bear exposure; and this, generally a characteristic of late,
especially of renaissance, work, is perhaps the worst fault of all. I do
not know anything more painful or pitiful than the kind of ivory carving
with which the Certosa of Pavia, and part of the Colleone sepulchral
chapel at Bergamo, and other such buildings, are incrusted, of which it
is not possible so much as to think without exhaustion; and a heavy
sense of the misery it would be, to be forced to look at it at all. And
this is not from the quantity of it, nor because it is bad work--much of
it is inventive and able; but because it looks as if it were only fit to
be put in inlaid cabinets and velveted caskets, and as if it could not
bear one drifting shower or gnawing frost. We are afraid for it, anxious
about it, and tormented by it; and we feel that a massy shaft and a bold
shadow would be worth it all. Nevertheless, even in cases like these,
much depends on the accomplishment of the great ends of decoration. If
the ornament does its duty--if it _is_ ornament, and its points of shade
and light tell in the general effect, we shall not be offended by
finding that the sculptor in his fulness of fancy has chosen to give
much more than these mere points of light, and has composed them of
groups of figures. But if the ornament does not answer its purpose, if
it have no distant, no truly decorative power; if generally seen it be a
mere incrustation and meaningless roughness, we shall only be chagrined
by finding when we look close, that the incrustation has cost years of
labor and has millions of figures and histories in it and would be
the better of being seen through a Stanhope lens. Hence the greatness of
the northern Gothic as contrasted with the latest Italian. It reaches
nearly the same extreme of detail; but it never loses sight of its
architectural purpose, never fails in its decorative power; not a
leaflet in it but speaks, and speaks far off, too; and so long as this
be the case, there is no limit to the luxuriance in which such work may
legitimately and nobly be bestowed.

  [Illustration: PLATE I.--(Page 33--Vol. V)
  ORNAMENTS FROM ROUEN, ST. LO, AND VENICE.]

XV. No limit: it is one of the affectations of architects to speak of
overcharged ornament. Ornament cannot be overcharged if it be good, and
is always overcharged when it is bad. I have given, on the opposite page
(fig. 1), one of the smallest niches of the central gate of Rouen. That
gate I suppose to be the most exquisite piece of pure flamboyant work
existing; for though I have spoken of the upper portions, especially the
receding window, as degenerate, the gate itself is of a purer period,
and has hardly any renaissance taint. There are four strings of these
niches (each with two figures beneath it) round the porch, from the
ground to the top of the arch, with three intermediate rows of larger
niches, far more elaborate; besides the six principal canopies of each
outer pier. The total number of the subordinate niches alone, each
worked like that in the plate, and each with a different pattern of
traceries in each compartment, is one hundred and seventy-six.[4] Yet in
all this ornament there is not one cusp, one finial that is useless--not
a stroke of the chisel is in vain; the grace and luxuriance of it all
are visible--sensible rather--even to the uninquiring eye; and all its
minuteness does not diminish the majesty, while it increases the
mystery, of the noble and unbroken vault. It is not less the boast of
some styles that they can bear ornament, than of others that they can do
without it; but we do not often enough reflect that those very styles,
of so haughty simplicity, owe part of their pleasurableness to contrast,
and would be wearisome if universal. They are but the rests and
monotones of the art; it is to its far happier, far higher, exaltation
that we owe those fair fronts of variegated mosaic, charged with wild
fancies and dark hosts of imagery, thicker and quainter than ever
filled the depth of midsummer dream; those vaulted gates, trellised with
close leaves; those window-labyrinths of twisted tracery and starry
light; those misty masses of multitudinous pinnacle and diademed tower;
the only witnesses, perhaps that remain to us of the faith and fear of
nations. All else for which the builders sacrificed, has passed
away--all their living interests, and aims, and achievements. We know
not for what they labored, and we see no evidence of their reward.
Victory, wealth, authority, happiness--all have departed, though bought
by many a bitter sacrifice. But of them, and their life, and their toil
upon the earth, one reward, one evidence, is left to us in those gray
heaps of deep-wrought stone. They have taken with them to the grave
their powers, their honors, and their errors; but they have left us
their adoration.




CHAPTER II.

THE LAMP OF TRUTH.


I. There is a marked likeness between the virtues of man and the
enlightenment of the globe he inhabits--the same diminishing gradation
in vigor up to the limits of their domains, the same essential
separation from their contraries--the same twilight at the meeting of
the two: a something wider belt than the line where the world rolls into
night, that strange twilight of the virtues; that dusky debateable land,
wherein zeal becomes impatience, and temperance becomes severity, and
justice becomes cruelty, and faith superstition, and each and all vanish
into gloom.

Nevertheless, with the greater number of them, though their dimness
increases gradually, we may mark the moment of their sunset; and,
happily, may turn the shadow back by the way by which it had gone down:
but for one, the line of the horizon is irregular and undefined; and
this, too, the very equator and girdle of them all--Truth; that only one
of which there are no degrees, but breaks and rents continually; that
pillar of the earth, yet a cloudy pillar; that golden and narrow line,
which the very powers and virtues that lean upon it bend, which policy
and prudence conceal, which kindness and courtesy modify, which courage
overshadows with his shield, imagination covers with her wings, and
charity dims with her tears. How difficult must the maintenance of that
authority be, which, while it has to restrain the hostility of all the
worst principles of man, has also to restrain the disorders of his
best--which is continually assaulted by the one, and betrayed by the
other, and which regards with the same severity the lightest and the
boldest violations of its law! There are some faults slight in the sight
of love, some errors slight in the estimate of wisdom; but truth
forgives no insult, and endures no stain.

We do not enough consider this; nor enough dread the slight and
continual occasions of offence against her. We are too much in the habit
of looking at falsehood in its darkest associations, and through the
color of its worst purposes. That indignation which we profess to feel
at deceit absolute, is indeed only at deceit malicious. We resent
calumny, hypocrisy and treachery, because they harm us, not because they
are untrue. Take the detraction and the mischief from the untruth, and
we are little offended by it; turn it into praise, and we may be pleased
with it. And yet it is not calumny nor treachery that does the largest
sum of mischief in the world; they are continually crushed, and are felt
only in being conquered. But it is the glistening and softly spoken lie;
the amiable fallacy; the patriotic lie of the historian, the provident
lie of the politician, the zealous lie of the partizan, the merciful lie
of the friend, and the careless lie of each man to himself, that cast
that black mystery over humanity, through which any man who pierces, we
thank as we would thank one who dug a well in a desert; happy in that
the thirst for truth still remains with us, even when we have wilfully
left the fountains of it.

It would be well if moralists less frequently confused the greatness of
a sin with its unpardonableness. The two characters are altogether
distinct. The greatness of a fault depends partly on the nature of the
person against whom it is committed, partly upon the extent of its
consequences. Its pardonableness depends, humanly speaking, on the
degree of temptation to it. One class of circumstances determines the
weight of the attaching punishment; the other, the claim to remission of
punishment: and since it is not easy for men to estimate the relative
weight, nor possible for them to know the relative consequences, of
crime, it is usually wise in them to quit the care of such nice
measurements, and to look to the other and clearer condition of
culpability; esteeming those faults worst which are committed under
least temptation. I do not mean to diminish the blame of the injurious
and malicious sin, of the selfish and deliberate falsity; yet it seems
to me, that the shortest way to check the darker forms of deceit is to
set watch more scrupulous against those which have mingled, unregarded
and unchastised, with the current of our life. Do not let us lie at all.
Do not think of one falsity as harmless, and another as slight, and
another as unintended. Cast them all aside: they may be light and
accidental; but they are an ugly soot from the smoke of the pit, for all
that; and it is better that our hearts should be swept clean of them,
without over care as to which is largest or blackest. Speaking truth is
like writing fair, and comes only by practice; it is less a matter of
will than of habit, and I doubt if any occasion can be trivial which
permits the practice and formation of such a habit. To speak and act
truth with constancy and precision is nearly as difficult, and perhaps
as meritorious, as to speak it under intimidation or penalty; and it is
a strange thought how many men there are, as I trust, who would hold to
it at the cost of fortune or life, for one who would hold to it at the
cost of a little daily trouble. And seeing that of all sin there is,
perhaps, no one more flatly opposite to the Almighty, no one more
"wanting the good of virtue and of being," than this of lying, it is
surely a strange insolence to fall into the foulness of it on light or
on no temptation, and surely becoming an honorable man to resolve that,
whatever semblances or fallacies the necessary course of his life may
compel him to bear or to believe, none shall disturb the serenity of his
voluntary actions, nor diminish the reality of his chosen delights.

II. If this be just and wise for truth's sake, much more is it necessary
for the sake of the delights over which she has influence. For, as I
advocated the expression of the Spirit of Sacrifice in the acts and
pleasures of men, not as if thereby those acts could further the cause
of religion, but because most assuredly they might therein be infinitely
ennobled themselves, so I would have the Spirit or Lamp of Truth clear
in the hearts of our artists and handicraftsmen, not as if the truthful
practice of handicrafts could far advance the cause of truth, but
because I would fain see the handicrafts themselves urged by the spurs
of chivalry: and it is, indeed, marvellous to see what power and
universality there is in this single principle, and how in the
consulting or forgetting of it lies half the dignity or decline of every
art and act of man. I have before endeavored to show its range and power
in painting; and I believe a volume, instead of a chapter, might be
written on its authority over all that is great in architecture. But I
must be content with the force of instances few and familiar, believing
that the occasions of its manifestation may be more easily discovered by
a desire to be true, than embraced by an analysis of truth.

Only it is very necessary in the outset to mark clearly wherein consists
the essence of fallacy as distinguished from supposition.

III. For it might be at first thought that the whole kingdom of
imagination was one of deception also. Not so: the action of the
imagination is a voluntary summoning of the conceptions of things absent
or impossible; and the pleasure and nobility of the imagination partly
consist in its knowledge and contemplation of them as such, i.e. in the
knowledge of their actual absence or impossibility at the moment of
their apparent presence or reality. When the imagination deceives it
becomes madness. It is a noble faculty so long as it confesses its own
ideality; when it ceases to confess this, it is insanity. All the
difference lies in the fact of the confession, in there being _no_
deception. It is necessary to our rank as spiritual creatures, that we
should be able to invent and to behold what is not; and to our rank as
moral creatures that we should know and confess at the same time that
it is not.

IV. Again, it might be thought, and has been thought, that the whole art
of painting is nothing else than an endeavor to deceive. Not so: it is,
on the contrary, a statement of certain facts, in the clearest possible
way. For instance: I desire to give an account of a mountain or of a
rock; I begin by telling its shape. But words will not do this
distinctly, and I draw its shape, and say, "This was its shape." Next: I
would fain represent its color; but words will not do this either, and I
dye the paper, and say, "This was its color." Such a process may be
carried on until the scene appears to exist, and a high pleasure may be
taken in its apparent existence. This is a communicated act of
imagination, but no lie. The lie can consist only in an _assertion_ of
its existence (which is never for one instant made, implied, or
believed), or else in false statements of forms and colors (which are,
indeed, made and believed to our great loss, continually). And observe,
also, that so degrading a thing is deception in even the approach and
appearance of it, that all painting which even reaches the mark of
apparent realization, is degraded in so doing. I have enough insisted on
this point in another place.

V. The violations of truth, which dishonor poetry and painting, are thus
for the most part confined to the treatment of their subjects. But in
architecture another and a less subtle, more contemptible, violation of
truth is possible; a direct falsity of assertion respecting the nature
of material, or the quantity of labor. And this is, in the full sense of
the word, wrong; it is as truly deserving of reprobation as any other
moral delinquency; it is unworthy alike of architects and of nations;
and it has been a sign, wherever it has widely and with toleration
existed, of a singular debasement of the arts; that it is not a sign of
worse than this, of a general want of severe probity, can be accounted
for only by our knowledge of the strange separation which has for some
centuries existed between the arts and all other subjects of human
intellect, as matters of conscience. This withdrawal of
conscientiousness from among the faculties concerned with art, while it
has destroyed the arts themselves, has also rendered in a measure
nugatory the evidence which otherwise they might have presented
respecting the character of the respective nations among whom they have
been cultivated; otherwise, it might appear more than strange that a
nation so distinguished for its general uprightness and faith as the
English, should admit in their architecture more of pretence,
concealment, and deceit, than any other of this or of past time.

They are admitted in thoughtlessness, but with fatal effect upon the art
in which they are practised. If there were no other causes for the
failures which of late have marked every great occasion for
architectural exertion, these petty dishonesties would be enough to
account for all. It is the first step and not the least, towards
greatness to do away with these; the first, because so evidently and
easily in our power. We may not be able to command good, or beautiful,
or inventive architecture; but we _can_ command an honest architecture:
the meagreness of poverty may be pardoned, the sternness of utility
respected; but what is there but scorn for the meanness of deception?

VI. Architectural Deceits are broadly to be considered under three
heads:--

1st. The suggestion of a mode of structure or support, other than the
true one; as in pendants of late Gothic roofs.

2d. The painting of surfaces to represent some other material than that
of which they actually consist (as in the marbling of wood), or the
deceptive representation of sculptured ornament upon them.

3d. The use of cast or machine-made ornaments of any kind.

Now, it may be broadly stated, that architecture will be noble exactly
in the degree in which all these false expedients are avoided.
Nevertheless, there are certain degrees of them, which, owing to their
frequent usage, or to other causes, have so far lost the nature of
deceit as to be admissible; as, for instance, gilding, which is in
architecture no deceit, because it is therein not understood for gold;
while in jewellery it is a deceit, because it is so understood, and
therefore altogether to be reprehended. So that there arise, in the
application of the strict rules of right, many exceptions and niceties
of conscience; which let us as briefly as possible examine.

VII. 1st. Structural Deceits. I have limited these to the determined and
purposed suggestion of a mode of support other than the true one. The
architect is not _bound_ to exhibit structure; nor are we to complain of
him for concealing it, any more than we should regret that the outer
surfaces of the human frame conceal much of its anatomy; nevertheless,
that building will generally be the noblest, which to an intelligent eye
discovers the great secrets of its structure, as an animal form does,
although from a careless observer they may be concealed. In the vaulting
of a Gothic roof it is no deceit to throw the strength into the ribs of
it, and make the intermediate vault a mere shell. Such a structure would
be presumed by an intelligent observer, the first time he saw such a
roof; and the beauty of its traceries would be enhanced to him if they
confessed and followed the lines of its main strength. If, however, the
intermediate shell were made of wood instead of stone, and whitewashed
to look like the rest,--this would, of course, be direct deceit, and
altogether unpardonable.

There is, however, a certain deception necessarily occurring in Gothic
architecture, which relates, not to the points, but to the manner, of
support. The resemblance in its shafts and ribs to the external
relations of stems and branches, which has been the ground of so much
foolish speculation, necessarily induces in the mind of the spectator a
sense or belief of a correspondent internal structure; that is to say,
of a fibrous and continuous strength from the root into the limbs, and
an elasticity communicated _upwards,_ sufficient for the support of the
ramified portions. The idea of the real conditions, of a great weight of
ceiling thrown upon certain narrow, jointed lines, which have a tendency
partly to be crushed, and partly to separate and be pushed outwards, is
with difficulty received; and the more so when the pillars would be, if
unassisted, too slight for the weight, and are supported by external
flying buttresses, as in the apse of Beauvais, and other such
achievements of the bolder Gothic. Now, there is a nice question of
conscience in this, which we shall hardly settle but by considering
that, when the mind is informed beyond the possibility of mistake as to
the true nature of things, the affecting it with a contrary impression,
however distinct, is no dishonesty, but on the contrary, a legitimate
appeal to the imagination. For instance, the greater part of the
happiness which we have in contemplating clouds, results from the
impression of their having massive, luminous, warm, and mountain-like
surfaces; and our delight in the sky frequently depends upon our
considering it as a blue vault. But we know the contrary, in both
instances; we know the cloud to be a damp fog, or a drift of snow
flakes; and the sky to be a lightless abyss. There is, therefore, no
dishonesty, while there is much delight, in the irresistibly contrary
impression. In the same way, so long as we see the stones and joints,
and are not deceived as to the points of support in any piece of
architecture, we may rather praise than regret the dextrous artifices
which compel us to feel as if there were fibre in its shafts and life in
its branches. Nor is even the concealment of the support of the external
buttress reprehensible, so long as the pillars are not sensibly
inadequate to their duty. For the weight of a roof is a circumstance of
which the spectator generally has no idea, and the provisions for it,
consequently, circumstances whose necessity or adaptation he could not
understand. It is no deceit, therefore, when the weight to be borne is
necessarily unknown, to conceal also the means of bearing it, leaving
only to be perceived so much of the support as is indeed adequate to the
weight supposed. For the shafts do, indeed, bear as much as they are
ever imagined to bear, and the system of added support is no more, as a
matter of conscience, to be exhibited, than, in the human or any other
form, mechanical provisions for those functions which are themselves
unperceived.

But the moment that the conditions of weight are comprehended, both
truth and feeling require that the conditions of support should be also
comprehended. Nothing can be worse, either as judged by the taste or the
conscience, than affectedly inadequate supports--suspensions in air,
and other such tricks and vanities. Mr. Hope wisely reprehends, for this
reason, the arrangement of the main piers of St. Sophia at
Constantinople. King's College Chapel, Cambridge, is a piece of
architectural juggling, if possible still more to be condemned, because
less sublime.

VIII. With deceptive concealments of structure are to be classed, though
still more blameable, deceptive assumptions of it--the introduction of
members which should have, or profess to have, a duty, and have none.
One of the most general instances of this will be found in the form of
the flying buttress in late Gothic. The use of that member is, of
course, to convey support from one pier to another when the plan of the
building renders it necessary or desirable that the supporting masses
should be divided into groups, the most frequent necessity of this kind
arising from the intermediate range of chapels or aisles between the
nave or choir walls and their supporting piers. The natural, healthy,
and beautiful arrangement is that of a steeply sloping bar of stone,
sustained by an arch with its spandril carried farthest down on the
lowest side, and dying into the vertical of the outer pier; that pier
being, of course, not square, but rather a piece of wall set at right
angles to the supported walls, and, if need be, crowned by a pinnacle to
give it greater weight. The whole arrangement is exquisitely carried out
in the choir of Beauvais. In later Gothic the pinnacle became gradually
a decorative member, and was used in all places merely for the sake of
its beauty. There is no objection to this; it is just as lawful to build
a pinnacle for its beauty as a tower; but also the buttress became a
decorative member; and was used, first, where it was not wanted, and,
secondly, in forms in which it could be of no use, becoming a mere tie,
not between the pier and wall, but between the wall and the top of the
decorative pinnacle, thus attaching itself to the very point where its
thrust, if it made any, could not be resisted. The most flagrant
instance of this barbarism that I remember (though it prevails partially
in all the spires of the Netherlands), is the lantern of St. Ouen at
Rouen, where the pierced buttress, having an ogee curve, looks about as
much calculated to bear a thrust as a switch of willow; and the
pinnacles, huge and richly decorated, have evidently no work to do
whatsoever, but stand round the central tower, like four idle servants,
as they are--heraldic supporters, that central tower being merely a
hollow crown, which needs no more buttressing than a basket does. In
fact, I do not know anything more strange or unwise than the praise
lavished upon this lantern; it is one of the basest pieces of Gothic in
Europe; its flamboyant traceries of the last and most degraded forms;[5]
and its entire plan and decoration resembling, and deserving little more
credit than, the burnt sugar ornaments of elaborate confectionery. There
are hardly any of the magnificent and serene constructions of the early
Gothic which have not, in the course of time, been gradually thinned and
pared away into these skeletons, which sometimes indeed, when their
lines truly follow the structure of the original masses, have an
interest like that of the fibrous framework of leaves from which the
substance has been dissolved, but which are usually distorted as well as
emaciated, and remain but the sickly phantoms and mockeries of things
that were; they are to true architecture what the Greek ghost was to the
armed and living frame; and the very winds that whistle through the
threads of them, are to the diapasoned echoes of the ancient walls, as
to the voice of the man was the pining of the spectre.[6]

IX. Perhaps the most fruitful source of these kinds of corruption which
we have to guard against in recent times, is one which, nevertheless,
comes in a "questionable shape," and of which it is not easy to
determine the proper laws and limits; I mean the use of iron. The
definition of the art of architecture, given in the first chapter, is
independent of its materials: nevertheless, that art having been, up to
the beginning of the present century, practised for the most part in
clay, stone, or wood, it has resulted that the sense of proportion and
the laws of structure have been based, the one altogether, the other in
great part, on the necessities consequent on the employment of those
materials; and that the entire or principal employment of metallic
framework would, therefore, be generally felt as a departure from the
first principles of the art. Abstractedly there appears no reason why
iron should not be used as well as wood; and the time is probably near
when a new system of architectural laws will be developed, adapted
entirely to metallic construction. But I believe that the tendency of
all present sympathy and association is to limit the idea of
architecture to non-metallic work; and that not without reason. For
architecture being in its perfection the earliest, as in its elements it
is necessarily the first, of arts, will always precede, in any barbarous
nation, the possession of the science necessary either for the obtaining
or the management of iron. Its first existence and its earliest laws
must, therefore, depend upon the use of materials accessible in
quantity, and on the surface of the earth; that is to say, clay, wood,
or stone: and as I think it cannot but be generally felt that one of the
chief dignities of architecture is its historical use; and since the
latter is partly dependent on consistency of style, it will be felt
right to retain as far as may be, even in periods of more advanced
science, the materials and principles of earlier ages.

X. But whether this be granted me or not, the fact is, that every idea
respecting size, proportion, decoration, or construction, on which we
are at present in the habit of acting or judging, depends on
presupposition of such materials: and as I both feel myself unable to
escape the influence of these prejudices, and believe that my readers
will be equally so, it may be perhaps permitted to me to assume that
true architecture does not admit iron as a constructive material,[7] and
that such works as the cast-iron central spire of Rouen Cathedral, or
the iron roofs and pillars of our railway stations, and of some of our
churches, are not architecture at all. Yet it is evident that metals
may, and sometimes must, enter into the construction to a certain
extent, as nails in wooden architecture, and therefore as legitimately
rivets and solderings in stone; neither can we well deny to the Gothic
architect the power of supporting statues, pinnacles, or traceries by
iron bars; and if we grant this I do not see how we can help allowing
Brunelleschi his iron chain around the dome of Florence, or the builders
of Salisbury their elaborate iron binding of the central tower.[8] If,
however, we would not fall into the old sophistry of the grains of corn
and the heap, we must find a rule which may enable us to stop somewhere.
This rule is, I think, that metals may be used as a _cement_ but not as
a _support_. For as cements of other kinds are often so strong that the
stones may easier be broken than separated, and the wall becomes a solid
mass without for that reason losing the character of architecture, there
is no reason why, when a nation has obtained the knowledge and practice
of iron work, metal rods or rivets should not be used in the place of
cement, and establish the same or a greater strength and adherence,
without in any wise inducing departure from the types and system of
architecture before established; nor does it make any difference except
as to sightliness, whether the metal bands or rods so employed, be in
the body of the wall or on its exterior, or set as stays and
cross-bands; so only that the use of them be always and distinctly one
which might be superseded by mere strength of cement; as for instance if
a pinnacle or mullion be propped or tied by an iron band, it is evident
that the iron only prevents the separation of the stones by lateral
force, which the cement would have done, had it been strong enough. But
the moment that the iron in the least degree takes the place of the
stone, and acts by its resistance to crushing, and bears superincumbent
weight, or if it acts by its own weight as a counterpoise, and so
supersedes the use of pinnacles or buttresses in resisting a lateral
thrust, or if, in the form of a rod or girder, it is used to do what
wooden beams would have done as well, that instant the building ceases,
so far as such applications of metal extend, to be true architecture.

XI. The limit, however, thus determined, is an ultimate one, and it is
well in all things to be cautious how we approach the utmost limit of
lawfulness; so that, although the employment of metal within this limit
cannot be considered as destroying the very being and nature of
architecture, it will, if, extravagant and frequent, derogate from the
dignity of the work, as well as (which is especially to our present
point) from its honesty. For although the spectator is not informed as
to the quantity or strength of the cement employed, he will generally
conceive the stones of the building to be separable and his estimate of
the skill of the architect will be based in a great measure on his
supposition of this condition, and of the difficulties attendant upon
it: so that it is always more honorable, and it has a tendency to render
the style of architecture both more masculine and more scientific, to
employ stone and mortar simply as such, and to do as much as possible
with the weight of the one and the strength of the other, and rather
sometimes to forego a grace, or to confess a weakness, than attain the
one, or conceal the other, by means verging upon dishonesty.

Nevertheless, where the design is of such delicacy and slightness as, in
some parts of very fair and finished edifices, it is desirable that it
should be; and where both its completion and security are in a measure
dependent on the use of metal, let not such use be reprehended; so only
that as much is done as may be, by good mortar and good masonry; and no
slovenly workmanship admitted through confidence in the iron helps; for
it is in this license as in that of wine, a man may use it for his
infirmities, but not for his nourishment.

XII. And, in order to avoid an over use of this liberty, it would be
well to consider what application may be conveniently made of the
dovetailing and various adjusting of stones; for when any artifice is
necessary to help the mortar, certainly this ought to come before the
use of metal, for it is both safer and more honest. I cannot see that
any objection can be made to the fitting of the stones in any shapes the
architect pleases: for although it would not be desirable to see
buildings put together like Chinese puzzles, there must always be a
check upon such an abuse of the practice in its difficulty; nor is it
necessary that it should be always exhibited, so that it be understood
by the spectator as an admitted help, and that no principal stones are
introduced in positions apparently impossible for them to retain,
although a riddle here and there, in unimportant features, may sometimes
serve to draw the eye to the masonry, and make it interesting, as well
as to give a delightful sense of a kind of necromantic power in the
architect. There is a pretty one in the lintel of the lateral door of
the cathedral of Prato (Plate IV. fig. 4.); where the maintenance of
the visibly separate stones, alternate marble and serpentine, cannot be
understood until their cross-cutting is seen below. Each block is, of
course, of the form given in fig. 5.

XIII. Lastly, before leaving the subject of structural deceits, I would
remind the architect who thinks that I am unnecessarily and narrowly
limiting his resources or his art, that the highest greatness and the
highest wisdom are shown, the first by a noble submission to, the second
by a thoughtful providence for, certain voluntarily admitted restraints.
Nothing is more evident than this, in that supreme government which is
the example, as it is the centre, of all others. The Divine Wisdom is,
and can be, shown to us only in its meeting and contending with the
difficulties which are voluntarily, and _for the sake of that contest_,
admitted by the Divine Omnipotence: and these difficulties, observe,
occur in the form of natural laws or ordinances, which might, at many
times and in countless ways, be infringed with apparent advantage, but
which are never infringed, whatever costly arrangements or adaptations
their observance may necessitate for the accomplishment of given
purposes. The example most apposite to our present subject is the
structure of the bones of animals. No reason can be given, I believe,
why the system of the higher animals should not have been made capable,
as that of the _Infusoria_ is, of secreting flint, instead of phosphate
of lime, or more naturally still, carbon; so framing the bones of
adamant at once. The elephant or rhinoceros, had the earthy part of
their bones been made of diamond, might have been as agile and light as
grasshoppers, and other animals might have been framed far more
magnificently colossal than any that walk the earth. In other worlds we
may, perhaps, see such creations; a creation for every element, and
elements infinite. But the architecture of animals _here_, is appointed
by God to be a marble architecture, not a flint nor adamant
architecture; and all manner of expedients are adopted to attain the
utmost degree of strength and size possible under that great limitation.
The jaw of the ichthyosaurus is pieced and riveted, the leg of the
megatherium is a foot thick, and the head of the myodon has a double
skull; we, in our wisdom, should, doubtless, have given the lizard a
steel jaw, and the myodon a cast-iron headpiece, and forgotten the great
principle to which all creation bears witness, that order and system are
nobler things than power. But God shows us in Himself, strange as it may
seem, not only authoritative perfection, but even the perfection of
Obedience--an obedience to His own laws: and in the cumbrous movement of
those unwieldiest of His creatures we are reminded, even in His divine
essence, of that attribute of uprightness in the human creature "that
sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not."

XIV. 2d. Surface Deceits. These may be generally defined as the inducing
the supposition of some form or material which does not actually exist;
as commonly in the painting of wood to represent marble, or in the
painting of ornaments in deceptive relief, &c. But we must be careful to
observe, that the evil of them consists always in definitely attempted
_deception_, and that it is a matter of some nicety to mark the point
where deception begins or ends.

Thus, for instance, the roof of Milan Cathedral is seemingly covered
with elaborate fan tracery, forcibly enough painted to enable it, in its
dark and removed position, to deceive a careless observer. This is, of
course, gross degradation; it destroys much of the dignity even of the
rest of the building, and is in the very strongest terms to be
reprehended.

The roof of the Sistine Chapel has much architectural design in
grissaille mingled with the figures of its frescoes; and the effect is
increase of dignity.

In what lies the distinctive character?

In two points, principally:--First. That the architecture is so closely
associated with the figures, and has so grand fellowship with them in
its forms and cast shadows, that both are at once felt to be of a piece;
and as the figures must necessarily be painted, the architecture is
known to be so too. There is thus no deception.

Second. That so great a painter as Michael Angelo would always stop
short in such minor parts of his design, of the degree of vulgar force
which would be necessary to induce the supposition of their reality;
and, strangely as it may sound, would never paint badly enough to
deceive.

But though right and wrong are thus found broadly opposed in works
severally so mean and so mighty as the roof of Milan and that of the
Sistine, there are works neither so great nor so mean, in which the
limits of right are vaguely defined, and will need some care to
determine; care only, however, to apply accurately the broad principle
with which we set out, that no form nor material is to be _deceptively_
represented.

XV. Evidently, then, painting, confessedly such, is no deception: it
does not assert any material whatever. Whether it be on wood or on
stone, or, as will naturally be supposed, on plaster, does not matter.
Whatever the material, good painting makes it more precious; nor can it
ever be said to deceive respecting the ground of which it gives us no
information. To cover brick with plaster, and this plaster with fresco,
is, therefore, perfectly legitimate; and as desirable a mode of
decoration as it is constant in the great periods. Verona and Venice are
now seen deprived of more than half their former splendor; it depended
far more on their frescoes than their marbles. The plaster, in this
case, is to be considered as the gesso ground on panel or canvas. But to
cover brick with cement, and to divide this cement with joints that it
may look like stone, is to tell a falsehood; and is just as contemptible
a procedure as the other is noble.

It being lawful to paint then, is it lawful to paint everything? So long
as the painting is confessed--yes; but if, even in the slightest degree,
the sense of it be lost, and the thing painted be supposed real--no. Let
us take a few instances. In the Campo Santo at Pisa, each fresco is
surrounded with a border composed of flat colored patterns of great
elegance--no part of it in attempted relief. The certainty of flat
surface being thus secured, the figures, though the size of life, do not
deceive, and the artist thenceforward is at liberty to put forth his
whole power, and to lead us through fields and groves, and depths of
pleasant landscape, and to soothe us with the sweet clearness of far off
sky, and yet never lose the severity of his primal purpose of
architectural decoration.

In the Camera di Correggio of San Lodovico at Parma, the trellises of
vine shadow the walls, as if with an actual arbor; and the troops of
children, peeping through the oval openings, luscious in color and faint
in light, may well be expected every instant to break through, or hide
behind the covert. The grace of their attitudes, and the evident
greatness of the whole work, mark that it is painting, and barely redeem
it from the charge of falsehood; but even so saved, it is utterly
unworthy to take a place among noble or legitimate architectural
decoration.

In the cupola of the duomo of Parma the same painter has represented the
Assumption with so much deceptive power, that he has made a dome of some
thirty feet diameter look like a cloud-wrapt opening in the seventh
heaven, crowded with a rushing sea of angels. Is this wrong? Not so: for
the subject at once precludes the possibility of deception. We might
have taken the vines for a veritable pergoda, and the children for its
haunting ragazzi; but we know the stayed clouds and moveless angels must
be man's work; let him put his utmost strength to it and welcome, he can
enchant us, but cannot betray.

We may thus apply the rule to the highest, as well as the art of daily
occurrence, always remembering that more is to be forgiven to the great
painter than to the mere decorative workman; and this especially,
because the former, even in deceptive portions, will not trick us so
grossly; as we have just seen in Correggio, where a worse painter would
have made the thing look like life at once. There is, however, in room,
villa, or garden decoration, some fitting admission of trickeries of
this kind, as of pictured landscapes at the extremities of alleys and
arcades, and ceilings like skies, or painted with prolongations upwards
of the architecture of the walls, which things have sometimes a certain
luxury and pleasureableness in places meant for idleness, and are
innocent enough as long as they are regarded as mere toys.

XVI. Touching the false representation of material, the question is
infinitely more simple, and the law more sweeping; all such imitations
are utterly base and inadmissible. It is melancholy to think of the time
and expense lost in marbling the shop fronts of London alone, and of the
waste of our resources in absolute vanities, in things about which no
mortal cares, by which no eye is ever arrested, unless painfully, and
which do not add one whit to comfort or cleanliness, or even to that
great object of commercial art--conspicuousness. But in architecture of
a higher rank, how much more is it to be condemned? I have made it a
rule in the present work not to blame specifically; but I may, perhaps,
be permitted, while I express my sincere admiration of the very noble
entrance and general architecture of the British Museum, to express also
my regret that the noble granite foundation of the staircase should be
mocked at its landing by an imitation, the more blameable because
tolerably successful. The only effect of it is to cast a suspicion upon
the true stones below, and upon every bit of granite afterwards
encountered. One feels a doubt, after it, of the honesty of Memnon
himself. But even this, however derogatory to the noble architecture
around it, is less painful than the want of feeling with which, in our
cheap modern churches, we suffer the wall decorator to erect about the
altar frameworks and pediments daubed with mottled color, and to dye in
the same fashions such skeletons or caricatures of columns as may emerge
above the pews; this is not merely bad taste; it is no unimportant or
excusable error which brings even these shadows of vanity and falsehood
into the house of prayer. The first condition which just feeling
requires in church furniture is, that it should be simple and
unaffected, not fictitious nor tawdry. It may be in our power to make it
beautiful, but let it at least be pure; and if we cannot permit much to
the architect, do not let us permit anything to the upholsterer; if we
keep to solid stone and solid wood, whitewashed, if we like, for
cleanliness' sake (for whitewash has so often been used as the dress of
noble things that it has thence received a kind of nobility itself), it
must be a bad design indeed which is grossly offensive. I recollect no
instance of a want of sacred character, or of any marked and painful
ugliness, in the simplest or the most awkwardly built village church,
where stone and wood were roughly and nakedly used, and the windows
latticed with white glass. But the smoothly stuccoed walls, the flat
roofs with ventilator ornaments, the barred windows with jaundiced
borders and dead ground square panes, the gilded or bronzed wood, the
painted iron, the wretched upholstery of curtains and cushions, and pew
heads and altar railings, and Birmingham metal candlesticks, and, above
all, the green and yellow sickness of the false marble--disguises all,
observe; falsehoods all--who are they who like these things? who defend
them? who do them? I have never spoken to any one who _did_ like them,
though to many who thought them matters of no consequence. Perhaps not
to religion (though I cannot but believe that there are many to whom, as
to myself, such things are serious obstacles to the repose of mind and
temper which should precede devotional exercises); but to the general
tone of our judgment and feeling--yes; for assuredly we shall regard,
with tolerance, if not with affection, whatever forms of material things
we have been in the habit of associating with our worship, and be little
prepared to detect or blame hypocrisy, meanness, and disguise in other
kinds of decoration when we suffer objects belonging to the most solemn
of all services to be tricked out in a fashion so fictitious and
unseemly.

XVII. Painting, however, is not the only mode in which material may be
concealed, or rather simulated; for merely to conceal is, as we have
seen, no wrong. Whitewash, for instance, though often (by no means
always) to be regretted as a concealment, is not to be blamed as a
falsity. It shows itself for what it is, and asserts nothing of what is
beneath it. Gilding has become, from its frequent use, equally innocent.
It is understood for what it is, a film merely, and is, therefore,
allowable to any extent. I do not say expedient: it is one of the most
abused means of magnificence we possess, and I much doubt whether any
use we ever make of it, balances that loss of pleasure, which, from the
frequent sight and perpetual suspicion of it, we suffer in the
contemplation of anything that is verily of gold. I think gold was
meant to be seldom seen and to be admired as a precious thing; and I
sometimes wish that truth should so far literally prevail as that all
should be gold that glittered, or rather that nothing should glitter
that was not gold. Nevertheless, nature herself does not dispense with
such semblance, but uses light for it; and I have too great a love for
old and saintly art to part with its burnished field, or radiant nimbus;
only it should be used with respect, and to express magnificence, or
sacredness, and not in lavish vanity, or in sign painting. Of its
expedience, however, any more than of that of color, it is not here the
place to speak; we are endeavoring to determine what is lawful, not what
is desirable. Of other and less common modes of disguising surface, as
of powder of lapis lazuli, or mosaic imitations of colored stones, I
need hardly speak. The rule will apply to all alike, that whatever is
pretended, is wrong; commonly enforced also by the exceeding ugliness
and insufficient appearance of such methods, as lately in the style of
renovation by which half the houses in Venice have been defaced, the
brick covered first with stucco, and this painted with zigzag veins in
imitation of alabaster. But there is one more form of architectural
fiction, which is so constant in the great periods that it needs
respectful judgment. I mean the facing of brick with precious stone.

XVIII. It is well known, that what is meant by a church's being built of
marble is, in nearly all cases, only that a veneering of marble has been
fastened on the rough brick wall, built with certain projections to
receive it; and that what appear to be massy stones, are nothing more
than external slabs.

Now, it is evident, that, in this case, the question of right is on the
same ground as in that of gilding. If it be clearly understood that a
marble facing does not pretend or imply a marble wall, there is no harm
in it; and as it is also evident that, when very precious stones are
used, as jaspers and serpentines, it must become, not only an
extravagant and vain increase of expense, but sometimes an actual
impossibility, to obtain mass of them enough to build with, there is no
resource but this of veneering; nor is there anything to be alleged
against it on the head of durability, such work having been by
experience found to last as long, and in as perfect condition, as any
kind of masonry. It is, therefore, to be considered as simply an art of
mosaic on a large scale, the ground being of brick, or any other
material; and when lovely stones are to be obtained, it is a manner
which should be thoroughly understood, and often practised.
Nevertheless, as we esteem the shaft of a column more highly for its
being of a single block, and as we do not regret the loss of substance
and value which there is in things of solid gold, silver, agate, or
ivory; so I think the walls themselves may be regarded with a more just
complacency if they are known to be all of noble substance; and that
rightly weighing the demands of the two principles of which we have
hitherto spoken--Sacrifice and Truth, we should sometimes rather spare
external ornament than diminish the unseen value and consistency of what
we do; and I believe that a better manner of design, and a more careful
and studious, if less abundant decoration would follow, upon the
consciousness of thoroughness in the substance. And, indeed, this is to
be remembered, with respect to all the points we have examined; that
while we have traced the limits of license, we have not fixed those of
that high rectitude which refuses license. It is thus true that there is
no falsity, and much beauty in the use of external color, and that it is
lawful to paint either pictures or patterns on whatever surfaces may
seem to need enrichment. But it is not less true, that such practices
are essentially unarchitectural; and while we cannot say that there is
actual danger in an over use of them, seeing that they have been
_always_ used most lavishly in the times of most noble art, yet they
divide the work into two parts and kinds, one of less durability than
the other, which dies away from it in process of ages, and leaves it,
unless it have noble qualities of its own, naked and bare. That enduring
noblesse I should, therefore, call truly architectural; and it is not
until this has been secured that the accessory power of painting may be
called in, for the delight of the immediate time; nor this, as I think,
until every resource of a more stable kind has been exhausted. The true
colors of architecture are those of natural stone, and I would fain
see these taken advantage of to the full. Every variety of hue, from
pale yellow to purple, passing through orange, red, and brown, is
entirely at our command; nearly every kind of green and gray is also
attainable: and with these, and pure white, what harmonies might we not
achieve? Of stained and variegated stone, the quantity is unlimited, the
kinds innumerable; where brighter colors are required, let glass, and
gold protected by glass, be used in mosaic--a kind of work as durable as
the solid stone, and incapable of losing its lustre by time--and let the
painter's work be reserved for the shadowed _loggia_ and inner chamber.
This is the true and faithful way of building; where this cannot be, the
device of external coloring may, indeed, be employed without dishonor;
but it must be with the warning reflection, that a time will come when
such aids must pass away, and when the building will be judged in its
lifelessness, dying the death of the dolphin. Better the less bright,
more enduring fabric. The transparent alabasters of San Miniato, and the
mosaics of St. Mark's, are more warmly filled, and more brightly
touched, by every return of morning and evening rays; while the hues of
our cathedrals have died like the iris out of the cloud; and the temples
whose azure and purple once flamed above the Grecian promontories, stand
in their faded whiteness, like snows which the sunset has left cold.

XIX. The last form of fallacy which it will be remembered we had to
deprecate, was the substitution of cast or machine work for that of the
hand, generally expressible as Operative Deceit.

There are two reasons, both weighty, against this practice; one, that
all cast and machine work is bad, as work; the other, that it is
dishonest. Of its badness, I shall speak in another place, that being
evidently no efficient reason against its use when other cannot be had.
Its dishonesty, however, which, to my mind, is of the grossest kind, is,
I think, a sufficient reason to determine absolute and unconditional
rejection of it.

Ornament, as I have often before observed, has two entirely distinct
sources of agreeableness: one, that of the abstract beauty of its
forms, which, for the present, we will suppose to be the same whether
they come from the hand or the machine; the other, the sense of human
labor and care spent upon it. How great this latter influence we may
perhaps judge, by considering that there is not a cluster of weeds
growing in any cranny of ruin which has not a beauty in all respects
_nearly_ equal, and, in some, immeasurably superior, to that of the most
elaborate sculpture of its stones: and that all our interest in the
carved work, our sense of its richness, though it is tenfold less rich
than the knots of grass beside it; of its delicacy, though it is a
thousand fold less delicate; of its admirableness, though a millionfold
less admirable; results from our consciousness of its being the work of
poor, clumsy, toilsome man. Its true delightfulness depends on our
discovering in it the record of thoughts, and intents, and trials, and
heart-breakings--of recoveries and joyfulnesses of success: all this
_can_ be traced by a practised eye; but, granting it even obscure, it is
presumed or understood; and in that is the worth of the thing, just as
much as the worth of anything else we call precious. The worth of a
diamond is simply the understanding of the time it must take to look for
it before it can be cut. It has an intrinsic value besides, which the
diamond has not (for a diamond has no more real beauty than a piece of
glass); but I do not speak of that at present; I place the two on the
same ground; and I suppose that hand-wrought ornament can no more be
generally known from machine work, than a diamond can be known from
paste; nay, that the latter may deceive, for a moment, the mason's, as
the other the jeweller's eye; and that it can be detected only by the
closest examination. Yet exactly as a woman of feeling would not wear
false jewels, so would a builder of honor disdain false ornaments. The
using of them is just as downright and inexcusable a lie. You use that
which pretends to a worth which it has not; which pretends to have cost,
and to be, what it did not, and is not; it is an imposition, a
vulgarity, an impertinence, and a sin. Down with it to the ground, grind
it to powder, leave its ragged place upon the wall, rather; you have not
paid for it, you have no business with it, you do not want it. Nobody
wants ornaments in this world, but everybody wants integrity. All the
fair devices that ever were fancied, are not worth a lie. Leave your
walls as bare as a planed board, or build them of baked mud and chopped
straw, if need be; but do not rough-cast them with falsehood.

This, then, being our general law, and I hold it for a more imperative
one than any other I have asserted; and this kind of dishonesty the
meanest, as the least necessary; for ornament is an extravagant and
inessential thing; and, therefore, if fallacious, utterly base--this, I
say, being our general law, there are, nevertheless, certain exceptions
respecting particular substances and their uses.

XX. Thus in the use of brick; since that is known to be originally
moulded, there is no reason why it should not be moulded into diverse
forms. It will never be supposed to have been cut, and therefore, will
cause no deception; it will have only the credit it deserves. In flat
countries, far from any quarry of stone, cast brick may be legitimately,
and most successfully, used in decoration, and that elaborate, and even
refined. The brick mouldings of the Palazzo Pepoli at Bologna, and those
which run round the market-place of Vercelli, are among the richest in
Italy. So also, tile and porcelain work, of which the former is
grotesquely, but successfully, employed in the domestic architecture of
France, colored tiles being inserted in the diamond spaces between the
crossing timbers; and the latter admirably in Tuscany, in external
bas-reliefs, by the Robbia family, in which works, while we cannot but
sometimes regret the useless and ill-arranged colors, we would by no
means blame the employment of a material which, whatever its defects,
excels every other in permanence, and, perhaps, requires even greater
skill in its management than marble. For it is not the material, but the
absence of the human labor, which makes the thing worthless; and a piece
of terra cotta, or of plaster of Paris, which has been wrought by human
hand, is worth all the stone in Carrara, cut by machinery. It is,
indeed, possible, and even usual, for men to sink into machines
themselves, so that even hand-work has all the characters of mechanism;
of the difference between living and dead hand-work I shall speak
presently; all that I ask at present is, what it is always in our power
to secure--the confession of what we have done, and what we have given;
so that when we use stone at all, since all stone is naturally supposed
to be carved by hand, we must not carve it by machinery; neither must we
use any artificial stone cast into shape, nor any stucco ornaments of
the color of stone, or which might in anywise be mistaken for it, as the
stucco mouldings in the cortile of the Palazzo Vecchio at Florence,
which cast a shame and suspicion over every part of the building. But
for ductile and fusible materials, as clay, iron, and bronze, since
these will usually be supposed to have been cast or stamped, it is at
our pleasure to employ them as we will; remembering that they become
precious, or otherwise, just in proportion to the hand-work upon them,
or to the clearness of their reception of the hand-work of their mould.

But I believe no cause to have been more active in the degradation of
our natural feeling for beauty, than the constant use of cast iron
ornaments. The common iron work of the middle ages was as simple as it
was effective, composed of leafage cut flat out of sheet iron, and
twisted at the workman's will. No ornaments, on the contrary, are so
cold, clumsy, and vulgar, so essentially incapable of a fine line, or
shadow, as those of cast iron; and while, on the score of truth, we can
hardly allege anything against them, since they are always
distinguishable, at a glance, from wrought and hammered work, and stand
only for what they are, yet I feel very strongly that there is no hope
of the progress of the arts of any nation which indulges in these vulgar
and cheap substitutes for real decoration. Their inefficiency and
paltriness I shall endeavor to show more conclusively in another place,
enforcing only, at present, the general conclusion that, if even honest
or allowable, they are things in which we can never take just pride or
pleasure, and must never be employed in any place wherein they might
either themselves obtain the credit of being other and better than they
are, or be associated with the downright work to which it would be a
disgrace to be found in their company.

Such are, I believe, the three principal kinds of fallacy by which
architecture is liable to be corrupted; there are, however, other and
more subtle forms of it, against which it is less easy to guard by
definite law, than by the watchfulness of a manly and unaffected spirit.
For, as it has been above noticed, there are certain kinds of deception
which extend to impressions and ideas only; of which some are, indeed,
of a noble use, as that above referred to, the arborescent look of lofty
Gothic aisles; but of which the most part have so much of legerdemain
and trickery about them, that they will lower any style in which they
considerably prevail; and they are likely to prevail when once they are
admitted, being apt to catch the fancy alike of uninventive architects
and feelingless spectators; just as mean and shallow minds are, in other
matters, delighted with the sense of over-reaching, or tickled with the
conceit of detecting the intention to over-reach; and when subtleties of
this kind are accompanied by the display of such dextrous stone-cutting,
or architectural sleight of hand, as may become, even by itself, a
subject of admiration, it is a great chance if the pursuit of them do
not gradually draw us away from all regard and care for the nobler
character of the art, and end in its total paralysis or extinction. And
against this there is no guarding, but by stern disdain of all display
of dexterity and ingenious device, and by putting the whole force of our
fancy into the arrangement of masses and forms, caring no more how these
masses and forms are wrought out, than a great painter cares which way
his pencil strikes. It would be easy to give many instances of the
danger of these tricks and vanities; but I shall confine myself to the
examination of one which has, as I think, been the cause of the fall of
Gothic architecture throughout Europe. I mean the system of
intersectional mouldings, which, on account of its great importance, and
for the sake of the general reader, I may, perhaps, be pardoned for
explaining elementarily.

XXI. I must, in the first place, however, refer to Professor Willis's
account of the origin of tracery, given in the sixth chapter of his
Architecture of the Middle Ages; since the publication of which I have
been not a little amazed to hear of any attempts made to resuscitate the
inexcusably absurd theory of its derivation from imitated vegetable
form--inexcusably, I say, because the smallest acquaintance with early
Gothic architecture would have informed the supporters of that theory of
the simple fact, that, exactly in proportion to the antiquity of the
work, the imitation of such organic forms is less, and in the earliest
examples does not exist at all. There cannot be the shadow of a
question, in the mind of a person familiarised with any single series of
consecutive examples, that tracery arose from the gradual enlargement of
the penetrations of the shield of stone which, usually supported by a
central pillar, occupied the head of early windows. Professor Willis,
perhaps, confines his observations somewhat too absolutely to the double
sub-arch. I have given, in Plate VII. fig. 2, an interesting case of
rude penetration of a high and simply trefoiled shield, from the church
of the Eremitani at Padua. But the more frequent and typical form is
that of the double sub-arch, decorated with various piercings of the
space between it and the superior arch; with a simple trefoil under a
round arch, in the Abbaye aux Hommes, Caen[9] (Plate III. fig. 1); with
a very beautifully proportioned quatrefoil, in the triforium of Eu, and
that of the choir of Lisieux; with quatrefoils, sixfoils, and septfoils,
in the transept towers of Rouen (Plate III. fig. 2); with a trefoil
awkwardly, and very small quatrefoil above, at Coutances, (Plate III.
fig. 3); then, with multiplications of the same figures, pointed or
round, giving very clumsy shapes of the intermediate stone (fig. 4, from
one of the nave chapels of Rouen, fig. 5, from one of the nave chapels
of Bayeaux), and finally, by thinning out the stony ribs, reaching
conditions like that of the glorious typical form of the clerestory of
the apse of Beauvais (fig. 6).

  TRACERIES FROM CAEN, BAYEUX, ROUEN, AND BEAVAIS.]

XXII. Now, it will be noticed that, during the whole of this process,
the attention is kept fixed on the forms of the penetrations, that is to
say, of the lights as seen from the interior, not of the intermediate
stone. All the grace of the window is in the outline of its light;
and I have drawn all these traceries as seen from within, in order to
show the effect of the light thus treated, at first in far off and
separate stars, and then gradually enlarging, approaching, until they
come and stand over us, as it were, filling the whole space with their
effulgence. And it is in this pause of the star, that we have the great,
pure, and perfect form of French Gothic; it was at the instant when the
rudeness of the intermediate space had been finally conquered, when the
light had expanded to its fullest, and yet had not lost its radiant
unity, principality, and visible first causing of the whole, that we
have the most exquisite feeling and most faultless judgments in the
management alike of the tracery and decorations. I have given, in Plate
X., an exquisite example of it, from a panel decoration of the
buttresses of the north door of Rouen; and in order that the reader may
understand what truly fine Gothic work is, and how nobly it unites
fantasy and law, as well as for our immediate purpose, it will be well
that he should examine its sections and mouldings in detail (they are
described in the fourth Chapter, § xxvii.), and that the more carefully,
because this design belongs to a period in which the most important
change took place in the spirit of Gothic architecture, which, perhaps,
ever resulted from the natural progress of any art. That tracery marks a
pause between the laying aside of one great ruling principle, and the
taking up of another; a pause as marked, as clear, as conspicuous to the
distant view of after times, as to the distant glance of the traveller
is the culminating ridge of the mountain chain over which he has passed.
It was the great watershed of Gothic art. Before it, all had been
ascent; after it, all was decline; both, indeed, by winding paths and
varied slopes; both interrupted, like the gradual rise and fall of the
passes of the Alps, by great mountain outliers, isolated or branching
from the central chain, and by retrograde or parallel directions of the
valleys of access. But the track of the human mind is traceable up to
that glorious ridge, in a continuous line, and thence downwards. Like a
silver zone--

  "Flung about carelessly, it shines afar,
  Catching the eye in many a broken link,
  In many a turn and traverse, as it glides.
  And oft above, and oft below, appears--
  *  *  *  * to him who journeys up
  As though it were another."

And at that point, and that instant, reaching the place that was nearest
heaven, the builders looked back, for the last time, to the way by which
they had come, and the scenes through which their early course had
passed. They turned away from them and their morning light, and
descended towards a new horizon, for a time in the warmth of western
sun, but plunging with every forward step into more cold and melancholy
shade.

XXIII. The change of which I speak, is inexpressible in few words, but
one more important, more radically influential, could not be. It was the
substitution of the _line_ for the _mass_, as the element of decoration.

We have seen the mode in which the openings or penetration of the window
expanded, until what were, at first, awkward forms of intermediate
stone, became delicate lines of tracery: and I have been careful in
pointing out the peculiar attention bestowed on the proportion and
decoration of the mouldings of the window at Rouen, in Plate X., as
compared with earlier mouldings, because that beauty and care are
singularly significant. They mark that the traceries had _caught the
eye_ of the architect. Up to that time, up to the very last instant in
which the reduction and thinning of the intervening stone was
consummated, his eye had been on the openings only, on the stars of
light. He did not care about the stone, a rude border of moulding was
all he needed, it was the penetrating shape which he was watching. But
when that shape had received its last possible expansion, and when the
stone-work became an arrangement of graceful and parallel lines, that
arrangement, like some form in a picture, unseen and accidentally
developed, struck suddenly, inevitably, on the sight. It had literally
not been seen before. It flashed out in an instant as an independent
form. It became a feature of the work. The architect took it under his
care, thought over it, and distributed its members as we see.

Now, the great pause was at the moment when the space and the dividing
stone-work were both equally considered. It did not last fifty years.
The forms of the tracery were seized with a childish delight in the
novel source of beauty; and the intervening space was cast aside, as an
element of decoration, for ever. I have confined myself, in following
this change, to the window, as the feature in which it is clearest. But
the transition is the same in every member of architecture; and its
importance can hardly be understood, unless we take the pains to trace
it in the universality, of which illustrations, irrelevant to our
present purpose, will be found in the third Chapter. I pursue here the
question of truth, relating to the treatment of the mouldings.

XXIV. The reader will observe that, up to the last expansion of the
penetrations, the stone-work was necessarily considered, as it actually
is, _stiff_, and unyielding. It was so, also, during the pause of which
I have spoken, when the forms of the tracery were still severe and pure;
delicate indeed, but perfectly firm.

At the close of the period of pause, the first sign of serious change
was like a low breeze, passing through the emaciated tracery, and making
it tremble. It began to undulate like the threads of a cobweb lifted by
the wind. It lost its essence as a structure of stone. Reduced to the
slenderness of threads, it began to be considered as possessing also
their flexibility. The architect was pleased with this his new fancy,
and set himself to carry it out; and in a little time, the bars of
tracery were caused to appear to the eye as if they had been woven
together like a net. This was a change which sacrificed a great
principle of truth; it sacrificed the expression of the qualities of the
material; and, however delightful its results in their first
developments, it was ultimately ruinous.

For, observe the difference between the supposition of ductility, and
that of elastic structure noticed above in the resemblance to tree form.
That resemblance was not sought, but necessary; it resulted from the
natural conditions of strength in the pier or trunk, and slenderness in
the ribs or branches, while many of the other suggested conditions of
resemblance were perfectly true. A tree branch, though in a certain
sense flexible, is not ductile; it is as firm in its own form as the rib
of stone; both of them will yield up to certain limits, both of them
breaking when those limits are exceeded; while the tree trunk will bend
no more than the stone pillar. But when the tracery is assumed to be as
yielding as a silken cord; when the whole fragility, elasticity, and
weight of the material are to the eye, if not in terms, denied; when all
the art of the architect is applied to disprove the first conditions of
his working, and the first attributes of his materials; _this_ is a
deliberate treachery, only redeemed from the charge of direct falsehood
by the visibility of the stone surface, and degrading all the traceries
it affects exactly in the degree of its presence.

XXV. But the declining and morbid taste of the later architects, was not
satisfied with thus much deception. They were delighted with the subtle
charm they had created, and thought only of increasing its power. The
next step was to consider and represent the tracery, as not only
ductile, but penetrable; and when two mouldings met each other, to
manage their intersection, so that one should appear to pass through the
other, retaining its independence; or when two ran parallel to each
other, to represent the one as partly contained within the other, and
partly apparent above it. This form of falsity was that which crushed
the art. The flexible traceries were often beautiful, though they were
ignoble; but the penetrated traceries, rendered, as they finally were,
merely the means of exhibiting the dexterity of the stone-cutter,
annihilated both the beauty and dignity of the Gothic types. A system so
momentous in its consequences deserves some detailed examination.

XXVI. In the drawing of the shafts of the door at Lisieux, under the
spandril, in Plate VII., the reader will see the mode of managing the
intersection of similar mouldings, which was universal in the great
periods. They melted into each other, and became one at the point of
crossing, or of contact; and even the suggestion of so sharp
intersection as this of Lisieux is usually avoided (this design being,
of course, only a pointed form of the earlier Norman arcade, in which
the arches are interlaced, and lie each over the preceding, and under
the following, one, as in Anselm's tower at Canterbury), since, in the
plurality of designs, when mouldings meet each other, they coincide
through some considerable portion of their curves, meeting by contact,
rather than by intersection; and at the point of coincidence the section
of each separate moulding becomes common to the two thus melted into
each other. Thus, in the junction of the circles of the window of the
Palazzo Foscari, Plate VIII., given accurately in fig. 8, Plate IV., the
section across the line _s_, is exactly the same as that across any
break of the separated moulding above, as [=s]. It sometimes, however,
happens, that two different mouldings meet each other. This was seldom
permitted in the great periods, and, when it took place, was most
awkwardly managed. Fig. 1, Plate IV. gives the junction of the mouldings
of the gable and vertical, in the window of the _spire_ of Salisbury.
That of the gable is composed of a single, and that of the vertical of a
double cavetto, decorated with ball-flowers; and the larger single
moulding swallows up one of the double ones, and pushes forward among
the smaller balls with the most blundering and clumsy simplicity. In
comparing the sections it is to be observed that, in the upper one, the
line _a b_ represents an actual vertical in the plane of the window;
while, in the lower one, the line _c d_ represents the horizontal, in
the plane of the window, indicated by the perspective line _d e_.

XXVII. The very awkwardness with which such occurrences of difficulty
are met by the earlier builder, marks his dislike of the system, and
unwillingness to attract the eye to such arrangements. There is another
very clumsy one, in the junction of the upper and sub-arches of the
triforium of Salisbury; but it is kept in the shade, and all the
prominent junctions are of mouldings like each other, and managed with
perfect simplicity. But so soon as the attention of the builders became,
as we have just seen, fixed upon the lines of mouldings instead of the
enclosed spaces, those lines began to preserve an independent existence
wherever they met; and different mouldings were studiously associated,
in order to obtain variety of intersectional line. We must, however, do
the late builders the justice to note that, in one case, the habit grew
out of a feeling of proportion, more refined than that of earlier
workmen. It shows itself first in the bases of divided pillars, or arch
mouldings, whose smaller shafts had originally bases formed by the
continued base of the central, or other larger, columns with which they
were grouped; but it being felt, when the eye of the architect became
fastidious, that the dimension of moulding which was right for the base
of a large shaft, was wrong for that of a small one, each shaft had an
independent base; at first, those of the smaller died simply down on
that of the larger; but when the vertical sections of both became
complicated, the bases of the smaller shafts were considered to exist
within those of the larger, and the places of their emergence, on this
supposition, were calculated with the utmost nicety, and cut with
singular precision; so that an elaborate late base of a divided column,
as, for instance, of those in the nave of Abbeville, looks exactly as if
its smaller shafts had all been finished to the ground first, each with
its complete and intricate base, and then the comprehending base of the
central pier had been moulded over them in clay, leaving their points
and angles sticking out here and there, like the edges of sharp crystals
out of a nodule of earth. The exhibition of technical dexterity in work
of this kind is often marvellous, the strangest possible shapes of
sections being calculated to a hair's-breadth, and the occurrence of the
under and emergent forms being rendered, even in places where they are
so slight that they can hardly be detected but by the touch. It is
impossible to render a very elaborate example of this kind intelligible,
without some fifty measured sections; but fig. 6, Plate IV. is a very
interesting and simple one, from the west gate of Rouen. It is part of
the base of one of the narrow piers between its principal niches. The
square column _k_, having a base with the profile _p r_, is supposed to
contain within itself another similar one, set diagonally, and lifted so
far above the inclosing one, as that the recessed part of its profile
[=p] r shall fall behind the projecting part of the outer one. The angle
of its upper portion exactly meets the plane of the side of the upper
inclosing shaft 4, and would, therefore, not be seen, unless two
vertical cuts were made to exhibit it, which form two dark lines the
whole way up the shaft. Two small pilasters are run, like fastening
stitches, through the junction on the front of the shafts. The sections
[=k] [=n] taken respectively at the levels _k_, _n_, will explain the
hypothetical construction of the whole. Fig. 7 is a base, or joint
rather (for passages of this form occur again and again, on the shafts
of flamboyant work), of one of the smallest piers of the pedestals which
support the lost statues of the porch; its section below would be the
same as [=n], and its construction, after what has been said of the
other base, will be at once perceived.

  INTERSECTIONAL MOULDINGS.]

XXVIII. There was, however, in this kind of involution, much to be
admired as well as reprehended, the proportions of quantities were
always as beautiful as they were intricate; and, though the lines of
intersection were harsh, they were exquisitely opposed to the
flower-work of the interposing mouldings. But the fancy did not stop
here; it rose from the bases into the arches; and there, not finding
room enough for its exhibition, it withdrew the capitals from the heads
even of cylindrical shafts, (we cannot but admire, while we regret, the
boldness of the men who could defy the authority and custom of all the
nations of the earth for a space of some three thousand years,) in order
that the arch mouldings might appear to emerge from the pillar, as at
its base they had been lost in it, and not to terminate on the abacus of
the capital; then they ran the mouldings across and through each other,
at the point of the arch; and finally, not finding their natural
directions enough to furnish as many occasions of intersection as they
wished, bent them hither and thither, and cut off their ends short, when
they had passed the point of intersection. Fig. 2, Plate IV. is part of
a flying buttress from the apse of St. Gervais at Falaise, in which the
moulding whose section is rudely given above at [=f], (taken vertically
through the point _f_,) is carried thrice through itself, in the
cross-bar and two arches; and the flat fillet is cut off sharp at the
end of the cross-bar, for the mere pleasure of the truncation. Fig. 3
is half of the head of a door in the Stadthaus of Sursee, in which the
shaded part of the section of the joint _g g_, is that of the
arch-moulding, which is three times reduplicated, and six times
intersected by itself, the ends being cut off when they become
unmanageable. This style is, indeed, earlier exaggerated in Switzerland
and Germany, owing to the imitation in stone of the dovetailing of wood,
particularly of the intersecting of beams at the angles of châlets; but
it only furnishes the more plain instance of the danger of the
fallacious system which, from the beginning, repressed the German, and,
in the end, ruined the French Gothic. It would be too painful a task to
follow further the caricatures of form, and eccentricities of treatment,
which grow out of this singular abuse--the flattened arch, the shrunken
pillar, the lifeless ornament, the liny moulding, the distorted and
extravagant foliation, until the time came when, over these wrecks and
remnants, deprived of all unity and principle, rose the foul torrent of
the renaissance, and swept them all away. So fell the great dynasty of
mediæval architecture. It was because it had lost its own strength, and
disobeyed its own laws--because its order, and consistency, and
organization, had been broken through--that it could oppose no
resistance to the rush of overwhelming innovation. And this, observe,
all because it had sacrificed a single truth. From that one surrender of
its integrity, from that one endeavor to assume the semblance of what it
was not, arose the multitudinous forms of disease and decrepitude, which
rotted away the pillars of its supremacy. It was not because its time
was come; it was not because it was scorned by the classical Romanist,
or dreaded by the faithful Protestant. That scorn and that fear it might
have survived, and lived; it would have stood forth in stern comparison
with the enervated sensuality of the renaissance; it would have risen in
renewed and purified honor, and with a new soul, from the ashes into
which it sank, giving up its glory, as it had received it, for the honor
of God--but its own truth was gone, and it sank forever. There was no
wisdom nor strength left in it, to raise it from the dust; and the error
of zeal, and the softness of luxury smote it down and dissolved it
away. It is good for us to remember this, as we tread upon the bare
ground of its foundations, and stumble over its scattered stones. Those
rent skeletons of pierced wall, through which our sea-winds moan and
murmur, strewing them joint by joint, and bone by bone, along the bleak
promontories on which the Pharos lights came once from houses of
prayer--those grey arches and quiet isles under which the sheep of our
valleys feed and rest on the turf that has buried their altars--those
shapeless heaps, that are not of the Earth, which lift our fields into
strange and sudden banks of flowers, and stay our mountain streams with
stones that are not their own, have other thoughts to ask from us than
those of mourning for the rage that despoiled, or the fear that forsook
them. It was not the robber, not the fanatic, not the blasphemer, who
sealed the destruction that they had wrought; the war, the wrath, the
terror, might have worked their worst, and the strong walls would have
risen, and the slight pillars would have started again, from under the
hand of the destroyer. But they could not rise out of the ruins of their
own violated truth.




CHAPTER III.

THE LAMP OF POWER.


I. In recalling the impressions we have received from the works of man,
after a lapse of time long enough to involve in obscurity all but the
most vivid, it often happens that we find a strange pre-eminence and
durability in many upon whose strength we had little calculated, and
that points of character which had escaped the detection of the
judgment, become developed under the waste of memory; as veins of harder
rock, whose places could not at first have been discovered by the eye,
are left salient under the action of frosts and streams. The traveller
who desires to correct the errors of his judgment, necessitated by
inequalities of temper, infelicities of circumstance, and accidents of
association, has no other resource than to wait for the calm verdict of
interposing years; and to watch for the new arrangements of eminence and
shape in the images which remain latest in his memory; as in the ebbing
of a mountain lake, he would watch the varying outlines of its
successive shore, and trace, in the form of its departing waters, the
true direction of the forces which had cleft, or the currents which had
excavated, the deepest recesses of its primal bed.

In thus reverting to the memories of those works of architecture by
which we have been most pleasurably impressed, it will generally happen
that they fall into two broad classes: the one characterized by an
exceeding preciousness and delicacy, to which we recur with a sense of
affectionate admiration; and the other by a severe, and, in many cases,
mysterious, majesty, which we remember with an undiminished awe, like
that felt at the presence and operation of some great Spiritual Power.
From about these two groups, more or less harmonised by intermediate
examples, but always distinctively marked by features of beauty or of
power, there will be swept away, in multitudes, the memories of
buildings, perhaps, in their first address to our minds, of no inferior
pretension, but owing their impressiveness to characters of less
enduring nobility--to value of material, accumulation of ornament, or
ingenuity of mechanical construction. Especial interest may, indeed,
have been awakened by such circumstances, and the memory may have been,
consequently, rendered tenacious of particular parts or effects of the
structure; but it will recall even these only by an active effort, and
then without emotion; while in passive moments, and with thrilling
influence, the image of purer beauty, and of more spiritual power, will
return in a fair and solemn company; and while the pride of many a
stately palace, and the wealth of many a jewelled shrine, perish from
our thoughts in a dust of gold, there will rise, through their dimness,
the white image of some secluded marble chapel, by river or forest side,
with the fretted flower-work shrinking under its arches, as if under
vaults of late-fallen snow; or the vast weariness of some shadowy wall
whose separate stones are like mountain foundations, and yet numberless.

II. Now, the difference between these two orders of build-ing is not
merely that which there is in nature between things beautiful and
sublime. It is, also, the difference between what is derivative and
original in man's work; for whatever is in architecture fair or
beautiful, is imitated from natural forms; and what is not so derived,
but depends for its dignity upon arrangement and government received
from human mind, becomes the expression of the power of that mind, and
receives a sublimity high in proportion to the power expressed. All
building, therefore, shows man either as gathering or governing: and the
secrets of his success are his knowing what to gather, and how to rule.
These are the two great intellectual Lamps of Architecture; the one
consisting in a just and humble veneration for the works of God upon the
earth, and the other in an understanding of the dominion over those
works which has been vested in man.

III. Besides this expression of living authority and power, there is,
however, a sympathy in the forms of noble building, with what is most
sublime in natural things; and it is the governing Power directed by
this sympathy, whose operation I shall at present endeavor to trace,
abandoning all inquiry into the more abstract fields of invention: for
this latter faculty, and the questions of proportion and arrangement
connected with its discussion, can only be rightly examined in a general
view of all arts; but its sympathy, in architecture, with the vast
controlling powers of Nature herself, is special, and may shortly be
considered; and that with the more advantage, that it has, of late, been
little felt or regarded by architects. I have seen, in recent efforts,
much contest between two schools, one affecting originality, and the
other legality--many attempts at beauty of design--many ingenious
adaptations of construction; but I have never seen any aim at the
expression of abstract power; never any appearance of a consciousness
that, in this primal art of man, there is room for the marking of his
relations with the mightiest, as well as the fairest, works of God; and
that those works themselves have been permitted, by their Master and
his, to receive an added glory from their association with earnest
efforts of human thought. In the edifices of Man there should be found
reverent worship and following, not only of the spirit which rounds the
pillars of the forest, and arches the vault of the avenue--which gives
veining to the leaf, and polish to the shell, and grace to every pulse
that agitates animal organization,--but of that also which reproves the
pillars of the earth, and builds up her barren precipices into the
coldness of the clouds, and lifts her shadowy cones of mountain purple
into the pale arch of the sky; for these, and other glories more than
these, refuse not to connect themselves, in his thoughts, with the work
of his own hand; the grey cliff loses not its nobleness when it reminds
us of some Cyclopean waste of mural stone; the pinnacles of the rocky
promontory arrange themselves, undegraded, into fantastic semblances of
fortress towers; and even the awful cone of the far-off mountain has a
melancholy mixed with that of its own solitude, which is cast from the
images of nameless tumuli on white sea-shores, and of the heaps of reedy
clay, into which chambered cities melt in their mortality.

IV. Let us, then, see what is this power and majesty, which Nature
herself does not disdain to accept from the works of man; and what that
sublimity in the masses built up by his coralline-like energy, which is
honorable, even when transferred by association to the dateless hills,
which it needed earthquakes to lift, and deluges to mould.

And, first of mere size: It might not be thought possible to emulate the
sublimity of natural objects in this respect; nor would it be, if the
architect contended with them in pitched battle. It would not be well to
build pyramids in the valley of Chamouni; and St. Peter's, among its
many other errors, counts for not the least injurious its position on
the slope of an inconsiderable hill. But imagine it placed on the plain
of Marengo, or, like the Superga of Turin, or like La Salute at Venice!
The fact is, that the apprehension of the size of natural objects, as
well as of architecture, depends more on fortunate excitement of the
imagination than on measurements by the eye; and the architect has a
peculiar advantage in being able to press close upon the sight, such
magnitude as he can command. There are few rocks, even among the Alps,
that have a clear vertical fall as high as the choir of Beauvais; and
if we secure a good precipice of wall, or a sheer and unbroken flank of
tower, and place them where there are no enormous natural features to
oppose them, we shall feel in them no want of sublimity of size. And it
may be matter of encouragement in this respect, though one also of
regret, to observe how much oftener man destroys natural sublimity, than
nature crushes human power. It does not need much to humiliate a
mountain. A hut will sometimes do it; I never look up to the Col de
Balme from Chamouni, without a violent feeling of provocation against
its hospitable little cabin, whose bright white walls form a visibly
four-square spot on the green ridge, and entirely destroy all idea of
its elevation. A single villa will often mar a whole landscape, and
dethrone a dynasty of hills, and the Acropolis of Athens, Parthenon and
all, has, I believe, been dwarfed into a model by the palace lately
built beneath it. The fact is, that hills are not so high as we fancy
them, and, when to the actual impression of no mean comparative size, is
added the sense of the toil of manly hand and thought, a sublimity is
reached, which nothing but gross error in arrangement of its parts can
destroy.

V. While, therefore, it is not to be supposed that mere size will
ennoble a mean design, yet every increase of magnitude will bestow upon
it a certain degree of nobleness: so that it is well to determine at
first, whether the building is to be markedly beautiful or markedly
sublime; and if the latter, not to be withheld by respect to smaller
parts from reaching largeness of scale; provided only, that it be
evidently in the architect's power to reach at least that degree of
magnitude which is the lowest at which sublimity begins, rudely
definable as that which will make a living figure look less than life
beside it. It is the misfortune of most of our modern buildings that we
would fain have an universal excellence in them; and so part of the
funds must go in painting, part in gilding, part in fitting up, part in
painted windows, part in small steeples, part in ornaments here and
there; and neither the windows, nor the steeple, nor the ornaments, are
worth their materials. For there is a crust about the impressible part
of men's minds, which must be pierced through before they can be
touched to the quick; and though we may prick at it and scratch it in a
thousand separate places, we might as well have let it alone if we do
not come through somewhere with a deep thrust: and if we can give such a
thrust anywhere, there is no need of another; it need not be even so
"wide as a church door," so that it be _enough_. And mere weight will do
this; it is a clumsy way of doing it, but an effectual one, too; and the
apathy which cannot be pierced through by a small steeple, nor shone
through by a small window, can be broken through in a moment by the mere
weight of a great wall. Let, therefore, the architect who has not large
resources, choose his point of attack first, and, if he choose size, let
him abandon decoration; for, unless they are concentrated, and numerous
enough to make their concentration conspicuous, all his ornaments
together would not be worth one huge stone. And the choice must be a
decided one, without compromise. It must be no question whether his
capitals would not look better with a little carving--let him leave them
huge as blocks; or whether his arches should not have richer
architraves--let him throw them a foot higher, if he can; a yard more
across the nave will be worth more to him than a tesselated pavement;
and another fathom of outer wall, than an army of pinnacles. The
limitation of size must be only in the uses of the building, or in the
ground at his disposal.

VI. That limitation, however, being by such circumstances determined, by
what means, it is to be next asked, may the actual magnitude be best
displayed; since it is seldom, perhaps never, that a building of any
pretension to size looks so large as it is. The appearance of a figure
in any distant, more especially in any upper, parts of it will almost
always prove that we have under-estimated the magnitude of those parts.

It has often been observed that a building, in order to show its
magnitude, must be seen all at once. It would, perhaps, be better to
say, must be bounded as much as possible by continuous lines, and that
its extreme points should be seen all at once; or we may state, in
simpler terms still, that it must have one visible bounding line from
top to bottom, and from end to end. This bounding line from top to
bottom may either be inclined inwards, and the mass, therefore,
pyramidical; or vertical, and the mass form one grand cliff; or inclined
outwards, as in the advancing fronts of old houses, and, in a sort, in
the Greek temple, and in all buildings with heavy cornices or heads.
Now, in all these cases, if the bounding line be violently broken; if
the cornice project, or the upper portion of the pyramid recede, too
violently, majesty will be lost; not because the building cannot be seen
all at once,--for in the case of a heavy cornice no part of it is
necessarily concealed--but because the continuity of its terminal line
is broken, and the _length of that line_, therefore, cannot be
estimated. But the error is, of course, more fatal when much of the
building is also concealed; as in the well-known case of the recession
of the dome of St. Peter's, and, from the greater number of points of
view, in churches whose highest portions, whether dome or tower, are
over their cross. Thus there is only one point from which the size of
the Cathedral of Florence is felt; and that is from the corner of the
Via de' Balestrieri, opposite the south-east angle, where it happens
that the dome is seen rising instantly above the apse and transepts. In
all cases in which the tower is over the cross, the grandeur and height
of the tower itself are lost, because there is but one line down which
the eye can trace the whole height, and that is in the inner angle of
the cross, not easily discerned. Hence, while, in symmetry and feeling,
such designs may often have pre-eminence, yet, where the height of the
tower itself is to be made apparent, it must be at the west end, or
better still, detached as a campanile. Imagine the loss to the Lombard
churches if their campaniles were carried only to their present height
over their crosses; or to the Cathedral of Rouen, if the Tour de Beurre
were made central, in the place of its present debased spire!

VII. Whether, therefore, we have to do with tower or wall, there must be
one bounding line from base to coping; and I am much inclined, myself,
to love the true vertical, or the vertical, with a solemn frown of
projection (not a scowl), as in the Palazzo Vecchio of Florence. This
character is always given to rocks by the poets; with slight foundation
indeed real rocks being little given to overhanging--but with excellent
judgment; for the sense of threatening conveyed by this form is a nobler
character than that of mere size. And, in buildings, this threatening
should be somewhat carried down into their mass. A mere projecting shelf
is not enough, the whole wall must, Jupiter like, nod as well as frown.
Hence, I think the propped machicolations of the Palazzo Vecchio and
Duomo of Florence far grander headings than any form of Greek cornice.
Sometimes the projection may be thrown lower, as in the Doge's palace of
Venice, where the chief appearance of it is above the second arcade; or
it may become a grand swell from the ground, as the head of a ship of
the line rises from the sea. This is very nobly attained by the
projection of the niches in the third story of the Tour de Beurre at
Rouen.

VIII. What is needful in the setting forth of magnitude in height, is
right also in the marking it in area--let it be gathered well together.
It is especially to be noted with respect to the Palazzo Vecchio and
other mighty buildings of its order, how mistakenly it has been stated
that dimension, in order to become impressive, should be expanded either
in height or length, but not equally: whereas, rather it will be found
that those buildings seem on the whole the vastest which have been
gathered up into a mighty square, and which look as if they had been
measured by the angel's rod, "the length, and the breadth, and the
height of it are equal," and herein something is to be taken notice of,
which I believe not to be sufficiently, if at all, considered among our
architects.

Of the many broad divisions under which architecture may be considered,
none appear to me more significant than that into buildings whose
interest is in their walls, and those whose interest is in the lines
dividing their walls. In the Greek temple the wall is as nothing; the
entire interest is in the detached columns and the frieze they bear; in
French Flamboyant, and in our detestable Perpendicular, the object is to
get rid of the wall surface, and keep the eye altogether on tracery of
line; in Romanesque work and Egyptian, the wall is a confessed and
honored member, and the light is often allowed to fall on large areas of
it, variously decorated. Now, both these principles are admitted by
Nature, the one in her woods and thickets, the other in her plains, and
cliffs, and waters; but the latter is pre-eminently the principle of
power, and, in some sense, of beauty also. For, whatever infinity of
fair form there may be in the maze of the forest, there is a fairer, as
I think, in the surface of the quiet lake; and I hardly know that
association of shaft or tracery, for which I would exchange the warm
sleep of sunshine on some smooth, broad, human-like front of marble.
Nevertheless, if breadth is to be beautiful, its substance must in some
sort be beautiful; and we must not hastily condemn the exclusive resting
of the northern architects in divided lines, until at least we have
remembered the difference between a blank surface of Caen stone, and one
mixed from Genoa and Carrara, of serpentine with snow: but as regards
abstract power and awfulness, there is no question; without breadth of
surface it is in vain to seek them, and it matters little, so that the
surface be wide, bold and unbroken, whether it be of brick or of jasper;
the light of heaven upon it, and the weight of earth in it, are all we
need: for it is singular how forgetful the mind may become both of
material and workmanship, if only it have space enough over which to
range, and to remind it, however feebly, of the joy that it has in
contemplating the flatness and sweep of great plains and broad seas. And
it is a noble thing for men to do this with their cut stone or moulded
clay, and to make the face of a wall look infinite, and its edge against
the sky like an horizon: or even if less than this be reached, it is
still delightful to mark the play of passing light on its broad surface,
and to see by how many artifices and gradations of tinting and shadow,
time and storm will set their wild signatures upon it; and how in the
rising or declining of the day the unbroken twilight rests long and
luridly on its high lineless forehead, and fades away untraceably down
its tiers of confused and countless stone.

IX. This, then, being, as I think, one of the peculiar elements of
sublime architecture, it may be easily seen how necessarily consequent
upon the love of it will be the choice of a form approaching to the
square for the main outline.

For, in whatever direction the building is contracted, in that direction
the eye will be drawn to its terminal lines; and the sense of surface
will only be at its fullest when those lines are removed, in every
direction, as far as possible. Thus the square and circle are
pre-eminently the areas of power among those bounded by purely straight
or curved lines; and these, with their relative solids, the cube and
sphere, and relative solids of progression (as in the investigation of
the laws of proportion I shall call those masses which are generated by
the progression of an area of given form along a line in a given
direction), the square and cylindrical column, are the elements of
utmost power in all architectural arrangements. On the other hand, grace
and perfect proportion require an elongation in some one direction: and
a sense of power may be communicated to this form of magnitude by a
continuous series of any marked features, such as the eye may be unable
to number; while yet we feel, from their boldness, decision, and
simplicity, that it is indeed their multitude which has embarrassed us,
not any confusion or indistinctness of form. This expedient of continued
series forms the sublimity of arcades and aisles, of all ranges of
columns, and, on a smaller scale, of those Greek mouldings, of which,
repeated as they now are in all the meanest and most familiar forms of
our furniture, it is impossible altogether to weary. Now, it is evident
that the architect has choice of two types of form, each properly
associated with its own kind of interest or decoration: the square, or
greatest area, to be chosen especially when the _surface_ is to be the
subject of thought; and the elongated area, when the _divisions_ of the
surface are to be the subjects of thought. Both these orders of form, as
I think nearly every other source of power and beauty, are marvellously
united in that building which I fear to weary the reader by bringing
forward too frequently, as a model of all perfection--the Doge's palace
at Venice: its general arrangement, a hollow square; its principal
façade, an oblong, elongated to the eye by a range of thirty-four small
arches, and thirty-five columns, while it is separated by a
richly-canopied window in the centre, into two massive divisions, whose
height and length are nearly as four to five; the arcades which give it
length being confined to the lower stories, and the upper, between its
broad windows, left a mighty surface of smooth marble, chequered with
blocks of alternate rose-color and white. It would be impossible, I
believe, to invent a more magnificent arrangement of all that is in
building most dignified and most fair.

X. In the Lombard Romanesque, the two principles are more fused into
each other, as most characteristically in the Cathedral of Pisa: length
of proportion, exhibited by an arcade of twenty-one arches above, and
fifteen below, at the side of the nave; bold square proportion in the
front; that front divided into arcades, placed one above the other, the
lowest with its pillars engaged, of seven arches, the four uppermost
thrown out boldly from the receding wall, and casting deep shadows; the
first, above the basement, of nineteen arches; the second of twenty-one;
the third and fourth of eight each; sixty-three arches in all; all
_circular_ headed, all with cylindrical shafts, and the lowest with
_square_ panellings, set diagonally under their semicircles, an
universal ornament in this style (Plate XII., fig. 7); the apse, a
semicircle, with a semi-dome for its roof, and three ranges of circular
arches for its exterior ornament; in the interior of the nave, a range
of circular arches below a circular-arched triforium, and a vast flat
_surface_, observe, of wall decorated with striped marble above; the
whole arrangement (not a peculiar one, but characteristic of every
church of the period; and, to my feeling, the most majestic; not perhaps
the fairest, but the mightiest type of form which the mind of man has
ever conceived) based exclusively on associations of the circle and the
square.

I am now, however, trenching upon ground which I desire to reserve for
more careful examination, in connection with other æsthetic questions:
but I believe the examples I have given will justify my vindication of
the square form from the reprobation which has been lightly thrown upon
it; nor might this be done for it only as a ruling outline, but as
occurring constantly in the best mosaics, and in a thousand forms of
minor decoration, which I cannot now examine; my chief assertion of its
majesty being always as it is an exponent of space and surface, and
therefore to be chosen, either to rule in their outlines, or to adorn by
masses of light and shade those portions of buildings in which surface
is to be rendered precious or honorable.

XI. Thus far, then, of general forms, and of the modes in which the
scale of architecture is best to be exhibited. Let us next consider the
manifestations of power which belong to its details and lesser
divisions.

The first division we have to regard, is the inevitable one of masonry.
It is true that this division may, by great art, be concealed; but I
think it unwise (as well as dishonest) to do so; for this reason, that
there is a very noble character always to be obtained by the opposition
of large stones to divided masonry, as by shafts and columns of one
piece, or massy lintels and architraves, to wall work of bricks or
smaller stones; and there is a certain organization in the management of
such parts, like that of the continuous bones of the skeleton, opposed
to the vertebræ, which it is not well to surrender. I hold, therefore,
that, for this and other reasons, the masonry of a building is to be
shown: and also that, with certain rare exceptions (as in the cases of
chapels and shrines of most finished workmanship), the smaller the
building, the more necessary it is that its masonry should be bold, and
_vice versâ_. For if a building be under the mark of average magnitude,
it is not in our power to increase its apparent size (too easily
measurable) by any proportionate diminution in the scale of its masonry.
But it may be often in our power to give it a certain nobility by
building it of massy stones, or, at all events, introducing such into
its make. Thus it is impossible that there should ever be majesty in a
cottage built of brick; but there is a marked element of sublimity in
the rude and irregular piling of the rocky walls of the mountain
cottages of Wales, Cumberland, and Scotland. Their size is not one whit
diminished, though four or five stones reach at their angles from the
ground to the eaves, or though a native rock happen to project
conveniently, and to be built into the framework of the wall. On the
other hand, after a building has once reached the mark of majestic size,
it matters, indeed, comparatively little whether its masonry be large or
small, but if it be altogether large, it will sometimes diminish the
magnitude for want of a measure; if altogether small, it will suggest
ideas of poverty in material, or deficiency in mechanical resource,
besides interfering in many cases with the lines of the design, and
delicacy of the workmanship. A very unhappy instance of such
interference exists in the façade of the church of St. Madeleine at
Paris, where the columns, being built of very small stones of nearly
equal size, with visible joints, look as if they were covered with a
close trellis. So, then, that masonry will be generally the most
magnificent which, without the use of materials systematically small or
large, accommodates itself, naturally and frankly, to the conditions and
structure of its work, and displays alike its power of dealing with the
vastest masses, and of accomplishing its purpose with the smallest,
sometimes heaping rock upon rock with Titanic commandment, and anon
binding the dusty remnants and edgy splinters into springing vaults and
swelling domes. And if the nobility of this confessed and natural
masonry were more commonly felt, we should not lose the dignity of it by
smoothing surfaces and fitting joints. The sums which we waste in
chiselling and polishing stones which would have been better left as
they came from the quarry would often raise a building a story higher.
Only in this there is to be a certain respect for material also: for if
we build in marble, or in any limestone, the known ease of the
workmanship will make its absence seem slovenly; it will be well to take
advantage of the stone's softness, and to make the design delicate and
dependent upon smoothness of chiselled surfaces: but if we build in
granite or lava, it is a folly, in most cases, to cast away the labor
necessary to smooth it; it is wiser to make the design granitic itself,
and to leave the blocks rudely squared. I do not deny a certain splendor
and sense of power in the smoothing of granite, and in the entire
subduing of its iron resistance to the human supremacy. But, in most
cases, I believe, the labor and time necessary to do this would be
better spent in another way; and that to raise a building to a height of
a hundred feet with rough blocks, is better than to raise it to seventy
with smooth ones. There is also a magnificence in the natural cleavage
of the stone to which the art must indeed be great that pretends to be
equivalent; and a stern expression of brotherhood with the mountain
heart from which it has been rent, ill-exchanged for a glistering
obedience to the rule and measure of men. His eye must be delicate
indeed, who would desire to see the Pitti palace polished.

XII. Next to those of the masonry, we have to consider the divisions of
the design itself. Those divisions are, necessarily, either into masses
of light and shade, or else by traced lines; which latter must be,
indeed, themselves produced by incisions or projections which, in some
lights, cast a certain breadth of shade, but which may, nevertheless, if
finely enough cut, be always true lines, in distant effect. I call, for
instance, such panelling as that of Henry the Seventh's chapel, pure
linear division.

Now, it does not seem to me sufficiently recollected, that a wall
surface is to an architect simply what a white canvas is to a painter,
with this only difference, that the wall has already a sublimity in its
height, substance, and other characters already considered, on which it
is more dangerous to break than to touch with shade the canvas surface.
And, for my own part, I think a smooth, broad, freshly laid surface of
gesso a fairer thing than most pictures I see painted on it; much more,
a noble surface of stone than most architectural features which it is
caused to assume. But however this may be, the canvas and wall are
supposed to be given, and it is our craft to divide them.

And the principles on which this division is to be made, are as regards
relation of quantities, the same in architecture as in painting, or
indeed, in any other art whatsoever, only the painter is by his varied
subject partly permitted, partly compelled, to dispense with the
symmetry of architectural light and shade, and to adopt arrangements
apparently free and accidental. So that in modes of grouping there is
much difference (though no opposition) between the two arts; but in
rules of quantity, both are alike, so far forth as their commands of
means are alike. For the architect, not being able to secure always the
same depth or decision of shadow, nor to add to its sadness by color
(because even when color is employed, it cannot follow the moving
shade), is compelled to make many allowances, and avail himself of many
contrivances, which the painter needs neither consider nor employ.

XIII. Of these limitations the first consequence is, that positive shade
is a more necessary and more sublime thing in an architect's hands than
in a painter's. For the latter being able to temper his light with an
under-tone throughout, and to make it delightful with sweet color, or
awful with lurid color, and to represent distance, and air, and sun, by
the depth of it, and fill its whole space with expression, can deal with
an enormous, nay, almost with an universal extent of it, and the best
painters most delight in such extent; but as light, with the architect,
is nearly always liable to become full and untempered sunshine seen upon
solid surface, his only rests, and his chief means of sublimity, are
definite shades. So that, after size and weight, the Power of
architecture may be said to depend on the quantity (whether measured in
space or intenseness) of its shadow; and it seems to me, that the
reality of its works, and the use and influence they have in the daily
life of men (as opposed to those works of art with which we have nothing
to do but in times of rest or of pleasure) require of it that it should
express a kind of human sympathy, by a measure of darkness as great as
there is in human life: and that as the great poem and great fiction
generally affect us most by the majesty of their masses of shade, and
cannot take hold upon us if they affect a continuance of lyric
sprightliness, but must be serious often, and sometimes melancholy, else
they do not express the truth of this wild world of ours; so there must
be, in this magnificently human art of architecture, some equivalent
expression for the trouble and wrath of life, for its sorrow and its
mystery: and this it can only give by depth or diffusion of gloom, by
the frown upon its front, and the shadow of its recess. So that
Rembrandtism is a noble manner in architecture, though a false one in
painting; and I do not believe that ever any building was truly great,
unless it had mighty masses, vigorous and deep, of shadow mingled with
its surface. And among the first habits that a young architect should
learn, is that of thinking in shadow, not looking at a design in its
miserable liny skeleton; but conceiving it as it will be when the dawn
lights it, and the dusk leaves it; when its stones will be hot and its
crannies cool; when the lizards will bask on the one, and the birds
build in the other. Let him design with the sense of cold and heat upon
him; let him cut out the shadows, as men dig wells in unwatered plains;
and lead along the lights, as a founder does his hot metal; let him keep
the full command of both, and see that he knows how they fall, and where
they fade. His paper lines and proportions are of no value: all that he
has to do must be done by spaces of light and darkness; and his business
is to see that the one is broad and bold enough not to be swallowed up
by twilight, and the other deep enough not to be dried like a shallow
pool by a noon-day sun.

And that this may be, the first necessity is that the quantities of
shade or light, whatever they may be, shall be thrown into masses,
either of something like equal weight, or else large masses of the one
relieved with small of the other; but masses of one or other kind there
must be. No design that is divided at all, and is not divided into
masses, can ever be of the smallest value: this great law respecting
breadth, precisely the same in architecture and painting, is so
important, that the examination of its two principal applications will
include most of the conditions of majestic design on which I would at
present insist.

XIV. Painters are in the habit of speaking loosely of masses of light
and shade, meaning thereby any large spaces of either. Nevertheless, it
is convenient sometimes to restrict the term "mass" to the portions to
which proper form belongs, and to call the field on which such forms are
traced, interval. Thus, in foliage with projecting boughs or stems, we
have masses of light, with intervals of shade; and, in light skies with
dark clouds upon them, masses of shade with intervals of light.

This distinction is, in architecture, still more necessary; for there
are two marked styles dependent upon it: one in which the forms are
drawn with light upon darkness, as in Greek sculpture and pillars; the
other in which they are drawn with darkness upon light, as in early
Gothic foliation. Now, it is not in the designer's power determinately
to vary degrees and places of darkness, but it is altogether in his
power to vary in determined directions his degrees of light. Hence, the
use of the dark mass characterises, generally, a trenchant style of
design, in which the darks and lights are both flat, and terminated by
sharp edges; while the use of the light mass is in the same way
associated with a softened and full manner of design, in which the darks
are much warmed by reflected lights, and the lights are rounded and melt
into them. The term applied by Milton to Doric bas-relief--"bossy," is,
as is generally the case with Milton's epithets, the most comprehensive
and expressive of this manner, which the English language contains;
while the term which specifically describes the chief member of early
Gothic decoration, feuille, foil or leaf, is equally significative of a
flat space of shade.

XV. We shall shortly consider the actual modes in which these two kinds
of mass have been treated. And, first, of the light, or rounded, mass.
The modes in which relief was secured for the more projecting forms of
bas-relief, by the Greeks, have been too well described by Mr.
Eastlake[I] to need recapitulation: the conclusion which forces itself
upon us from the facts he has remarked, being one on which I shall have
occasion farther to insist presently, that the Greek workman cared for
shadow only as a dark field wherefrom his light figure or design might
be intelligibly detached: his attention was concentrated on the one aim
at readableness, and clearness of accent; and all composition, all
harmony, nay, the very vitality and energy of separate groups were, when
necessary, sacrificed to plain speaking. Nor was there any predilection
for one kind of form rather than another. Bounded forms were, in the
columns and principal decorative members, adopted, not for their own
sake, but as characteristic of the things represented. They were
beautifully rounded, because the Greek habitually did well what he had
to do, not because he loved roundness more than squareness; severely
rectilinear forms were associated with the curved ones in the cornice
and triglyph, and the mass of the pillar was divided by a fluting,
which, in distant effect, destroyed much of its breadth. What power of
light these primal arrangements left, was diminished in successive
refinements and additions of ornament; and continued to diminish through
Roman work, until the confirmation of the circular arch as a decorative
feature. Its lovely and simple line taught the eye to ask for a similar
boundary of solid form; the dome followed, and necessarily the
decorative masses were thenceforward managed with reference to, and in
sympathy with, the chief feature of the building. Hence arose, among the
Byzantine architects, a system of ornament, entirely restrained within
the superfices of curvilinear masses, on which the light fell with as
unbroken gradation as on a dome or column, while the illumined surface
was nevertheless cut into details of singular and most ingenious
intricacy. Something is, of course, to be allowed for the less dexterity
of the workmen; it being easier to cut down into a solid block, than to
arrange the projecting portions of leaf on the Greek capital: such leafy
capitals are nevertheless executed by the Byzantines with skill enough
to show that their preference of the massive form was by no means
compulsory, nor can I think it unwise. On the contrary, while the
arrangements of _line_ are far more artful in the Greek capital, the
Byzantine light and shade are as incontestably more grand and masculine,
based on that quality of pure gradation, which nearly all natural
objects possess, and the attainment of which is, in fact, the first and
most palpable purpose in natural arrangements of grand form. The rolling
heap of the thunder-cloud, divided by rents, and multiplied by wreaths,
yet gathering them all into its broad, torrid, and towering zone, and
its midnight darkness opposite; the scarcely less majestic heave of the
mountain side, all torn and traversed by depth of defile and ridge of
rock, yet never losing the unity of its illumined swell and shadowy
decline; and the head of every mighty tree, rich with tracery of leaf
and bough, yet terminated against the sky by a true line, and rounded by
a green horizon, which, multiplied in the distant forest, makes it look
bossy from above; all these mark, for a great and honored law, that
diffusion of light for which the Byzantine ornaments were designed; and
show us that those builders had truer sympathy with what God made
majestic, than the self-contemplating and self-contented Greek. I know
that they are barbaric in comparison; but there is a power in their
barbarism of sterner tone, a power not sophistic nor penetrative, but
embracing and mysterious; a power faithful more than thoughtful, which
conceived and felt more than it created; a power that neither
comprehended nor ruled itself, but worked and wandered as it listed,
like mountain streams and winds; and which could not rest in the
expression or seizure of finite form. It could not bury itself in
acanthus leaves. Its imagery was taken from the shadows of the storms
and hills, and had fellowship with the night and day of the earth
itself.

    [I] Literature of the Fine Arts.--Essay on Bas-relief.

XVI. I have endeavored to give some idea of one of the hollow balls of
stone which, surrounded by flowing leafage, occur in varied succession
on the architrave of the central gate of St. Mark's at Venice, in Plate
I. fig. 2. It seems to me singularly beautiful in its unity of
lightness, and delicacy of detail, with breadth of light. It looks as if
its leaves had been sensitive, and had risen and shut themselves into a
bud at some sudden touch, and would presently fall back again into their
wild flow. The cornices of San Michele of Lucca, seen above and below
the arch, in Plate VI., show the effect of heavy leafage and thick stems
arranged on a surface whose curve is a simple quadrant, the light dying
from off them as it turns. It would be difficult, as I think, to invent
anything more noble; and I insist on the broad character of their
arrangement the more earnestly, because, afterwards modified by greater
skill in its management, it became characteristic of the richest pieces
of Gothic design. The capital, given in Plate V., is of the noblest
period of the Venetian Gothic; and it is interesting to see the play of
leafage so luxuriant, absolutely subordinated to the breadth of two
masses of light and shade. What is done by the Venetian architect, with
a power as irresistible as that of the waves of his surrounding sea, is
done by the masters of the Cis-Alpine Gothic, more timidly, and with a
manner somewhat cramped and cold, but not less expressing their assent
to the same great law. The ice spiculæ of the North, and its broken
sunshine, seem to have image in, and influence on the work; and the
leaves which, under the Italian's hand, roll, and flow, and bow down
over their black shadows, as in the weariness of noon-day heat, are, in
the North, crisped and frost-bitten, wrinkled on the edges, and
sparkling as if with dew. But the rounding of the ruling form is not
less sought and felt. In the lower part of Plate I. is the finial of the
pediment given in Plate II., from the cathedral of St. Lo. It is exactly
similar in feeling to the Byzantine capital, being rounded under the
abacus by four branches of thistle leaves, whose stems, springing from
the angles, bend outwards and fall back to the head, throwing their
jaggy spines down upon the full light, forming two sharp quatre-foils. I
could not get near enough to this finial to see with what degree of
delicacy the spines were cut; but I have sketched a natural group of
thistle-leaves beside it, that the reader may compare the types, and see
with what mastery they are subjected to the broad form of the whole. The
small capital from Coutances, Plate XIII. fig. 4, which is of earlier
date, is of simpler elements, and exhibits the principle still more
clearly; but the St. Lo finial is only one of a thousand instances which
might be gathered even from the fully developed flamboyant, the feeling
of breadth being retained in minor ornaments long after it had been lost
in the main design, and sometimes capriciously renewing itself
throughout, as in the cylindrical niches and pedestals which enrich the
porches of Caudebec and Rouen. Fig. 1, Plate I. is the simplest of those
of Rouen; in the more elaborate there are four projecting sides, divided
by buttresses into eight rounded compartments of tracery; even the whole
bulk of the outer pier is treated with the same feeling; and though
composed partly of concave recesses, partly of square shafts, partly of
statues and tabernacle work, arranges itself as a whole into one richly
rounded tower.

XVII. I cannot here enter into the curious questions connected with the
management of larger curved surfaces; into the causes of the difference
in proportion necessary to be observed between round and square towers;
nor into the reasons why a column or ball may be richly ornamented,
while surface decorations would be inexpedient on masses like the Castle
of St. Angelo, the tomb of Cecilia Metella, or the dome of St. Peter's.
But what has been above said of the desireableness of serenity in plane
surfaces, applies still more forcibly to those which are curved; and it
is to be remembered that we are, at present, considering how this
serenity and power may be carried into minor divisions, not how the
ornamental character of the lower form may, upon occasion, be permitted
to fret the calmness of the higher. Nor, though the instances we have
examined are of globular or cylindrical masses chiefly, is it to be
thought that breadth can only be secured by such alone: many of the
noblest forms are of subdued curvature, sometimes hardly visible; but
curvature of some degree there must be, in order to secure any measure
of grandeur in a small mass of light. One of the most marked
distinctions between one artist and another, in the point of skill, will
be found in their relative delicacy of perception of rounded surface;
the full power of expressing the perspective, foreshortening and various
undulation of such surface is, perhaps, the last and most difficult
attainment of the hand and eye. For instance: there is, perhaps, no tree
which has baffled the landscape painter more than the common black
spruce fir. It is rare that we see any representation of it other than
caricature. It is conceived as if it grew in one plane, or as a section
of a tree, with a set of boughs symmetrically dependent on opposite
sides. It is thought formal, unmanageable, and ugly. It would be so, if
it grew as it is drawn. But the power of the tree is not in that
chandelier-like section. It is in the dark, flat, solid tables of
leafage, which it holds out on its strong arms, curved slightly over
them like shields, and spreading towards the extremity like a hand. It
is vain to endeavor to paint the sharp, grassy, intricate leafage, until
this ruling form has been secured; and in the boughs that approach the
spectator, the foreshortening of it is like that of a wide hill
country, ridge just rising over ridge in successive distances; and the
finger-like extremities, foreshortened to absolute bluntness, require a
delicacy in the rendering of them like that of the drawing of the hand
of the Magdalene upon the vase in Mr. Rogers's Titian. Get but the back
of that foliage, and you have the tree; but I cannot name the artist who
has thoroughly felt it. So, in all drawing and sculpture, it is the
power of rounding, softly and perfectly, every inferior mass which
preserves the serenity, as it follows the truth, of Nature, and which
demands the highest knowledge and skill from the workman. A noble design
may always be told by the back of a single leaf, and it was the
sacrifice of this breadth and refinement of surface for sharp edges and
extravagant undercutting, which destroyed the Gothic mouldings, as the
substitution of the line for the light destroyed the Gothic tracery.
This change, however, we shall better comprehend after we have glanced
at the chief conditions of arrangement of the second kind of mass; that
which is flat, and of shadow only.

  [Illustration: PLATE VI.--(Page 90--Vol. V.)
  ARCH FROM THE FAÇADE OF THE CHURCH OF SAN MICHELE AT LUCCA.]

XVIII. We have noted above how the wall surface, composed of rich
materials, and covered with costly work, in modes which we shall examine
in the next Chapter, became a subject of peculiar interest to the
Christian architects. Its broad flat lights could only be made valuable
by points or masses of energetic shadow, which were obtained by the
Romanesque architect by means of ranges of recessed arcade, in the
management of which, however, though all the effect depends upon the
shadow so obtained, the eye is still, as in classical architecture,
caused to dwell upon the projecting columns, capitals, and wall, as in
Plate VI. But with the enlargement of the window, which, in the Lombard
and Romanesque churches, is usually little more than an arched slit,
came the conception of the simpler mode of decoration, by penetrations
which, seen from within, are forms of light, and, from without, are
forms of shade. In Italian traceries the eye is exclusively fixed upon
the dark forms of the penetrations, and the whole proportion and power
of the design are caused to depend upon them. The intermediate spaces
are, indeed, in the most perfect early examples, filled with elaborate
ornament; but this ornament was so subdued as never to disturb the
simplicity and force of the dark masses; and in many instances is
entirely wanting. The composition of the whole depends on the
proportioning and shaping of the darks; and it is impossible that
anything can be more exquisite than their placing in the head window of
the Giotto campanile, Plate IX., or the church of Or San Michele. So
entirely does the effect depend upon them, that it is quite useless to
draw Italian tracery in outline; if with any intention of rendering its
effect, it is better to mark the black spots, and let the rest alone. Of
course, when it is desired to obtain an accurate rendering of the
design, its lines and mouldings are enough; but it often happens that
works on architecture are of little use, because they afford the reader
no means of judging of the effective intention of the arrangements which
they state. No person, looking at an architectural drawing of the richly
foliaged cusps and intervals of Or San Michele, would understand that
all this sculpture was extraneous, was a mere added grace, and had
nothing to do with the real anatomy of the work, and that by a few bold
cuttings through a slab of stone he might reach the main effect of it
all at once. I have, therefore, in the plate of the design of Giotto,
endeavored especially to mark these points of _purpose_; there, as in
every other instance, black shadows of a graceful form lying on the
white surface of the stone, like dark leaves laid upon snow. Hence, as
before observed, the universal name of foil applied to such ornaments.

XIX. In order to the obtaining their full effect, it is evident that
much caution is necessary in the management of the glass. In the finest
instances, the traceries are open lights, either in towers, as in this
design of Giotto's or in external arcades like that of the Campo Santo
at Pisa or the Doge's palace at Venice; and it is thus only that their
full beauty is shown. In domestic buildings, or in windows of churches
necessarily glazed, the glass was usually withdrawn entirely behind the
traceries. Those of the Cathedral of Florence stand quite clear of it,
casting their shadows in well detached lines, so as in most lights to
give the appearance of a double tracery. In those few instances in which
the glass was set in the tracery itself, as in Or San Michele, the
effect of the latter is half destroyed: perhaps the especial attention
paid by Orgagna to his surface ornament, was connected with the
intention of so glazing them. It is singular to see, in late
architecture, the glass, which tormented the older architects,
considered as a valuable means of making the lines of tracery more
slender; as in the smallest intervals of the windows of Merton College,
Oxford, where the glass is advanced about two inches from the centre of
the tracery bar (that in the larger spaces being in the middle, as
usual), in order to prevent the depth of shadow from farther diminishing
the apparent interval. Much of the lightness of the effect of the
traceries is owing to this seemingly unimportant arrangement. But,
generally speaking, glass spoils all traceries; and it is much to be
wished that it should be kept well within them, when it cannot be
dispensed with, and that the most careful and beautiful designs should
be reserved for situations where no glass would be needed.

  PIERCED ORNAMENTS FROM LISIEUX, BAYEUX, VERONA, AND PADUA.]

XX. The method of decoration by shadow was, as far as we have hitherto
traced it, common to the northern and southern Gothic. But in the
carrying out of the system they instantly diverged. Having marble at his
command, and classical decoration in his sight, the southern architect
was able to carve the intermediate spaces with exquisite leafage, or to
vary his wall surface with inlaid stones. The northern architect neither
knew the ancient work, nor possessed the delicate material; and he had
no resource but to cover his walls with holes, cut into foiled shapes
like those of the windows. This he did, often with great clumsiness, but
always with a vigorous sense of composition, and always, observe,
depending on the _shadows_ for effect. Where the wall was thick and
could not be cut through, and the foilings were large, those shadows
did not fill the entire space; but the form was, nevertheless, drawn on
the eye by means of them, and when it was possible, they were cut clear
through, as in raised screens of pediment, like those on the west front
of Bayeux; cut so deep in every case, as to secure, in all but a direct
low front light, great breadth of shadow.

The spandril, given at the top of Plate VII., is from the southwestern
entrance of the Cathedral of Lisieux; one of the most quaint and
interesting doors in Normandy, probably soon to be lost forever, by the
continuance of the masonic operations which have already destroyed the
northern tower. Its work is altogether rude, but full of spirit; the
opposite spandrils have different, though balanced, ornaments very
inaccurately adjusted, each rosette or star (as the five-rayed figure,
now quite defaced, in the upper portion appears to have been) cut on its
own block of stone and fitted in with small nicety, especially
illustrating the point I have above insisted upon--the architect's utter
neglect of the forms of intermediate stone, at this early period.

The arcade, of which a single arch and shaft are given on the left,
forms the flank of the door; three outer shafts bearing three orders
within the spandril which I have drawn, and each of these shafts carried
over an inner arcade, decorated above with quatre-foils, cut concave and
filled with leaves, the whole disposition exquisitely picturesque and
full of strange play of light and shade.

For some time the penetrative ornaments, if so they may be for
convenience called, maintained their bold and independent character.
Then they multiplied and enlarged, becoming shallower as they did so;
then they began to run together, one swallowing up, or hanging on to,
another, like bubbles in expiring foam--fig. 4, from a spandril at
Bayeux, looks as if it had been blown from a pipe; finally, they lost
their individual character altogether, and the eye was made to rest on
the separating lines of tracery, as we saw before in the window; and
then came the great change and the fall of the Gothic power.

XXI. Figs. 2 and 3, the one a quadrant of the star window of the little
chapel close to St. Anastasia at Verona, and the other a very singular
example from the church of the Eremitani at Padua, compared with fig. 5,
one of the ornaments of the transept towers of Rouen, show the closely
correspondent conditions of the early Northern and Southern Gothic.[10]
But, as we have said, the Italian architects, not being embarrassed for
decoration of wall surface, and not being obliged, like the Northmen, to
multiply their penetrations, held to the system for some time longer;
and while they increased the refinement of the ornament, kept the purity
of the plan. That refinement of ornament was their weak point, however,
and opened the way for the renaissance attack. They fell, like the old
Romans, by their luxury, except in the separate instance of the
magnificent school of Venice. That architecture began with the
luxuriance in which all others expired: it founded itself on the
Byzantine mosaic and fretwork; and laying aside its ornaments, one by
one, while it fixed its forms by laws more and more severe, stood forth,
at last, a model of domestic Gothic, so grand, so complete, so nobly
systematised, that, to my mind, there never existed an architecture with
so stern a claim to our reverence. I do not except even the Greek Doric;
the Doric had cast nothing away; the fourteenth century Venetian had
cast away, one by one, for a succession of centuries, every splendor
that art and wealth could give it. It had laid down its crown and its
jewels, its gold and its color, like a king disrobing; it had resigned
its exertion, like an athlete reposing; once capricious and fantastic,
it had bound itself by laws inviolable and serene as those of nature
herself. It retained nothing but its beauty and its power; both the
highest, but both restrained. The Doric flutings were of irregular
number--the Venetian mouldings were unchangeable. The Doric manner of
ornament admitted no temptation, it was the fasting of an anchorite--the
Venetian ornament embraced, while it governed, all vegetable and animal
forms; it was the temperance of a man, the command of Adam over
creation. I do not know so magnificent a marking of human authority as
the iron grasp of the Venetian over his own exuberance of
imagination; the calm and solemn restraint with which, his mind filled
with thoughts of flowing leafage and fiery life, he gives those thoughts
expression for an instant, and then withdraws within those massy bars
and level cusps of stone.[11]

  [Illustration: PLATE VIII.--(Page 95--Vol. V.)
  WINDOW FROM THE CA' FOSCARI, VENICE.]

And his power to do this depended altogether on his retaining the forms
of the shadows in his sight. Far from carrying the eye to the ornaments,
upon the stone, he abandoned these latter one by one; and while his
mouldings received the most shapely order and symmetry, closely
correspondent with that of the Rouen tracery, compare Plates III. and
VIII., he kept the cusps within them perfectly flat, decorated, if at
all, with a trefoil (Palazzo Foscari), or fillet (Doge's Palace) just
traceable and no more, so that the quatrefoil, cut as sharply through
them as if it had been struck out by a stamp, told upon the eye, with
all its four black leaves, miles away. No knots of flowerwork, no
ornaments of any kind, were suffered to interfere with the purity of its
form: the cusp is usually quite sharp; but slightly truncated in the
Palazzo Foscari, and charged with a simple ball in that of the Doge; and
the glass of the window, where there was any, was, as we have seen,
thrown back behind the stone-work, that no flashes of light might
interfere with its depth. Corrupted forms, like those of the Casa d'Oro
and Palazzo Pisani, and several others, only serve to show the majesty
of the common design.

XXII. Such are the principal circumstances traceable in the treatment of
the two kinds of masses of light and darkness, in the hands of the
earlier architects; gradation in the one, flatness in the other, and
breadth in both, being the qualities sought and exhibited by every
possible expedient, up to the period when, as we have before stated, the
line was substituted for the mass, as the means of division of surface.
Enough has been said to illustrate this, as regards tracery; but a word
or two is still necessary respecting the mouldings.

Those of the earlier times were, in the plurality of instances, composed
of alternate square and cylindrical shafts, variously associated and
proportioned. Where concave cuttings occur, as in the beautiful west
doors of Bayeux, they are between cylindrical shafts, which they throw
out into broad light. The eye in all cases dwells on broad surfaces, and
commonly upon few. In course of time, a low ridgy process is seen
emerging along the outer edge of the cylindrical shaft, forming a line
of light upon it and destroying its gradation. Hardly traceable at first
(as on the alternate rolls of the north door of Rouen), it grows and
pushes out as gradually as a stag's horns: sharp at first on the edge;
but, becoming prominent, it receives a truncation, and becomes a
definite fillet on the face of the roll. Not yet to be checked, it
pushes forward until the roll itself becomes subordinate to it, and is
finally lost in a slight swell upon its sides, while the concavities
have all the time been deepening and enlarging behind it, until, from a
succession of square or cylindrical masses, the whole moulding has
become a series of _concavities_ edged by delicate fillets, upon which
(sharp _lines_ of light, observe) the eye exclusively rests. While this
has been taking place, a similar, though less total, change has affected
the flowerwork itself. In Plate I. fig. 2 (_a_), I have given two from
the transepts of Rouen. It will be observed how absolutely the eye rests
on the forms of the leaves, and on the three berries in the angle, being
in light exactly what the trefoil is in darkness. These mouldings nearly
adhere to the stone; and are very slightly, though sharply, undercut. In
process of time, the attention of the architect, instead of resting on
the leaves, went to the _stalks_. These latter were elongated (_b_, from
the south door of St. Lo); and to exhibit them better, the deep
concavity was cut behind, so as to throw them out in lines of light. The
system was carried out into continually increasing intricacy, until, in
the transepts of Beauvais, we have brackets and flamboyant traceries,
composed of twigs without any leaves at all. This, however, is a
partial, though a sufficiently characteristic, caprice, the leaf being
never generally banished, and in the mouldings round those same doors,
beautifully managed, but itself rendered liny by bold marking of its
ribs and veins, and by turning up, and crisping its edges, large
intermediate spaces being always left to be occupied by intertwining
stems (_c_, from Caudebec). The trefoil of light formed by berries or
acorns, though diminished in value, was never lost up to the last period
of living Gothic.

XXIII. It is interesting to follow into its many ramifications, the
influence of the corrupting principle; but we have seen enough of it to
enable us to draw our practical conclusion--a conclusion a thousand
times felt and reiterated in the experience and advice of every
practised artist, but never often enough repeated, never profoundly
enough felt. Of composition and invention much has been written, it
seems to me vainly, for men cannot be taught to compose or to invent; of
these, the highest elements of Power in architecture, I do not,
therefore, speak; nor, here, of that peculiar restraint in the imitation
of natural forms, which constitutes the dignity of even the most
luxuriant work of the great periods. Of this restraint I shall say a
word or two in the next Chapter; pressing now only the conclusion, as
practically useful as it is certain, that the relative majesty of
buildings depends more on the weight and vigor of their masses than on
any other attribute of their design: mass of everything, of bulk, of
light, of darkness, of color, not mere sum of any of these, but breadth
of them; not broken light, nor scattered darkness, nor divided weight,
but solid stone, broad sunshine, starless shade. Time would fail me
altogether, if I attempted to follow out the range of the principle;
there is not a feature, however apparently trifling, to which it cannot
give power. The wooden fillings of belfry lights, necessary to protect
their interiors from rain, are in England usually divided into a number
of neatly executed cross-bars, like those of Venetian blinds, which, of
course, become as conspicuous in their sharpness as they are
uninteresting in their precise carpentry, multiplying, moreover, the
horizontal lines which directly contradict those of the architecture.
Abroad, such necessities are met by three or four downright penthouse
roofs, reaching each from within the window to the outside shafts of its
mouldings; instead of the horrible row of ruled lines, the space is thus
divided into four or five grand masses of shadow, with grey slopes of
roof above, bent or yielding into all kinds of delicious swells and
curves, and covered with warm tones of moss and lichen. Very often the
thing is more delightful than the stone-work itself, and all because it
is broad, dark, and simple. It matters not how clumsy, how common, the
means are, that get weight and shadow--sloping roof, jutting porch,
projecting balcony, hollow niche, massy gargoyle, frowning parapet; get
but gloom and simplicity, and all good things will follow in their place
and time; do but design with the owl's eyes first, and you will gain the
falcon's afterwards.

XXIV. I am grieved to have to insist upon what seems so simple; it looks
trite and commonplace when it is written, but pardon me this: for it is
anything but an accepted or understood principle in practice, and the
less excusably forgotten, because it is, of all the great and true laws
of art, the easiest to obey. The executive facility of complying with
its demands cannot be too earnestly, too frankly asserted. There are not
five men in the kingdom who could compose, not twenty who could cut, the
foliage with which the windows of Or San Michele are adorned; but there
is many a village clergyman who could invent and dispose its black
openings, and not a village mason who could not cut them. Lay a few
clover or wood-roof leaves on white paper, and a little alteration in
their positions will suggest figures which, cut boldly through a slab of
marble, would be worth more window traceries than an architect could
draw in a summer's day. There are few men in the world who could design
a Greek capital; there are few who could not produce some vigor of
effect with leaf designs on Byzantine block: few who could design a
Palladian front, or a flamboyant pediment; many who could build a square
mass like the Strozzi palace. But I know not how it is, unless that our
English hearts have more oak than stone in them, and have more filial
sympathy with acorns than Alps; but all that we do is small and mean, if
not worse--thin, and wasted, and unsubstantial. It is not modern work
only; we have built like frogs and mice since the thirteenth century
(except only in our castles). What a contrast between the pitiful little
pigeon-holes which stand for doors in the east front of Salisbury,
looking like the entrances to a beehive or a wasp's nest, and the
soaring arches and kingly crowning of the gates of Abbeville, Rouen, and
Rheims, or the rock-hewn piers of Chartres, or the dark and vaulted
porches and writhed pillars of Verona! Of domestic architecture what
need is there to speak? How small, how cramped, how poor, how miserable
in its petty neatness is our best! how beneath the mark of attack, and
the level of contempt, that which is common with us! What a strange
sense of formalised deformity, of shrivelled precision, of starved
accuracy, of minute misanthropy have we, as we leave even the rude
streets of Picardy for the market towns of Kent! Until that street
architecture of ours is bettered, until we give it some size and
boldness, until we give our windows recess, and our walls thickness, I
know not how we can blame our architects for their feebleness in more
important work; their eyes are inured to narrowness and slightness: can
we expect them at a word to conceive and deal with breadth and solidity?
They ought not to live in our cities; there is that in their miserable
walls which bricks up to death men's imaginations, as surely as ever
perished forsworn nun. An architect should live as little in cities as a
painter. Send him to our hills, and let him study there what nature
understands by a buttress, and what by a dome. There was something in
the old power of architecture, which it had from the recluse more than
from the citizen. The buildings of which I have spoken with chief
praise, rose, indeed, out of the war of the piazza, and above the fury
of the populace: and Heaven forbid that for such cause we should ever
have to lay a larger stone, or rivet a firmer bar, in our England! But
we have other sources of power, in the imagery of our iron coasts and
azure hills; of power more pure, nor less serene, than that of the
hermit spirit which once lighted with white lines of cloisters the
glades of the Alpine pine, and raised into ordered spires the wild rocks
of the Norman sea; which gave to the temple gate the depth and darkness
of Elijah's Horeb cave; and lifted, out of the populous city, grey
cliffs of lonely stone, into the midst of sailing birds and silent air.




CHAPTER IV.

THE LAMP OF BEAUTY.


I. It was stated, in the outset of the preceding chapter, that the value
of architecture depended on two distinct characters: the one, the
impression it receives from human power; the other, the image it bears
of the natural creation. I have endeavored to show in what manner its
majesty was attributable to a sympathy with the effort and trouble of
human life (a sympathy as distinctly perceived in the gloom and mystery
of form, as it is in the melancholy tones of sounds). I desire now to
trace that happier element of its excellence, consisting in a noble
rendering of images of Beauty, derived chiefly from the external
appearances of organic nature.

It is irrelevant to our present purpose to enter into any inquiry
respecting the essential causes of impressions of beauty. I have partly
expressed my thoughts on this matter in a previous work, and I hope to
develope them hereafter. But since all such inquiries can only be
founded on the ordinary understanding of what is meant by the term
Beauty, and since they presume that the feeling of mankind on this
subject is universal and instinctive, I shall base my present
investigation on this assumption; and only asserting that to be
beautiful which I believe will be granted me to be so without dispute, I
would endeavor shortly to trace the manner in which this element of
delight is to be best engrafted upon architectural design, what are the
purest sources from which it is to be derived, and what the errors to be
avoided in its pursuit.

II. It will be thought that I have somewhat rashly limited the elements
of architectural beauty to imitative forms. I do not mean to assert that
every arrangement of line is directly suggested by a natural object; but
that all beautiful lines are adaptations of those which are commonest in
the external creation; that in proportion to the richness of their
association, the resemblance to natural work, as a type and help, must
be more closely attempted, and more clearly seen; and that beyond a
certain point, and that a very low one, man cannot advance in the
invention of beauty, without directly imitating natural form. Thus, in
the Doric temple, the triglyph and cornice are unimitative; or imitative
only of artificial cuttings of wood. No one would call these members
beautiful. Their influence over us is in their severity and simplicity.
The fluting of the column, which I doubt not was the Greek symbol of the
bark of the tree, was imitative in its origin, and feebly resembled many
caniculated organic structures. Beauty is instantly felt in it, but of a
low order. The decoration proper was sought in the true forms of organic
life, and those chiefly human. Again: the Doric capital was unimitative;
but all the beauty it had was dependent on the precision of its ovolo, a
natural curve of the most frequent occurrence. The Ionic capital (to my
mind, as an architectural invention, exceedingly base) nevertheless
depended for all the beauty that it had on its adoption of a spiral
line, perhaps the commonest of all that characterise the inferior orders
of animal organism and habitation. Farther progress could not be made
without a direct imitation of the acanthus leaf.

Again: the Romanesque arch is beautiful as an abstract line. Its type is
always before us in that of the apparent vault of heaven, and horizon of
the earth. The cylindrical pillar is always beautiful, for God has so
moulded the stem of every tree that it is pleasant to the eyes. The
pointed arch is beautiful; it is the termination of every leaf that
shakes in summer wind, and its most fortunate associations are directly
borrowed from the trefoiled grass of the field, or from the stars of its
flowers. Further than this, man's invention could not reach without
frank imitation. His next step was to gather the flowers themselves, and
wreathe them in his capitals.

III. Now, I would insist especially on the fact, of which I doubt not
that further illustrations will occur to the mind of every reader, that
all most lovely forms and thoughts are directly taken from natural
objects; because I would fain be allowed to assume also the converse of
this, namely, that forms which are _not_ taken from natural objects
_must_ be ugly. I know this is a bold assumption; but as I have not
space to reason out the points wherein essential beauty of form
consists, that being far too serious a work to be undertaken in a bye
way, I have no other resource than to use this accidental mark or test
of beauty, of whose truth the considerations which I hope hereafter to
lay before the reader may assure him. I say an accidental mark, since
forms are not beautiful _because_ they are copied from nature; only it
is out of the power of man to conceive beauty without her aid. I believe
the reader will grant me this, even from the examples above advanced;
the degree of confidence with which it is granted must attach also to
his acceptance of the conclusions which will follow from it; but if it
be granted frankly, it will enable me to determine a matter of very
essential importance, namely, what _is_ or is _not_ ornament. For there
are many forms of so-called decoration in architecture, habitual, and
received, therefore, with approval, or at all events without any venture
at expression or dislike, which I have no hesitation in asserting to be
not ornament at all, but to be ugly things, the expense of which ought
in truth to be set down in the architect's contract, as "For
Monstrification." I believe that we regard these customary deformities
with a savage complacency, as an Indian does his flesh patterns and
paint (all nations being in certain degrees and senses savage). I
believe that I can prove them to be monstrous, and I hope hereafter to
do so conclusively; but, meantime, I can allege in defence of my
persuasion nothing but this fact of their being unnatural, to which the
reader must attach such weight as he thinks it deserves. There is,
however, a peculiar difficulty in using this proof; it requires the
writer to assume, very impertinently, that nothing is natural but what
he has seen or supposes to exist. I would not do this; for I suppose
there is no conceivable form or grouping of forms but in some part of
the universe an example of it may be found. But I think I am justified
in considering those forms to be _most_ natural which are most frequent;
or, rather, that on the shapes which in the every-day world are familiar
to the eyes of men, God has stamped those characters of beauty which He
has made it man's nature to love; while in certain exceptional forms He
has shown that the adoption of the others was not a matter of necessity,
but part of the adjusted harmony of creation. I believe that thus we may
reason from Frequency to Beauty and _vice versâ_; that knowing a thing
to be frequent, we may assume it to be beautiful; and assume that which
is most frequent to be most beautiful: I mean, of course, _visibly_
frequent; for the forms of things which are hidden in caverns of the
earth, or in the anatomy of animal frames, are evidently not intended by
their Maker to bear the habitual gaze of man. And, again, by frequency I
mean that limited and isolated frequency which is characteristic of all
perfection; not mere multitude: as a rose is a common flower, but yet
there are not so many roses on the tree as there are leaves. In this
respect Nature is sparing of her highest, and lavish of her less,
beauty; but I call the flower as frequent as the leaf, because, each in
its allotted quantity, where the one is, there will ordinarily be the
other.

IV. The first so-called ornament, then, which I would attack is that
Greek fret, now, I believe, usually known by the Italian name Guilloche,
which is exactly a case in point. It so happens that in crystals of
bismuth formed by the unagitated cooling of the melted metal, there
occurs a natural resemblance of it almost perfect. But crystals of
bismuth not only are of unusual occurrence in every-day life, but their
form is, as far as I know, unique among minerals; and not only unique,
but only attainable by an artificial process, the metal itself never
being found pure. I do not remember any other substance or arrangement
which presents a resemblance to this Greek ornament; and I think that I
may trust my remembrance as including most of the arrangements which
occur in the outward forms of common and familiar things. On this
ground, then, I allege that ornament to be ugly; or, in the literal
sense of the word, monstrous; different from anything which it is the
nature of man to admire: and I think an uncarved fillet or plinth
infinitely preferable to one covered with this vile concatenation of
straight lines: unless indeed it be employed as a foil to a true
ornament, which it may, perhaps, sometimes with advantage; or
excessively small, as it occurs on coins, the harshness of its
arrangement being less perceived.

V. Often in association with this horrible design we find, in Greek
works, one which is as beautiful as this is painful--that egg and dart
moulding, whose perfection in its place and way, has never been
surpassed. And why is this? Simply because the form of which it is
chiefly composed is one not only familiar to us in the soft housing of
the bird's nest, but happens to be that of nearly every pebble that
rolls and murmurs under the surf of the sea, on all its endless shore.
And with that a peculiar accuracy; for the mass which bears the light in
this moulding is _not_ in good Greek work, as in the frieze of the
Erechtheum, merely of the shape of an egg. It is _flattened_ on the
upper surface, with a delicacy and keen sense of variety in the curve
which it is impossible too highly to praise, attaining exactly that
flattened, imperfect oval, which, in nine cases out of ten, will be the
form of the pebble lifted at random from the rolled beach. Leave out
this flatness, and the moulding is vulgar instantly. It is singular also
that the insertion of this rounded form in the hollow recess has a
_painted_ type in the plumage of the Argus pheasant, the eyes of whose
feathers are so shaded as exactly to represent an oval form placed in a
hollow.

VI. It will evidently follow, upon our application of this test of
natural resemblance, that we shall at once conclude that all perfectly
beautiful forms must be composed of curves; since there is hardly any
common natural form in which it is possible to discover a straight line.
Nevertheless, Architecture, having necessarily to deal with straight
lines essential to its purposes in many instances and to the expression
of its power in others, must frequently be content with that measure of
beauty which is consistent with such primal forms; and we may presume
that utmost measure of beauty to have been attained when the
arrangements of such lines are consistent with the most frequent natural
groupings of them we can discover, although, to find right lines in
nature at all, we may be compelled to do violence to her finished work,
break through the sculptured and colored surfaces of her crags, and
examine the processes of their crystallisation.

VII. I have just convicted the Greek fret of ugliness, because it has no
precedent to allege for its arrangement except an artificial form of a
rare metal. Let us bring into court an ornament of Lombard architects,
Plate XII., fig. 7, as exclusively composed of right lines as the other,
only, observe, with the noble element of shadow added. This ornament,
taken from the front of the Cathedral of Pisa, is universal throughout
the Lombard churches of Pisa, Lucca, Pistoja, and Florence; and it will
be a grave stain upon them if it cannot be defended. Its first apology
for itself, made in a hurry, sounds marvellously like the Greek one, and
highly dubious. It says that its terminal contour is the very image of a
carefully prepared artificial crystal of common salt. Salt being,
however, a substance considerably more familiar to us than bismuth, the
chances are somewhat in favor of the accused Lombard ornament already.
But it has more to say for itself, and more to the purpose; namely, that
its main outline is one not only of natural crystallisation, but among
the very first and commonest of crystalline forms, being the primal
condition of the occurrence of the oxides of iron, copper, and tin, of
the sulphurets of iron and lead, of fluor spar, &c.; and that those
projecting forms in its surface represent the conditions of structure
which effect the change into another relative and equally common
crystalline form, the cube. This is quite enough. We may rest assured it
is as good a combination of such simple right lines as can be put
together, and gracefully fitted for every place in which such lines are
necessary.

VIII. The next ornament whose cause I would try is that of our Tudor
work, the portcullis. Reticulation is common enough in natural form, and
very beautiful; but it is either of the most delicate and gauzy texture,
or of variously sized meshes and undulating lines. There is no family
relation between portcullis and cobwebs or beetles' wings; something
like it, perhaps, may be found in some kinds of crocodile armor and on
the backs of the Northern divers, but always beautifully varied in size
of mesh. There is a dignity in the thing itself, if its size were
exhibited, and the shade given through its bars; but even these merits
are taken away in the Tudor diminution of it, set on a solid surface. It
has not a single syllable, I believe, to say in its defence. It is
another monster, absolutely and unmitigatedly frightful. All that
carving on Henry the Seventh's Chapel simply deforms the stones of it.

In the same clause with the portcullis, we may condemn all heraldic
decoration, so far as beauty is its object. Its pride and significance
have their proper place, fitly occurring in prominent parts of the
building, as over its gates; and allowably in places where its legendary
may be plainly read, as in painted windows, bosses of ceilings, &c. And
sometimes, of course, the forms which it presents may be beautiful, as
of animals, or simple symbols like the fleur-de-lis; but, for the most
part, heraldic similitudes and arrangements are so professedly and
pointedly unnatural, that it would be difficult to invent anything
uglier; and the use of them as a repeated decoration will utterly
destroy both the power and beauty of any building. Common sense and
courtesy also forbid their repetition. It is right to tell those who
enter your doors that you are such a one, and of such a rank; but to
tell it to them again and again, wherever they turn, becomes soon
impertinence, and at last folly. Let, therefore, the entire bearings
occur in few places, and these not considered as an ornament, but as an
inscription; and for frequent appliance, let any single and fair symbol
be chosen out of them. Thus we may multiply as much as we choose the
French fleur-de-lis, or the Florentine giglio bianco, or the English
rose; but we must not multiply a King's arms.

IX. It will also follow, from these considerations, that if any one part
of heraldic decoration be worse than another, it is the motto; since, of
all things unlike nature, the forms of letters are, perhaps, the most
so. Even graphic tellurium and felspar look, at their clearest, anything
but legible. All letters are, therefore, to be considered as frightful
things, and to be endured only upon occasion; that is to say, in places
where the sense of the inscription is of more importance than external
ornament. Inscriptions in churches, in rooms, and on pictures, are often
desirable, but they are not to be considered as architectural or
pictorial ornaments: they are, on the contrary, obstinate offences to
the eye, not to be suffered except when their intellectual office
introduces them. Place them, therefore, where they will be read, and
there only; and let them be plainly written, and not turned upside down,
nor wrong end first. It is an ill sacrifice to beauty to make that
illegible whose only merit is in its sense. Write it as you would speak
it, simply; and do not draw the eye to it when it would fain rest
elsewhere, nor recommend your sentence by anything but a little openness
of place and architectural silence about it. Write the Commandments on
the Church walls where they may be plainly seen, but do not put a dash
and a tail to every letter; and remember that you are an architect, not
a writing master.

X. Inscriptions appear sometimes to be introduced for the sake of the
scroll on which they are written; and in late and modern painted glass,
as well as in architecture, these scrolls are flourished and turned
hither and thither as if they were ornamental. Ribands occur frequently
in arabesques,--in some of a high order, too,--tying up flowers, or
flitting in and out among the fixed forms. Is there anything like
ribands in nature? It might be thought that grass and sea-weed afforded
apologetic types. They do not. There is a wide difference between their
structure and that of a riband. They have a skeleton, an anatomy, a
central rib, or fibre, or framework of some kind or another, which has a
beginning and an end, a root and head, and whose make and strength
effects every direction of their motion, and every line of their form.
The loosest weed that drifts and waves under the heaving of the sea, or
hangs heavily on the brown and slippery shore, has a marked strength,
structure, elasticity, gradation of substance; its extremities are more
finely fibred than its centre, its centre than its root; every fork of
its ramification is measured and proportioned; every wave of its languid
lines is love. It has its allotted size, and place, and function; it is
a specific creature. What is there like this in a riband? It has no
structure: it is a succession of cut threads all alike; it has no
skeleton, no make, no form, no size, no will of its own. You cut it and
crush it into what you will. It has no strength, no languor. It cannot
fall into a single graceful form. It cannot wave, in the true sense, but
only flutter: it cannot bend, in the true sense, but only turn and be
wrinkled. It is a vile thing; it spoils all that is near its wretched
film of an existence. Never use it. Let the flowers come loose if they
cannot keep together without being tied; leave the sentence unwritten if
you cannot write it on a tablet or book, or plain roll of paper. I know
what authority there is against me. I remember the scrolls of Perugino's
angels, and the ribands of Raphael's arabesques, and of Ghiberti's
glorious bronze flowers: no matter; they are every one of them vices and
uglinesses. Raphael usually felt this, and used an honest and rational
tablet, as in the Madonna di Fuligno. I do not say there is any type of
such tablets in nature, but all the difference lies in the fact that the
tablet is not considered as an ornament, and the riband, or flying
scroll, is. The tablet, as in Albert Durer's Adam and Eve, is introduced
for the sake of the writing, understood and allowed as an ugly but
necessary interruption. The scroll is extended as an ornamental form,
which it is not, nor ever can be.

XI. But it will be said that all this want of organisation and form
might be affirmed of drapery also, and that this latter is a noble
subject of sculpture. By no means. When was drapery a subject of
sculpture by itself, except in the form of a handkerchief on urns in the
seventeenth century and in some of the baser scenic Italian decorations?
Drapery, as such, is always ignoble; it becomes a subject of interest
only by the colors it bears, and the impressions which it receives from
some foreign form or force. All noble draperies, either in painting or
sculpture (color and texture being at present out of our consideration),
have, so far as they are anything more than necessities, one of two
great functions; they are the exponents of motion and of gravitation.
They are the most valuable means of expressing past as well as present
motion in the figure, and they are almost the only means of indicating
to the eye the force of gravity which resists such motion. The Greeks
used drapery in sculpture for the most part as an ugly necessity, but
availed themselves of it gladly in all representation of action,
exaggerating the arrangements of it which express lightness in the
material, and follow gesture in the person. The Christian sculptors,
caring little for the body, or disliking it, and depending exclusively
on the countenance, received drapery at first contentedly as a veil, but
soon perceived a capacity of expression in it which the Greek had not
seen or had despised. The principal element of this expression was the
entire removal of agitation from what was so pre-eminently capable of
being agitated. It fell from their human forms plumb down, sweeping the
ground heavily, and concealing the feet; while the Greek drapery was
often blown away from the thigh. The thick and coarse stuffs of the
monkish dresses, so absolutely opposed to the thin and gauzy web of
antique material, suggested simplicity of division as well as weight of
fall. There was no crushing nor subdividing them. And thus the drapery
gradually came to represent the spirit of repose as it before had of
motion, repose saintly and severe. The wind had no power upon the
garment, as the passion none upon the soul; and the motion of the figure
only bent into a softer line the stillness of the falling veil, followed
by it like a slow cloud by drooping rain: only in links of lighter
undulation it followed the dances of the angels.

Thus treated, drapery is indeed noble; but it is as an exponent of other
and higher things. As that of gravitation, it has especial majesty,
being literally the only means we have of fully representing this
mysterious natural force of earth (for falling water is less passive and
less defined in its lines). So, again, in sails it is beautiful because
it receives the forms of solid curved surface, and expresses the force
of another invisible element. But drapery trusted to its own merits, and
given for its own sake,--drapery like that of Carlo Dolci and the
Caraccis,--is always base.

XII. Closely connected with the abuse of scrolls and bands, is that of
garlands and festoons of flowers as an architectural decoration, for
unnatural arrangements are just as ugly as unnatural forms; and
architecture, in borrowing the objects of nature, is bound to place
them, as far as may be in her power, in such associations as may befit
and express their origin. She is not to imitate directly the natural
arrangement; she is not to carve irregular stems of ivy up her columns
to account for the leaves at the top, but she is nevertheless to place
her most exuberant vegetable ornament just where Nature would have
placed it, and to give some indication of that radical and connected
structure which Nature would have given it. Thus the Corinthian capital
is beautiful, because it expands under the abacus just as Nature would
have expanded it; and because it looks as if the leaves had one root,
though that root is unseen. And the flamboyant leaf mouldings are
beautiful, because they nestle and run up the hollows, and fill the
angles, and clasp the shafts which natural leaves would have delighted
to fill and to clasp. They are no mere cast of natural leaves; they are
counted, orderly, and architectural: but they are naturally, and
therefore beautifully, placed.

XIII. Now I do not mean to say that Nature never uses festoons: she
loves them, and uses them lavishly; and though she does so only in those
places of excessive luxuriance wherein it seems to me that architectural
types should seldom be sought, yet a falling tendril or pendent bough
might, if managed with freedom and grace, be well introduced into
luxuriant decoration (or if not, it is not their want of beauty, but of
architectural fitness, which incapacitates them for such uses). But what
resemblance to such example can we trace in a mass of all manner of
fruit and flowers, tied heavily into a long bunch, thickest in the
middle, and pinned up by both ends against a dead wall? For it is
strange that the wildest and most fanciful of the builders of truly
luxuriant architecture never ventured, so far as I know, even a pendent
tendril; while the severest masters of the revived Greek permitted this
extraordinary piece of luscious ugliness to be fastened in the middle of
their blank surfaces. So surely as this arrangement is adopted, the
whole value of the flower work is lost. Who among the crowds that gaze
upon the building ever pause to admire the flower work of St. Paul's?
It is as careful and as rich as it can be, yet it adds no delightfulness
to the edifice. It is no part of it. It is an ugly excrescence. We
always conceive the building without it, and should be happier if our
conception were not disturbed by its presence. It makes the rest of the
architecture look poverty-stricken, instead of sublime; and yet it is
never enjoyed itself. Had it been put, where it ought, into the
capitals, it would have been beheld with never-ceasing delight. I do not
mean that it could have been so in the present building, for such kind
of architecture has no business with rich ornament in any place; but
that if those groups of flowers had been put into natural places in an
edifice of another style, their value would have been felt as vividly as
now their uselessness. What applies to festoons is still more sternly
true of garlands. A garland is meant to be seen upon a head. There it is
beautiful, because we suppose it newly gathered and joyfully worn. But
it is not meant to be hung upon a wall. If you want a circular ornament,
put a flat circle of colored marble, as in the Casa Doria and other such
palaces at Venice; or put a star, or a medallion, or if you want a ring,
put a solid one, but do not carve the images of garlands, looking as if
they had been used in the last procession, and been hung up to dry, and
serve next time withered. Why not also carve pegs, and hats upon them?

XIV. One of the worst enemies of modern Gothic architecture, though
seemingly an unimportant feature, is an excrescence, as offensive by its
poverty as the garland by its profusion, the dripstone in the shape of
the handle of a chest of drawers, which is used over the square-headed
windows of what we call Elizabethan buildings. In the last Chapter, it
will be remembered that the square form was shown to be that of
pre-eminent Power, and to be properly adapted and limited to the
exhibition of space or surface. Hence, when the window is to be an
exponent of power, as for instance in those by M. Angelo in the lower
story of the Palazzo Ricardi at Florence, the square head is the most
noble form they can assume; but then either their space must be
unbroken, and their associated mouldings the most severe, or else the
square must be used as a finial outline, and is chiefly to be
associated with forms of tracery, in which the relative form of power,
the circle, is predominant, as in Venetian, and Florentine, and Pisan
Gothic. But if you break upon your terminal square, or if you cut its
lines off at the top and turn them outwards, you have lost its unity and
space. It is an including form no longer, but an added, isolated line,
and the ugliest possible. Look abroad into the landscape and see if you
can discover any one so bent and fragmentary as that of this strange
windlass-looking dripstone. You cannot. It is a monster. It unites every
element of ugliness, its line is harshly broken in itself, and
unconnected with every other; it has no harmony either with structure or
decoration, it has no architectural support, it looks glued to the wall,
and the only pleasant property it has, is the appearance of some
likelihood of its dropping off.

I might proceed, but the task is a weary one, and I think I have named
those false forms of decoration which are most dangerous in our modern
architecture as being legal and accepted. The barbarisms of individual
fancy are as countless as they are contemptible; they neither admit
attack nor are worth it; but these above named are countenanced, some by
the practice of antiquity, all by high authority: they have depressed
the proudest, and contaminated the purest schools, and are so
established in recent practice that I write rather for the barren
satisfaction of bearing witness against them, than with hope of inducing
any serious convictions to their prejudice.

XV. Thus far of what is _not_ ornament. What ornament is, will without
difficulty be determined by the application of the same test. It must
consist of such studious arrangements of form as are imitative or
suggestive of those which are commonest among natural existences, that
being of course the noblest ornament which represents the highest orders
of existence. Imitated flowers are nobler than imitated stones, imitated
animals, than flowers; imitated human form of all animal forms the
noblest. But all are combined in the richest ornamental work; and the
rock, the fountain, the flowing river with its pebbled bed, the sea, the
clouds of Heaven, the herb of the field, the fruit-tree bearing fruit,
the creeping thing, the bird, the beast, the man, and the angel, mingle
their fair forms on the bronze of Ghiberti.

Every thing being then ornamental that is imitative, I would ask the
reader's attention to a few general considerations, all that can here be
offered relating to so vast a subject; which, for convenience sake, may
be classed under the three heads of inquiry:--What is the right place
for architectural ornament? What is the peculiar treatment of ornament
which renders it architectural? and what is the right use of color as
associated with architectural imitative form?

XVI. What is the place of ornament? Consider first that the characters
of natural objects which the architect can represent are few and
abstract. The greater part of those delights by which Nature recommends
herself to man at all times, cannot be conveyed by him into his
imitative work. He cannot make his grass green and cool and good to rest
upon, which in nature is its chief use to man; nor can he make his
flowers tender and full of color and of scent, which in nature are their
chief powers of giving joy. Those qualities which alone he can secure
are certain severe characters of form, such as men only see in nature on
deliberate examination, and by the full and set appliance of sight and
thought: a man must lie down on the bank of grass on his breast and set
himself to watch and penetrate the intertwining of it, before he finds
that which is good to be gathered by the architect. So then while Nature
is at all times pleasant to us, and while the sight and sense of her
work may mingle happily with all our thoughts, and labors, and times of
existence, that image of her which the architect carries away represents
what we can only perceive in her by direct intellectual exertion, and
demands from us, wherever it appears, an intellectual exertion of a
similar kind in order to understand it and feel it. It is the written or
sealed impression of a thing sought out, it is the shaped result of
inquiry and bodily expression of thought.

XVII. Now let us consider for an instant what would be the effect of
continually repeating an expression of a beautiful thought to any other
of the senses at times when the mind could not address that sense to the
understanding of it. Suppose that in time of serious occupation, of
stern business, a companion should repeat in our ears continually some
favorite passage of poetry, over and over again all day long. We should
not only soon be utterly sick and weary of the sound of it, but that
sound would at the end of the day have so sunk into the habit of the ear
that the entire meaning of the passage would be dead to us, and it would
ever thenceforward require some effort to fix and recover it. The music
of it would not meanwhile have aided the business in hand, while its own
delightfulness would thenceforward be in a measure destroyed. It is the
same with every other form of definite thought. If you violently present
its expression to the senses, at times when the mind is otherwise
engaged, that expression will be ineffective at the time, and will have
its sharpness and clearness destroyed forever. Much more if you present
it to the mind at times when it is painfully affected or disturbed, or
if you associate the expression of pleasant thought with incongruous
circumstances, you will affect that expression thenceforward with a
painful color for ever.

XVIII. Apply this to expressions of thought received by the eye.
Remember that the eye is at your mercy more than the ear. "The eye it
cannot choose but see." Its nerve is not so easily numbed as that of the
ear, and it is often busied in tracing and watching forms when the ear
is at rest. Now if you present lovely forms to it when it cannot call
the mind to help it in its work, and among objects of vulgar use and
unhappy position, you will neither please the eye nor elevate the vulgar
object. But you will fill and weary the eye with the beautiful form, and
you will infect that form itself with the vulgarity of the thing to
which you have violently attached it. It will never be of much use to
you any more; you have killed or defiled it; its freshness and purity
are gone. You will have to pass it through the fire of much thought
before you will cleanse it, and warm it with much love before it will
revive.

XIX. Hence then a general law, of singular importance in the present
day, a law of simple common sense,--not to decorate things belonging to
purposes of active and occupied life. Wherever you can rest, there
decorate; where rest is forbidden, so is beauty. You must not mix
ornament with business, any more than you may mix play. Work first, and
then rest. Work first and then gaze, but do not use golden ploughshares,
nor bind ledgers in enamel. Do not thrash with sculptured flails: nor
put bas-reliefs on millstones. What! it will be asked, are we in the
habit of doing so? Even so; always and everywhere. The most familiar
position of Greek mouldings is in these days on shop fronts. There is
not a tradesman's sign nor shelf nor counter in all the streets of all
our cities, which has not upon it ornaments which were invented to adorn
temples and beautify kings' palaces. There is not the smallest advantage
in them where they are. Absolutely valueless--utterly without the power
of giving pleasure, they only satiate the eye, and vulgarise their own
forms. Many of these are in themselves thoroughly good copies of fine
things, which things themselves we shall never, in consequence, enjoy
any more. Many a pretty beading and graceful bracket there is in wood or
stucco above our grocers' and cheese-mongers' and hosiers' shops: how it
is that the tradesmen cannot understand that custom is to be had only by
selling good tea and cheese and cloth, and that people come to them for
their honesty, and their readiness, and their right wares, and not
because they have Greek cornices over their windows, or their names in
large gilt letters on their house fronts? how pleasurable it would be to
have the power of going through the streets of London, pulling down
those brackets and friezes and large names, restoring to the tradesmen
the capital they had spent in architecture, and putting them on honest
and equal terms, each with his name in black letters over his door, not
shouted down the street from the upper stories, and each with a plain
wooden shop casement, with small panes in it that people would not think
of breaking in order to be sent to prison! How much better for them
would it be--how much happier, how much wiser, to put their trust upon
their own truth and industry, and not on the idiocy of their customers.
It is curious, and it says little for our national probity on the one
hand, or prudence on the other, to see the whole system of our street
decoration based on the idea that people must be baited to a shop as
moths are to a candle.

XX. But it will be said that much of the best wooden decoration of the
middle ages was in shop fronts. No; it was in _house_ fronts, of which
the shop was a part, and received its natural and consistent portion of
the ornament. In those days men lived, and intended to live _by_ their
shops, and over them, all their days. They were contented with them and
happy in them: they were their palaces and castles. They gave them
therefore such decoration as made themselves happy in their own
habitation, and they gave it for their own sake. The upper stories were
always the richest, and the shop was decorated chiefly about the door,
which belonged to the house more than to it. And when our tradesmen
settle to their shops in the same way, and form no plans respecting
future villa architecture, let their whole houses be decorated, and
their shops too, but with a national and domestic decoration (I shall
speak more of this point in the sixth chapter). However, our cities are
for the most part too large to admit of contented dwelling in them
throughout life; and I do not say there is harm in our present system of
separating the shop from the dwelling-house; only where they are so
separated, let us remember that the only reason for shop decoration is
removed, and see that the decoration be removed also.

XXI. Another of the strange and evil tendencies of the present day is to
the decoration of the railroad station. Now, if there be any place in
the world in which people are deprived of that portion of temper and
discretion which are necessary to the contemplation of beauty, it is
there. It is the very temple of discomfort, and the only charity that
the builder can extend to us is to show us, plainly as may be, how
soonest to escape from it. The whole system of railroad travelling is
addressed to people who, being in a hurry, are therefore, for the time
being, miserable. No one would travel in that manner who could help
it--who had time to go leisurely over hills and between hedges, instead
of through tunnels and between banks: at least those who would, have no
sense of beauty so acute as that we need consult it at the station. The
railroad is in all its relations a matter of earnest business, to be got
through as soon as possible. It transmutes a man from a traveller into a
living parcel. For the time he has parted with the nobler
characteristics of his humanity for the sake of a planetary power of
locomotion. Do not ask him to admire anything. You might as well ask the
wind. Carry him safely, dismiss him soon: he will thank you for nothing
else. All attempts to please him in any other way are mere mockery, and
insults to the things by which you endeavor to do so. There never was
more flagrant nor impertinent folly than the smallest portion of
ornament in anything concerned with railroads or near them. Keep them
out of the way, take them through the ugliest country you can find,
confess them the miserable things they are, and spend nothing upon them
but for safety and speed. Give large salaries to efficient servants,
large prices to good manufacturers, large wages to able workmen; let the
iron be tough, and the brickwork solid, and the carriages strong. The
time is perhaps not distant when these first necessities may not be
easily met: and to increase expense in any other direction is madness.
Better bury gold in the embankments, than put it in ornaments on the
stations. Will a single traveller be willing to pay an increased fare on
the South Western, because the columns of the terminus are covered with
patterns from Nineveh? He will only care less for the Ninevite ivories
in the British Museum: or on the North Western, because there are old
English-looking spandrils to the roof of the station at Crewe? He will
only have less pleasure in their prototypes at Crewe House. Railroad
architecture has or would have a dignity of its own if it were only left
to its work. You would not put rings on the fingers of a smith at his
anvil.

XXII. It is not however only in these marked situations that the abuse
of which I speak takes place. There is hardly, at present, an
application of ornamental work, which is not in some sort liable to
blame of the same kind. We have a bad habit of trying to disguise
disagreeable necessities by some form of sudden decoration, which is, in
all other places, associated with such necessities. I will name only one
instance, that to which I have alluded before--the roses which conceal
the ventilators in the flat roofs of our chapels. Many of those roses
are of very beautiful design, borrowed from fine works: all their grace
and finish are invisible when they are so placed, but their general form
is afterwards associated with the ugly buildings in which they
constantly occur; and all the beautiful roses of the early French and
English Gothic, especially such elaborate ones as those of the triforium
of Coutances, are in consequence deprived of their pleasurable
influence: and this without our having accomplished the smallest good by
the use we have made of the dishonored form. Not a single person in the
congregation ever receives one ray of pleasure from those roof roses;
they are regarded with mere indifference, or lost in the general
impression of harsh emptiness.

XXIII. Must not beauty, then, it will be asked, be sought for in the
forms which we associate with our every-day life? Yes, if you do it
consistently, and in places where it can be calmly seen; but not if you
use the beautiful form only as a mask and covering of the proper
conditions and uses of things, nor if you thrust it into the places set
apart for toil. Put it in the drawing-room, not into the workshop; put
it upon domestic furniture, not upon tools of handicraft. All men have
sense of what is right in this manner, if they would only use and apply
that sense; every man knows where and how beauty gives him pleasure, if
he would only ask for it when it does so, and not allow it to be forced
upon him when he does not want it. Ask any one of the passengers over
London Bridge at this instant whether he cares about the forms of the
bronze leaves on its lamps, and he will tell you, No. Modify these forms
of leaves to a less scale, and put them on his milk-jug at breakfast,
and ask him whether he likes them, and he will tell you, Yes. People
have no need of teaching if they could only think and speak truth, and
ask for what they like and want, and for nothing else: nor can a right
disposition of beauty be ever arrived at except by this common sense,
and allowance for the circumstances of the time and place. It does not
follow, because bronze leafage is in bad taste on the lamps of London
Bridge, that it would be so on those of the Ponte della Trinita; nor,
because it would be a folly to decorate the house fronts of Gracechurch
Street, that it would be equally so to adorn those of some quiet
provincial town. The question of greatest external or internal
decoration depends entirely on the conditions of probable repose. It was
a wise feeling which made the streets of Venice so rich in external
ornament, for there is no couch of rest like the gondola. So, again,
there is no subject of street ornament so wisely chosen as the fountain,
where it is a fountain of use; for it is just there that perhaps the
happiest pause takes place in the labor of the day, when the pitcher is
rested on the edge of it, and the breath of the bearer is drawn deeply,
and the hair swept from the forehead, and the uprightness of the form
declined against the marble ledge, and the sound of the kind word or
light laugh mixes with the trickle of the falling water, heard shriller
and shriller as the pitcher fills. What pause is so sweet as that--so
full of the depth of ancient days, so softened with the calm of pastoral
solitude?

XXIV. II. Thus far, then, of the place for beauty. We were next to
inquire into the characters which fitted it peculiarly for architectural
appliance, and into the principles of choice and of arrangement which
best regulate the imitation of natural forms in which it consists. The
full answering of these questions would be a treatise on the art of
design: I intend only to say a few words respecting the two conditions
of that art which are essentially architectural,--Proportion and
Abstraction. Neither of these qualities is necessary, to the same
extent, in other fields of design. The sense of proportion is, by the
landscape painter, frequently sacrificed to character and accident; the
power of abstraction to that of complete realisation. The flowers of his
foreground must often be unmeasured in their quantity, loose in their
arrangement: what is calculated, either in quantity or disposition,
must be artfully concealed. That calculation is by the architect to be
prominently exhibited. So the abstraction of few characteristics out of
many is shown only in the painter's sketch; in his finished work it is
concealed or lost in completion. Architecture, on the contrary, delights
in Abstraction and fears to complete her forms. Proportion and
Abstraction, then, are the two especial marks of architectural design as
distinguished from all other. Sculpture must have them in inferior
degrees; leaning, on the one hand, to an architectural manner, when it
is usually greatest (becoming, indeed, a part of Architecture), and, on
the other, to a pictorial manner, when it is apt to lose its dignity,
and sink into mere ingenious carving.

XXV. Now, of Proportion so much has been written, that I believe the
only facts which are of practical use have been overwhelmed and kept out
of sight by vain accumulations of particular instances and estimates.
Proportions are as infinite (and that in all kinds of things, as
severally in colors, lines, shades, lights, and forms) as possible airs
in music: and it is just as rational an attempt to teach a young
architect how to proportion truly and well by calculating for him the
proportions of fine works, as it would be to teach him to compose
melodies by calculating the mathematical relations of the notes in
Beethoven's Adelaïde or Mozart's Requiem. The man who has eye and
intellect will invent beautiful proportions, and cannot help it; but he
can no more tell _us_ how to do it than Wordsworth could tell us how to
write a sonnet, or than Scott could have told us how to plan a romance.
But there are one or two general laws which can be told: they are of no
use, indeed, except as preventives of gross mistake, but they are so far
worth telling and remembering; and the more so because, in the
discussion of the subtle laws of proportion (which will never be either
numbered or known), architects are perpetually forgetting and
transgressing the very simplest of its necessities.

XXVI. Of which the first is, that wherever Proportion exists at all, one
member of the composition must be either larger than, or in some way
supreme over, the rest. There is no proportion between equal things.
They can have symmetry only, and symmetry without proportion is not
composition. It is necessary to perfect beauty, but it is the least
necessary of its elements, nor of course is there any difficulty in
obtaining it. Any succession of equal things is agreeable; but to
compose is to arrange unequal things, and the first thing to be done in
beginning a composition is to determine which is to be the principal
thing. I believe that all that has been written and taught about
proportion, put together, is not to the architect worth the single rule,
well enforced, "Have one large thing and several smaller things, or one
principal thing and several inferior things, and bind them well
together." Sometimes there may be a regular gradation, as between the
heights of stories in good designs for houses; sometimes a monarch with
a lowly train, as in the spire with its pinnacles: the varieties of
arrangement are infinite, but the law is universal--have one thing above
the rest, either by size, or office, or interest. Don't put the
pinnacles without the spire. What a host of ugly church towers have we
in England, with pinnacles at the corners, and none in the middle! How
many buildings like King's College Chapel at Cambridge, looking like
tables upside down, with their four legs in the air! What! it will be
said, have not beasts four legs? Yes, but legs of different shapes, and
with a head between them. So they have a pair of ears: and perhaps a
pair of horns: but not at both ends. Knock down a couple of pinnacles at
either end in King's College Chapel, and you will have a kind of
proportion instantly. So in a cathedral you may have one tower in the
centre, and two at the west end; or two at the west end only, though a
worse arrangement: but you must not have two at the west and two at the
east end, unless you have some central member to connect them; and even
then, buildings are generally bad which have large balancing features at
the extremities, and small connecting ones in the centre, because it is
not easy then to make the centre dominant. The bird or moth may indeed
have wide wings, because the size of the wing does not give supremacy to
the wing. The head and life are the mighty things, and the plumes,
however wide, are subordinate. In fine west fronts with a pediment and
two towers, the centre is always the principal mass, both in bulk and
interest (as having the main gateway), and the towers are subordinated
to it, as an animal's horns are to its head. The moment the towers rise
so high as to overpower the body and centre, and become themselves the
principal masses, they will destroy the proportion, unless they are made
unequal, and one of them the leading feature of the cathedral, as at
Antwerp and Strasburg. But the purer method is to keep them down in due
relation to the centre, and to throw up the pediment into a steep
connecting mass, drawing the eye to it by rich tracery. This is nobly
done in St. Wulfran of Abbeville, and attempted partly at Rouen, though
that west front is made up of so many unfinished and supervening designs
that it is impossible to guess the real intention of any one of its
builders.

  [Illustration: PLATE X.--(Page 122--Vol. V.)
  TRACERIES AND MOULDINGS FROM ROUEN AND SALISBURY.]

XXVII. This rule of supremacy applies to the smallest as well as to the
leading features: it is interestingly seen in the arrangement of all
good mouldings. I have given one, on the opposite page, from Rouen
cathedral; that of the tracery before distinguished as a type of the
noblest manner of Northern Gothic (Chap. II. § XXII.). It is a tracery
of three orders, of which the first is divided into a leaf moulding,
fig. 4, and _b_ in the section, and a plain roll, also seen in fig. 4,
_c_ in the section; these two divisions surround the entire window or
panelling, and are carried by two-face shafts of corresponding sections.
The second and third orders are plain rolls following the line of the
tracery; four divisions of moulding in all: of these four, the leaf
moulding is, as seen in the sections, much the largest; next to it the
outer roll; then, by an exquisite alternation, the innermost roll (_e_),
in order that it may not be lost in the recess and the intermediate
(_d_), the smallest. Each roll has its own shaft and capital; and the
two smaller, which in effect upon the eye, owing to the retirement of
the innermost, are nearly equal, have smaller capitals than the two
larger, lifted a little to bring them to the same level. The wall in the
trefoiled lights is curved, as from _e_ to _f_ in the section; but in
the quatrefoil it is flat, only thrown back to the full depth of the
recess below so as to get a sharp shadow instead of a soft one, the
mouldings falling back to it in nearly a vertical curve behind the roll
_e_. This could not, however, be managed with the simpler mouldings of
the smaller quatrefoil above, whose half section is given from _g_ to
g_2; but the architect was evidently fretted by the heavy look of its
circular foils as opposed to the light spring of the arches below: so he
threw its cusps obliquely clear from the wall, as seen in fig. 2,
attached to it where they meet the circle, but with their finials pushed
out from the natural level (_h_, in the section) to that of the first
order (g_2) and supported by stone props behind, as seen in the
profile fig. 2, which I got from the correspondent panel on the buttress
face (fig. 1 being on its side), and of which the lower cusps, being
broken away, show the remnant of one of their props projecting from the
wall. The oblique curve thus obtained in the profile is of singular
grace. Take it all in all, I have never met with a more exquisite piece
of varied, yet severe, proportioned and general arrangement (though all
the windows of the period are fine, and especially delightful in the
subordinate proportioning of the smaller capitals to the smaller
shafts). The only fault it has is the inevitable misarrangement of the
central shafts; for the enlargement of the inner roll, though beautiful
in the group of four divisions at the side, causes, in the triple
central shaft, the very awkwardness of heavy lateral members which has
just been in most instances condemned. In the windows of the choir, and
in most of the period, this difficulty is avoided by making the fourth
order a fillet which only follows the foliation, while the three
outermost are nearly in arithmetical progression of size, and the
central triple shaft has of course the largest roll in front. The
moulding of the Palazzo Foscari (Plate VIII., and Plate IV. fig. 8) is,
for so simple a group, the grandest in effect I have even seen: it is
composed of a large roll with two subordinates.

XXVIII. It is of course impossible to enter into details of instances
belonging to so intricate division of our subject, in the compass of a
general essay. I can but rapidly name the chief conditions of right.
Another of these is the connection of Symmetry with horizontal, and of
Proportion with vertical, division. Evidently there is in symmetry a
sense not merely of equality, but of balance: now a thing cannot be
balanced by another on the top of it, though it may by one at the side
of it. Hence, while it is not only allowable, but often necessary, to
divide buildings, or parts of them, horizontally into halves, thirds, or
other equal parts, all vertical divisions of this kind are utterly
wrong; worst into half, next worst in the regular numbers which more
betray the equality. I should have thought this almost the first
principle of proportion which a young architect was taught: and yet I
remember an important building, recently erected in England, in which
the columns are cut in half by the projecting architraves of the central
windows; and it is quite usual to see the spires of modern Gothic
churches divided by a band of ornament half way up. In all fine spires
there are two bands and three parts, as at Salisbury. The ornamented
portion of the tower is there cut in half, and allowably, because the
spire forms the third mass to which the other two are subordinate: two
stories are also equal in Giotto's campanile, but dominant over smaller
divisions below, and subordinated to the noble third above. Even this
arrangement is difficult to treat; and it is usually safer to increase
or diminish the height of the divisions regularly as they rise, as in
the Doge's Palace, whose three divisions are in a bold geometrical
progression: or, in towers, to get an alternate proportion between the
body, the belfry, and the crown, as in the campanile of St. Mark's. But,
at all events, get rid of equality; leave that to children and their
card houses: the laws of nature and the reason of man are alike against
it, in arts, as in politics. There is but one thoroughly ugly tower in
Italy that I know of, and that is so because it is divided into vertical
equal parts: the tower of Pisa.[12]

XXIX. One more principle of Proportion I have to name, equally simple,
equally neglected. Proportion is between three terms at _least_. Hence,
as the pinnacles are not enough without the spire, so neither the spire
without the pinnacles. All men feel this and usually express their
feeling by saying that the pinnacles conceal the junction of the spire
and tower. This is one reason; but a more influential one is, that the
pinnacles furnish the third term to the spire and tower. So that it is
not enough, in order to secure proportion, to divide a building
unequally; it must be divided into at least three parts; it may be into
more (and in details with advantage), but on a large scale I find three
is about the best number of parts in elevation, and five in horizontal
extent, with freedom of increase to five in the one case and seven in
the other; but not to more without confusion (in architecture, that is
to say; for in organic structure the numbers cannot be limited). I
purpose, in the course of works which are in preparation, to give
copious illustrations of this subject, but I will take at present only
one instance of vertical proportion, from the flower stem of the common
water plantain, _Alisma Plantago_. Fig. 5, Plate XII. is a reduced
profile of one side of a plant gathered at random; it is seen to have
five masts, of which, however, the uppermost is a mere shoot, and we can
consider only their relations up to the fourth. Their lengths are
measured on the line A B, which is the actual length of the lowest mass
_a b_, A C=_b c_, A D=_c d_, and A E=_d e_. If the reader will take the
trouble to measure these lengths and compare them, he will find that,
within half a line, the uppermost A E=5/7 of A D, A D=6/8 of A C, and A
C=7/9 of A B; a most subtle diminishing proportion. From each of the
joints spring three major and three minor branches, each between each;
but the major branches, at any joint, are placed over the minor branches
at the joint below, by the curious arrangement of the joint itself--the
stem is bluntly triangular; fig. 6 shows the section of any joint. The
outer darkened triangle is the section of the lower stem; the inner,
left light, of the upper stem; and the three main branches spring from
the ledges left by the recession. Thus the stems diminish in diameter
just as they diminish in height. The main branches (falsely placed in
the profile over each other to show their relations) have respectively
seven, six, five, four, and three arm-bones, like the masts of the stem;
these divisions being proportioned in the same subtle manner. From the
joints of these, it seems to be the _plan_ of the plant that three
major and three minor branches should again spring, bearing the flowers:
but, in these infinitely complicated members, vegetative nature admits
much variety; in the plant from which these measures were taken the full
complement appeared only at one of the secondary joints.

The leaf of this plant has five ribs on each side, as its flower
generally five masts, arranged with the most exquisite grace of curve;
but of lateral proportion I shall rather take illustrations from
architecture: the reader will find several in the accounts of the Duomo
at Pisa and St. Mark's at Venice, in Chap. V. §§ XIV.-XVI. I give these
arrangements merely as illustrations, not as precedents: all beautiful
proportions are unique, they are not general formulæ.

XXX. The other condition of architectural treatment which we proposed to
notice was the abstraction of imitated form. But there is a peculiar
difficulty in touching within these narrow limits on such a subject as
this, because the abstraction of which we find examples in existing art,
is partly involuntary; and it is a matter of much nicety to determine
where it begins to be purposed. In the progress of national as well as
of individual mind, the first attempts at imitation are always abstract
and incomplete. Greater completion marks the progress of art, absolute
completion usually its decline; whence absolute completion of imitative
form is often supposed to be in itself wrong. But it is not wrong
always, only dangerous. Let us endeavor briefly to ascertain wherein its
danger consists, and wherein its dignity.

XXXI. I have said that all art is abstract in its beginnings; that is to
say, it expresses only a small number of the qualities of the thing
represented. Curved and complex lines are represented by straight and
simple ones; interior markings of forms are few, and much is symbolical
and conventional. There is a resemblance between the work of a great
nation, in this phase, and the work of childhood and ignorance, which,
in the mind of a careless observer, might attach something like ridicule
to it. The form of a tree on the Ninevite sculptures is much like that
which, come twenty years ago, was familiar upon samplers; and the types
of the face and figure in early Italian art are susceptible of easy
caricature. On the signs which separate the infancy of magnificent
manhood from every other, I do not pause to insist (they consist
entirely in the choice of the symbol and of the features abstracted);
but I pass to the next stage of art, a condition of strength in which
the abstraction which was begun in incapability is continued in free
will. This is the case, however, in pure sculpture and painting, as well
as in architecture; and we have nothing to do but with that greater
severity of manner which fits either to be associated with the more
realist art. I believe it properly consists only in a due expression of
their subordination, an expression varying according to their place and
office. The question is first to be clearly determined whether the
architecture is a frame for the sculpture, or the sculpture an ornament
of the architecture. If the latter, then the first office of that
sculpture is not to represent the things it imitates, but to gather out
of them those arrangements of form which shall be pleasing to the eye in
their intended places. So soon as agreeable lines and points of shade
have been added to the mouldings which were meagre, or to the lights
which were unrelieved, the architectural work of the imitation is
accomplished; and how far it shall be wrought towards completeness or
not, will depend upon its place, and upon other various circumstances.
If, in its particular use or position, it is symmetrically arranged,
there is, of course, an instant indication of architectural subjection.
But symmetry is not abstraction. Leaves may be carved in the most
regular order, and yet be meanly imitative; or, on the other hand, they
may be thrown wild and loose, and yet be highly architectural in their
separate treatment. Nothing can be less symmetrical than the group of
leaves which join the two columns in Plate XIII.; yet, since nothing of
the leaf character is given but what is necessary for the bare
suggestion of its image and the attainment of the lines desired, their
treatment is highly abstract. It shows that the workman only wanted so
much of the leaf as he supposed good for his architecture, and would
allow no more; and how much is to be supposed good, depends, as I have
said, much more on place and circumstance than on general laws. I know
that this is not usually thought, and that many good architects would
insist on abstraction in all cases: the question is so wide and so
difficult that I express my opinion upon it most diffidently; but my own
feeling is, that a purely abstract manner, like that of our earliest
English work, does not afford room for the perfection of beautiful form,
and that its severity is wearisome after the eye has been long
accustomed to it. I have not done justice to the Salisbury dog-tooth
moulding, of which the effect is sketched in fig. 5, Plate X., but I
have done more justice to it nevertheless than to the beautiful French
one above it; and I do not think that any candid reader would deny that,
piquant and spirited as is that from Salisbury, the Rouen moulding is,
in every respect, nobler. It will be observed that its symmetry is more
complicated, the leafage being divided into double groups of two lobes
each, each lobe of different structure. With exquisite feeling, one of
these double groups is alternately omitted on the other side of the
moulding (not seen in the Plate, but occupying the cavetto of the
section), thus giving a playful lightness to the whole; and if the
reader will allow for a beauty in the flow of the curved outlines
(especially on the angle), of which he cannot in the least judge from my
rude drawing, he will not, I think, expect easily to find a nobler
instance of decoration adapted to the severest mouldings.

Now it will be observed, that there is in its treatment a high degree of
abstraction, though not so conventional as that of Salisbury: that is to
say, the leaves have little more than their flow and outline
represented; they are hardly undercut, but their edges are connected by
a gentle and most studied curve with the stone behind; they have no
serrations, no veinings, no rib or stalk on the angle, only an incision
gracefully made towards their extremities, indicative of the central rib
and depression. The whole style of the abstraction shows that the
architect could, if he had chosen, have carried the imitation much
farther, but stayed at this point of his own free will; and what he has
done is also so perfect in its kind, that I feel disposed to accept his
authority without question, so far as I can gather it from his works, on
the whole subject of abstraction.

XXXII. Happily his opinion is frankly expressed. This moulding is on the
lateral buttress, and on a level with the top of the north gate; it
cannot therefore be closely seen except from the wooden stairs of the
belfry; it is not intended to be so seen, but calculated for a distance
of, at least, forty to fifty feet from the eye. In the vault of the gate
itself, half as near again, there are three rows of mouldings, as I
think, by the same designer, at all events part of the same plan. One of
them is given in Plate I. fig. 2 _a_. It will be seen that the
abstraction is here infinitely less; the ivy leaves have stalks and
associated fruit, and a rib for each lobe, and are so far undercut as to
detach their forms from the stone; while in the vine-leaf moulding
above, of the same period, from the south gate, serration appears added
to other purely imitative characters. Finally, in the animals which form
the ornaments of the portion of the gate which is close to the eye,
abstraction nearly vanishes into perfect sculpture.

XXXIII. Nearness to the eye, however, is not the only circumstance which
influences architectural abstraction. These very animals are not merely
better cut because close to the eye; they are put close to the eye that
they may, without indiscretion, be better cut, on the noble principle,
first I think, clearly enunciated by Mr. Eastlake, that the closest
imitation shall be of the noblest object. Farther, since the wildness
and manner of growth of vegetation render a bona fide imitation of it
impossible in sculpture--since its members must be reduced in number,
ordered in direction, and cut away from their roots, even under the most
earnestly imitative treatment,--it becomes a point, as I think, of good
judgment, to proportion the completeness of execution of parts to the
formality of the whole; and since five or six leaves must stand for a
tree, to let also five or six touches stand for a leaf. But since the
animal generally admits of perfect outline--since its form is detached,
and may be fully represented, its sculpture may be more complete and
faithful in all its parts. And this principle will be actually found. I
believe, to guide the old workmen. If the animal form be in a gargoyle,
incomplete, and coining out of a block of stone, or if a head only, as
for a boss or other such partial use, its sculpture will be highly
abstract. But if it be an entire animal, as a lizard, or a bird, or a
squirrel, peeping among leafage, its sculpture will be much farther
carried, and I think, if small, near the eye, and worked in a fine
material, may rightly be carried to the utmost possible completion.
Surely we cannot wish a less finish bestowed on those which animate the
mouldings of the south door of the cathedral of Florence; nor desire
that the birds in the capitals of the Doge's palace should be stripped
of a single plume.

XXXIV. Under these limitations, then, I think that perfect sculpture may
be made a part of the severest architecture; but this perfection was
said in the outset to be dangerous. It is so in the highest degree; for
the moment the architect allows himself to dwell on the imitated
portions, there is a chance of his losing sight of the duty of his
ornament, of its business as a part of the composition, and sacrificing
its points of shade and effect to the delight of delicate carving. And
then he is lost. His architecture has become a mere framework for the
setting of delicate sculpture, which had better be all taken down and
put into cabinets. It is well, therefore, that the young architect
should be taught to think of imitative ornament as of the extreme of
grace in language; not to be regarded at first, not to be obtained at
the cost of purpose, meaning, force, or conciseness, yet, indeed, a
perfection--the least of all perfections, and yet the crowning one of
all--one which by itself, and regarded in itself, is an architectural
coxcombry, but is yet the sign of the most highly-trained mind and power
when it is associated with others. It is a safe manner, as I think, to
design all things at first in severe abstraction, and to be prepared, if
need were, to carry them out in that form; then to mark the parts where
high finish would be admissible, to complete these always with stern
reference to their general effect, and then connect them by a graduated
scale of abstraction with the rest. And there is one safeguard against
danger in this process on which I would finally insist. Never imitate
anything but natural forms, and those the noblest, in the completed
parts. The degradation of the cinque cento manner of decoration was
not owing to its naturalism, to its faithfulness of imitation, but to
its imitation of ugly, i.e. unnatural things. So long as it restrained
itself to sculpture of animals and flowers, it remained noble. The
balcony, on the opposite page, from a house in the Campo St. Benedetto
at Venice, shows one of the earliest occurrences of the cinque cento
arabesque, and a fragment of the pattern is given in Plate XII. fig. 8.
It is but the arresting upon the stone work of a stem or two of the
living flowers, which are rarely wanting in the window above (and which,
by the by, the French and Italian peasantry often trellis with exquisite
taste about their casements). This arabesque, relieved as it is in
darkness from the white stone by the stain of time, is surely both
beautiful and pure; and as long as the renaissance ornament remained in
such forms it may be beheld with undeserved admiration. But the moment
that unnatural objects were associated with these, and armor, and
musical instruments, and wild meaningless scrolls and curled shields,
and other such fancies, became principal in its subjects, its doom was
sealed, and with it that of the architecture of the world.

XXXV. III. Our final inquiry was to be into the use of color as
associated with architectural ornament.

I do not feel able to speak with any confidence respecting the touching
of _sculpture_ with color. I would only note one point, that sculpture
is the representation of an idea, while architecture is itself a real
thing. The idea may, as I think, be left colorless, and colored by the
beholder's mind: but a reality ought to have reality in all its
attributes: its color should be as fixed as its form. I cannot,
therefore, consider architecture as in any wise perfect without color.
Farther, as I have above noticed, I think the colors of architecture
should be those of natural stones; partly because more durable, but also
because more perfect and graceful. For to conquer the harshness and
deadness of tones laid upon stone or on gesso, needs the management and
discretion of a true painter; and on this co-operation we must not
calculate in laying down rules for general practice. If Tintoret or
Giorgione are at hand, and ask us for a wall to paint, we will alter our
whole design for their sake, and become their servants; but we must, as
architects, expect the aid of the common workman only; and the laying of
color by a mechanical hand, and its toning under a vulgar eye, are far
more offensive than rudeness in cutting the stone. The latter is
imperfection only; the former deadness or discordance. At the best, such
color is so inferior to the lovely and mellow hues of the natural stone,
that it is wise to sacrifice some of the intricacy of design, if by so
doing we may employ the nobler material. And if, as we looked to Nature
for instruction respecting form, we look to her also to learn the
management of color, we shall, perhaps, find that this sacrifice of
intricacy is for other causes expedient.

XXXVI. First, then, I think that in making this reference we are to
consider our building as a kind of organized creature; in coloring which
we must look to the single and separately organized creatures of Nature,
not to her landscape combinations. Our building, if it is well composed,
is one thing, and is to be colored as Nature would color one thing--a
shell, a flower, or an animal; not as she colors groups of things.

And the first broad conclusion we shall deduce from observance of
natural color in such cases will be, that it never follows form, but is
arranged on an entirely separate system. What mysterious connection
there may be between the shape of the spots on an animal's skin and its
anatomical system, I do not know, nor even if such a connection has in
any wise been traced: but to the eye the systems are entirely separate,
and in many cases that of color is accidentally variable. The stripes of
a zebra do not follow the lines of its body or limbs, still less the
spots of a leopard. In the plumage of birds, each feather bears a part
of the pattern which is arbitrarily carried over the body, having indeed
certain graceful harmonies with the form, diminishing or enlarging in
directions which sometimes follow, but also not unfrequently oppose, the
directions of its muscular lines. Whatever harmonies there may be, are
distinctly like those of two separate musical parts, coinciding here and
there only--never discordant, but essentially different I hold this,
then, for the first great principle of architectural color. Let it be
visibly independent of form. Never paint a column with vertical lines,
but always cross it.[13] Never give separate mouldings separate colors
(I know this is heresy, but I never shrink from any conclusions, however
contrary to human authority, to which I am led by observance of natural
principles); and in sculptured ornaments I do not paint the leaves or
figures (I cannot help the Elgin frieze) of one color and their ground
of another, but vary both the ground and the figures with the same
harmony. Notice how Nature does it in a variegated flower; not one leaf
red and another white, but a point of red and a zone of white, or
whatever it may be, to each. In certain places you may run your two
systems closer, and here and there let them be parallel for a note or
two, but see that the colors and the forms coincide only as two orders
of mouldings do; the same for an instant, but each holding its own
course. So single members may sometimes have single colors: as a bird's
head is sometimes of one color and its shoulders another, you may make
your capital of one color and your shaft another; but in general the
best place for color is on broad surfaces, not on the points of interest
in form. An animal is mottled on its breast and back, rarely on its paws
or about its eyes; so put your variegation boldly on the flat wall and
broad shaft, but be shy of it in the capital and moulding; in all cases
it is a safe rule to simplify color when form is rich, and vice versâ;
and I think it would be well in general to carve all capitals and
graceful ornaments in white marble, and so leave them.

XXXVII. Independence then being first secured, what kind of limiting
outlines shall we adopt for the system of color itself?

I am quite sure that any person familiar with natural objects will never
be surprised at any appearance of care or finish in them. That is the
condition of the universe. But there is cause both for surprise and
inquiry whenever we see anything like carelessness or incompletion: that
is not a common condition; it must be one appointed for some singular
purpose. I believe that such surprise will be forcibly felt by any one
who, after studying carefully the lines of some variegated organic
form, will set himself to copy with similar diligence those of its
colors. The boundaries of the forms he will assuredly, whatever the
object, have found drawn with a delicacy and precision which no human
hand can follow. Those of its colors he will find in many cases, though
governed always by a certain rude symmetry, yet irregular, blotched,
imperfect, liable to all kinds of accidents and awkwardnesses. Look at
the tracery of the lines on a camp shell, and see how oddly and
awkwardly its tents are pitched. It is not indeed always so: there is
occasionally, as in the eye of the peacock's plume, an apparent
precision, but still a precision far inferior to that of the drawing of
the filaments which bear that lovely stain; and in the plurality of
cases a degree of looseness and variation, and, still more singularly,
of harshness and violence in arrangement, is admitted in color which
would be monstrous in form. Observe the difference in the precision of a
fish's scales and of the spots on them.

XXXVIII. Now, why it should be that color is best seen under these
circumstances I will not here endeavor to determine; nor whether the
lesson we are to learn from it be that it is God's will that all manner
of delights should never be combined in one thing. But the fact is
certain, that color is always by Him arranged in these simple or rude
forms, and as certain that, therefore, it must be best seen in them, and
that we shall never mend by refining its arrangements. Experience
teaches us the same thing. Infinite nonsense has been written about the
union of perfect color with perfect form. They never will, never can be
united. Color, to be perfect, _must_ have a soft outline or a simple
one: it cannot have a refined one; and you will never produce a good
painted window with good figure-drawing in it. You will lose perfection
of color as you give perfection of line. Try to put in order and form
the colors of a piece of opal.

XXXIX. I conclude, then, that all arrangements of color, for its own
sake, in graceful forms, are barbarous; and that, to paint a color
pattern with the lovely lines of a Greek leaf moulding, is an utterly
savage procedure. I cannot find anything in natural color like this: it
is not in the bond. I find it in all natural form--never in natural
color. If, then, our architectural color is to be beautiful as its form
was, by being imitative, we are limited to these conditions--to simple
masses of it, to zones, as in the rainbow and the zebra; cloudings and
flamings, as in marble shells and plumage, or spots of various shapes
and dimensions. All these conditions are susceptible of various degrees
of sharpness and delicacy, and of complication in arrangement. The zone
may become a delicate line, and arrange itself in chequers and zig-zags.
The flaming may be more or less defined, as on a tulip leaf, and may at
last be represented by a triangle of color, and arrange itself in stars
or other shapes; the spot may be also graduated into a stain, or defined
into a square or circle. The most exquisite harmonies may be composed of
these simple elements: some soft and full of flushed and melting spaces
of color; others piquant and sparkling, or deep and rich, formed of
close groups of the fiery fragments: perfect and lovely proportion may
be exhibited in the relation of their quantities, infinite invention in
their disposition: but, in all cases, their shape will be effective only
as it determines their quantity, and regulates their operation on each
other; points or edges of one being introduced between breadths of
others, and so on. Triangular and barred forms are therefore convenient,
or others the simplest possible; leaving the pleasure of the spectator
to be taken in the color, and in that only. Curved outlines, especially
if refined, deaden the color, and confuse the mind. Even in figure
painting the greatest colorists have either melted their outline away,
as often Correggio and Rubens; or purposely made their masses of
ungainly shape, as Titian; or placed their brightest hues in costume,
where they could get quaint patterns, as Veronese, and especially
Angelico, with whom, however, the absolute virtue of color is secondary
to grace of line. Hence, he never uses the blended hues of Correggio,
like those on the wing of the little Cupid, in the "Venus and Mercury,"
but always the severest type--the peacock plume. Any of these men would
have looked with infinite disgust upon the leafage and scrollwork which
form the ground of color in our modern painted windows, and yet all
whom I have named were much infected with the love of renaissance
designs. We must also allow for the freedom of the painter's subject,
and looseness of his associated lines; a pattern being severe in a
picture, which is over luxurious upon a building. I believe, therefore,
that it is impossible to be over quaint or angular in architectural
coloring; and thus many dispositions which I have had occasion to
reprobate in form, are, in color, the best that can be invented. I have
always, for instance, spoken with contempt of the Tudor style, for this
reason, that, having surrendered all pretence to spaciousness and
breadth,--having divided its surfaces by an infinite number of lines, it
yet sacrifices the only characters which can make lines beautiful;
sacrifices all the variety and grace which long atoned for the caprice
of the Flamboyant, and adopts, for its leading feature, an entanglement
of cross bars and verticals, showing about as much invention or skill of
design as the reticulation of the bricklayer's sieve. Yet this very
reticulation would in color be highly beautiful; and all the heraldry,
and other features which, in form, are monstrous, may be delightful as
themes of color (so long as there are no fluttering or over-twisted
lines in them); and this observe, because, when colored, they take the
place of a mere pattern, and the resemblance to nature, which could not
be found in their sculptured forms, is found in their piquant
variegation of other surfaces. There is a beautiful and bright bit of
wall painting behind the Duomo of Verona, composed of coats of arms,
whose bearings are balls of gold set in bars of green (altered blue?)
and white, with cardinal's hats in alternate squares. This is of course,
however, fit only for domestic work. The front of the Doge's palace at
Venice is the purest and most chaste model that I can name (but one) of
the fit application of color to public buildings. The sculpture and
mouldings are all white; but the wall surface is chequered with marble
blocks of pale rose, the chequers being in no wise harmonized, or fitted
to the forms of the windows; but looking as if the surface had been
completed first, and the windows cut out of it. In Plate XII. fig. 2 the
reader will see two of the patterns used in green and white, on the
columns of San Michele of Lucca, every column having a different design.
Both are beautiful, but the upper one certainly the best. Yet in
sculpture its lines would have been perfectly barbarous, and those even
of the lower not enough refined.

XL. Restraining ourselves, therefore, to the use of such simple
patterns, so far forth as our color is subordinate either to
architectural structure, or sculptural form, we have yet one more manner
of ornamentation to add to our general means of effect, monochrome
design, the intermediate condition between coloring and carving. The
relations of the entire system of architectural decoration may then be
thus expressed.

     1. Organic form dominant. True, independent sculpture, and
     alto-relievo; rich capitals, and mouldings; to be elaborate in
     completion of form, not abstract, and either to be left in pure
     white marble, or most cautiously touched with color in points and
     borders only, in a system not concurrent with their forms.

     2. Organic form sub-dominant. Basso-relievo or intaglio. To be more
     abstract in proportion to the reduction of depth; to be also more
     rigid and simple in contour; to be touched with color more boldly
     and in an increased degree, exactly in proportion to the reduced
     depth and fulness of form, but still in a system non-concurrent
     with their forms.

     3. Organic form abstracted to outline. Monochrome design, still
     farther reduced to simplicity of contour, and therefore admitting
     for the first time the color to be concurrent with its outlines;
     that is to say, as its name imports, the entire figure to be
     detached in one color from a ground of another.

     4. Organic forms entirely lost. Geometrical patterns or variable
     cloudings in the most vivid color.

On the opposite side of this scale, ascending from the color pattern, I
would place the various forms of painting which may be associated with
architecture: primarily, and as most fit for such purpose, the mosaic,
highly abstract in treatment, and introducing brilliant color in masses;
the Madonna of Torcello being, as I think, the noblest type of the
manner, and the Baptistery of Parma the richest: next, the purely
decorative fresco, like that of the Arena Chapel; finally, the fresco
becoming principal, as in the Vatican and Sistine. But I cannot, with
any safety, follow the principles of abstraction in this pictorial
ornament; since the noblest examples of it appear to me to owe their
architectural applicability to their archaic manner; and I think that
the abstraction and admirable simplicity which render them fit media of
the most splendid coloring, cannot be recovered by a voluntary
condescension. The Byzantines themselves would not, I think, if they
could have drawn the figure better, have used it for a color decoration;
and that use, as peculiar to a condition of childhood, however noble and
full of promise, cannot be included among those modes of adornment which
are now legitimate or even possible. There is a difficulty in the
management of the painted window for the same reason, which has not yet
been met, and we must conquer that first, before we can venture to
consider the wall as a painted window on a large scale. Pictorial
subject, without such abstraction, becomes necessarily principal, or, at
all events, ceases to be the architect's concern; its plan must be left
to the painter after the completion of the building, as in the works of
Veronese and Giorgione on the palaces of Venice.

XLI. Pure architectural decoration, then, may be considered as limited
to the four kinds above specified; of which each glides almost
imperceptibly into the other. Thus, the Elgin frieze is a monochrome in
a state of transition to sculpture, retaining, as I think, the half-cast
skin too long. Of pure monochrome, I have given an example in Plate VI.,
from the noble front of St. Michele of Lucca. It contains forty such
arches, all covered with equally elaborate ornaments, entirely drawn by
cutting out their ground to about the depth of an inch in the flat white
marble, and filling the spaces with pieces of green serpentine; a most
elaborate mode of sculpture, requiring excessive care and precision in
the fitting of the edges, and of course double work, the same line
needing to be cut both in the marble and serpentine. The excessive
simplicity of the forms will be at once perceived; the eyes of the
figures of animals, for instance, being indicated only by a round dot,
formed by a little inlet circle of serpentine, about half an inch over:
but, though simple, they admit often much grace of curvature, as in the
neck of the bird seen above the right hand pillar.[14] The pieces of
serpentine have fallen out in many places, giving the black shadows, as
seen under the horseman's arm and bird's neck, and in the semi-circular
line round the arch, once filled with some pattern. It would have
illustrated my point better to have restored the lost portions, but I
always draw a thing exactly as it is, hating restoration of any kind;
and I would especially direct the reader's attention to the completion
of the forms in the _sculptured_ ornament of the marble cornices, as
opposed to the abstraction of the monochrome figures, of the ball and
cross patterns between the arches, and of the triangular ornament round
the arch on the left.

XLII. I have an intense love for these monochrome figures, owing to
their wonderful life and spirit in all the works on which I found them;
nevertheless, I believe that the excessive degree of abstraction which
they imply necessitates our placing them in the rank of a progressive or
imperfect art, and that a perfect building should rather be composed of
the highest sculpture (organic form dominant and sub-dominant),
associated with pattern colors on the flat or broad surfaces. And we
find, in fact, that the cathedral of Pisa, which is a higher type than
that of Lucca, exactly follows this condition, the color being put in
geometrical patterns on its surfaces, and animal-forms and lovely
leafage used in the sculptured cornices and pillars. And I think that
the grace of the carved forms is best seen when it is thus boldly
opposed to severe traceries of color, while the color itself is, as we
have seen, always most piquant when it is put into sharp angular
arrangements. Thus the sculpture is approved and set off by the color,
and the color seen to the best advantage in its opposition both to the
whiteness and the grace of the carved marble.

XLIII. In the course of this and the preceding chapters, I have now
separately enumerated most of the conditions of Power and Beauty, which
in the outset I stated to be the grounds of the deepest impressions with
which architecture could affect the human mind; but I would ask
permission to recapitulate them in order to see if there be any building
which I may offer as an example of the unison, in such manner as is
possible, of them all. Glancing back, then, to the beginning of the
third chapter, and introducing in their place the conditions
incidentally determined in the two previous sections, we shall have the
following list of noble characters:

Considerable size, exhibited by simple terminal lines (Chap. III. § 6).
Projection towards the top (§ 7). Breadth of flat surface (§ 8). Square
compartments of that surface (§ 9). Varied and visible masonry (§ 11).
Vigorous depth of shadow (§ 13), exhibited especially by pierced
traceries (§ 18). Varied proportion in ascent (Chap. IV. § 28). Lateral
symmetry (§ 28). Sculpture most delicate at the base (Chap. I. § 12).
Enriched quantity of ornament at the top (§ 13). Sculpture abstract in
inferior ornaments and mouldings (Chap. IV. § 31), complete in animal
forms (§ 33). Both to be executed in white marble (§ 40). Vivid color
introduced in flat geometrical patterns (§ 39), and obtained by the use
of naturally colored stone (§ 35).

These characteristics occur more or less in different buildings, some in
one and some in another. But all together, and all in their highest
possible relative degrees, they exist, as far as I know, only in one
building in the world, the Campanile of Giotto at Florence. The drawing
of the tracery of its upper story, which heads this chapter, rude as it
is, will nevertheless give the reader some better conception of that
tower's magnificence than the thin outlines in which it is usually
portrayed. In its first appeal to the stranger's eye there is something
unpleasing; a mingling, as it seems to him, of over severity with over
minuteness. But let him give it time, as he should to all other
consummate art. I remember well how, when a boy, I used to despise that
Campanile, and think it meanly smooth and finished. But I have since
lived beside it many a day, and looked out upon it from my windows by
sunlight and moonlight, and I shall not soon forget how profound and
gloomy appeared to me the savageness of the Northern Gothic, when I
afterwards stood, for the first time, beneath the front of Salisbury.
The contrast is indeed strange, if it could be quickly felt, between the
rising of those grey walls out of their quiet swarded space, like dark
and barren rocks out of a green lake, with their rude, mouldering,
rough-grained shafts, and triple lights, without tracery or other
ornament than the martins' nests in the height of them, and that bright,
smooth, sunny surface of glowing jasper, those spiral shafts and fairy
traceries, so white, so faint, so crystalline, that their slight shapes
are hardly traced in darkness on the pallor of the Eastern sky, that
serene height of mountain alabaster, colored like a morning cloud, and
chased like a sea shell. And if this be, as I believe it, the model and
mirror of perfect architecture, is there not something to be learned by
looking back to the early life of him who raised it? I said that the
Power of human mind had its growth in the Wilderness; much more must the
love and the conception of that beauty, whose every line and hue we have
seen to be, at the best, a faded image of God's daily work, and an
arrested ray of some star of creation, be given chiefly in the places
which He has gladdened by planting there the fir tree and the pine. Not
within the walls of Florence, but among the far away fields of her
lilies, was the child trained who was to raise that headstone of Beauty
above the towers of watch and war. Remember all that he became; count
the sacred thoughts with which he filled the heart of Italy; ask those
who followed him what they learned at his feet; and when you have
numbered his labors, and received their testimony, if it seem to you
that God had verily poured out upon this His servant no common nor
restrained portion of His Spirit, and that he was indeed a king among
the children of men, remember also that the legend upon his crown was
that of David's:--"I took thee from the sheepcote, and from following
the sheep."




CHAPTER V.

THE LAMP OF LIFE.


I. Among the countless analogies by which the nature and relations of
the human soul are illustrated in the material creation, none are more
striking than the impressions inseparably connected with the active and
dormant states of matter. I have elsewhere endeavored to show, that no
inconsiderable part of the essential characters of Beauty depended on
the expression of vital energy in organic things, or on the subjection
to such energy, of things naturally passive and powerless. I need not
here repeat, of what was then advanced, more than the statement which I
believe will meet with general acceptance, that things in other respects
alike, as in their substance, or uses, or outward forms, are noble or
ignoble in proportion to the fulness of the life which either they
themselves enjoy, or of whose action they bear the evidence, as sea
sands are made beautiful by their bearing the seal of the motion of the
waters. And this is especially true of all objects which bear upon them
the impress of the highest order of creative life, that is to say, of
the mind of man: they become noble or ignoble in proportion to the
amount of the energy of that mind which has visibly been employed upon
them. But most peculiarly and imperatively does the rule hold with
respect to the creations of Architecture, which being properly capable
of no other life than this, and being not essentially composed of things
pleasant in themselves,--as music of sweet sounds, or painting of fair
colors, but of inert substance,--depend, for their dignity and
pleasurableness in the utmost degree, upon the vivid expression of the
intellectual life which has been concerned in their production.

II. Now in all other kind of energies except that of man's mind, there
is no question as to what is life, and what is not. Vital sensibility,
whether vegetable or animal, may, indeed, be reduced to so great
feebleness, as to render its existence a matter of question, but when it
is evident at all, it is evident as such: there is no mistaking any
imitation or pretence of it for the life itself; no mechanism nor
galvanism can take its place; nor is any resemblance of it so striking
as to involve even hesitation in the judgment; although many occur which
the human imagination takes pleasure in exalting, without for an instant
losing sight of the real nature of the dead things it animates; but
rejoicing rather in its own excessive life, which puts gesture into
clouds, and joy into waves, and voices into rocks.

III. But when we begin to be concerned with the energies of man, we find
ourselves instantly dealing with a double creature. Most part of his
being seems to have a fictitious counterpart, which it is at his peril
if he do not cast off and deny. Thus he has a true and false (otherwise
called a living and dead, or a feigned or unfeigned) faith. He has a
true and a false hope, a true and a false charity, and, finally, a true
and a false life. His true life is like that of lower organic beings,
the independent force by which he moulds and governs external things; it
is a force of assimilation which converts everything around him into
food, or into instruments; and which, however humbly or obediently it
may listen to or follow the guidance of superior intelligence, never
forfeits its own authority as a judging principle, as a will capable
either of obeying or rebelling. His false life is, indeed, but one of
the conditions of death or stupor, but it acts, even when it cannot be
said to animate, and is not always easily known from the true. It is
