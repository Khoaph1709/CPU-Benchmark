NOTES.

(A) [See p. 80].


One of the favourite objections, brought against the Science of Logic by
its detractors, is that a Syllogism has no real validity as an argument,
since it involves the Fallacy of _Petitio Principii_ (i.e. "Begging the
Question", the essence of which is that the whole Conclusion is involved
in _one_ of the Premisses).

This formidable objection is refuted, with beautiful clearness and
simplicity, by these three Diagrams, which show us that, in each of the
three Figures, the Conclusion is really involved in the _two_ Premisses
taken together, each contributing its share.

Thus, in Fig. I., the Premiss xm_{0} empties the _Inner_ Cell of the
N.W. Quarter, while the Premiss ym_{0} empties its _Outer_ Cell. Hence
it needs the _two_ Premisses to empty the _whole_ of the N.W. Quarter,
and thus to prove the Conclusion xy_{0}.

Again, in Fig. II., the Premiss xm_{0} empties the Inner Cell of the
N.W. Quarter. The Premiss ym_{1} merely tells us that the Inner Portion
of the W. Half is _occupied_, so that we may place a 'I' in it,
_somewhere_; but, if this were the _whole_ of our information, we should
not know in _which_ Cell to place it, so that it would have to 'sit on
the fence': it is only when we learn, from the other Premiss, that the
_upper_ of these two Cells is _empty_, that we feel authorised to place
the 'I' in the _lower_ Cell, and thus to prove the Conclusion x'y_{1}.

Lastly, in Fig. III., the information, that m _exists_, merely
authorises us to place a 'I' _somewhere_ in the Inner Square----but it
has large choice of fences to sit upon! It needs the Premiss xm_{0} to
drive it out of the N. Half of that Square; and it needs the Premiss
ym_{0} to drive it out of the W. Half. Hence it needs the _two_
Premisses to drive it into the Inner Portion of the S.E. Quarter, and
thus to prove the Conclusion x'y'_{1}.

                                                                   pg165


APPENDIX,

ADDRESSED TO TEACHERS.


§ 1.

_Introductory._


There are several matters, too hard to discuss with _Learners_, which
nevertheless need to be explained to any _Teachers_, into whose hands
this book may fall, in order that they may thoroughly understand what my
Symbolic Method _is_, and in what respects it differs from the many
other Methods already published.

These matters are as follows:--

    The "Existential Import" of Propositions.
    The use of "is-not" (or "are-not") as a Copula.
    The theory "two Negative Premisses prove nothing."
    Euler's Method of Diagrams.
    Venn's Method of Diagrams.
    My Method of Diagrams.
    The Solution of a Syllogism by various Methods.
    My Method of treating Syllogisms and Sorites.
    Some account of Parts II, III.


§ 2.

_The "Existential Import" of Propositions._


The writers, and editors, of the Logical text-books which run in the
ordinary grooves----to whom I shall hereafter refer by the (I hope
inoffensive) title "The Logicians"----take, on this subject, what seems
to me to be a more humble position than is at all necessary. They speak
of the Copula of a Proposition "with bated breath", almost as if it were
a living, conscious Entity, capable of declaring for itself what it
chose to mean, and that we, poor human creatures, had nothing to do but
to ascertain _what_ was its sovereign will and pleasure, and submit to
it.
                                                                   pg166
In opposition to this view, I maintain that any writer of a book is
fully authorised in attaching any meaning he likes to any word or phrase
he intends to use. If I find an author saying, at the beginning of his
book, "Let it be understood that by the word '_black_' I shall always
mean '_white_', and that by the word '_white_' I shall always mean
'_black_'," I meekly accept his ruling, however injudicious I may think
it.

And so, with regard to the question whether a Proposition is or is not
to be understood as asserting the existence of its Subject, I maintain
that every writer may adopt his own rule, provided of course that it is
consistent with itself and with the accepted facts of Logic.

Let us consider certain views that may _logically_ be held, and thus
settle which of them may _conveniently_ be held; after which I shall
hold myself free to declare which of them _I_ intend to hold.

The _kinds_ of Propositions, to be considered, are those that begin with
"some", with "no", and with "all". These are usually called Propositions
"in _I_", "in _E_", and "in _A_".

First, then, a Proposition in _I_ may be understood as asserting, or
else as _not_ asserting, the existence of its Subject. (By "existence" I
mean of course whatever kind of existence suits its nature. The two
Propositions, "_dreams_ exist" and "_drums_ exist", denote two totally
different kinds of "existence". A _dream_ is an aggregate of ideas, and
exists only in the _mind of a dreamer_: whereas a _drum_ is an aggregate
of wood and parchment, and exists in _the hands of a drummer_.)

First, let us suppose that _I_ "asserts" (i.e. "asserts the existence of
its Subject").

Here, of course, we must regard a Proposition in _A_ as making the
_same_ assertion, since it necessarily _contains_ a Proposition in _I_.

We now have _I_ and _A_ "asserting". Does this leave us free to make
what supposition we choose as to _E_? My answer is "No. We are tied down
to the supposition that _E_ does _not_ assert." This can be proved as
follows:--

If possible, let _E_ "assert". Then (taking x, y, and z to represent
Attributes) we see that, if the Proposition "No xy are z" be true, some
things exist with the Attributes x and y: i.e. "Some x are y."
                                                                   pg167
Also we know that, if the Proposition "Some xy are z" be true, the same
result follows.

But these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of
them _must_ be true. Hence this result is _always_ true: i.e. the
Proposition "Some x are y" is _always_ true!

_Quod est absurdum._ (See Note (A), p. 195).

We see, then, that the supposition "_I_ asserts" necessarily leads to
"_A_ asserts, but _E_ does not". And this is the _first_ of the various
views that may conceivably be held.

Next, let us suppose that _I_ does _not_ "assert." And, along with this,
let us take the supposition that _E_ _does_ "assert."

Hence the Proposition "No x are y" means "Some x exist, and none of them
are y": i.e. "_all_ of them are _not_-y," which is a Proposition in _A_.
We also know, of course, that the Proposition "All x are not-y" proves
"No x are y." Now two Propositions, each of which proves the other, are
_equivalent_. Hence every Proposition in _A_ is equivalent to one in
_E_, and therefore "_asserts_".

Hence our _second_ conceivable view is "_E_ and _A_ assert, but _I_ does
not."

This view does not seen to involve any necessary contradiction with
itself or with the accepted facts of Logic. But, when we come to _test_
it, as applied to the actual _facts_ of life, we shall find I think,
that it fits in with them so badly that its adoption would be, to say
the least of it, singularly inconvenient for ordinary folk.

Let me record a little dialogue I have just held with my friend Jones,
who is trying to form a new Club, to be regulated on strictly _Logical_
principles.

_Author._ "Well, Jones! Have you got your new Club started yet?"

_Jones_ (_rubbing his hands_). "You'll be glad to hear that some of the
Members (mind, I only say '_some_') are millionaires! Rolling in gold,
my boy!"

_Author._ "That sounds well. And how many Members have entered?"

_Jones_ (_staring_). "None at all. We haven't got it started yet. What
makes you think we have?"

_Author._ "Why, I thought you said that some of the Members----"
                                                                   pg168
_Jones_ (_contemptuously_). "You don't seem to be aware that we're
working on strictly _Logical_ principles. A _Particular_ Proposition
does _not_ assert the existence of its Subject. I merely meant to say
that we've made a Rule not to admit _any_ Members till we have at least
_three_ Candidates whose incomes are over ten thousand a year!"

_Author._ "Oh, _that's_ what you meant, is it? Let's hear some more of
your Rules."

_Jones._ "Another is, that no one, who has been convicted seven times of
forgery, is admissible."

_Author._ "And here, again, I suppose you don't mean to assert there
_are_ any such convicts in existence?"

_Jones._ "Why, that's exactly what I _do_ mean to assert! Don't you know
that a Universal Negative _asserts_ the existence of its Subject? _Of
course_ we didn't make that Rule till we had satisfied ourselves that
there are several such convicts now living."

The Reader can now decide for himself how far this _second_ conceivable
view would fit in with the facts of life. He will, I think, agree with
me that Jones' view, of the 'Existential Import' of Propositions, would
lead to some inconvenience.

Thirdly, let us suppose that neither _I_ nor _E_ "asserts".

Now the supposition that the two Propositions, "Some x are y" and "No x
are not-y", do _not_ "assert", necessarily involves the supposition that
"All x are y" does _not_ "assert", since it would be absurd to suppose
that they assert, when combined, more than they do when taken
separately.

Hence the _third_ (and last) of the conceivable views is that neither
_I_, nor _E_, nor _A_, "asserts".

The advocates of this third view would interpret the Proposition "Some x
are y" to mean "If there _were_ any x in existence, some of them _would_
be y"; and so with _E_ and _A_.

It admits of proof that this view, as regards _A_, conflicts with the
accepted facts of Logic.

Let us take the Syllogism _Darapti_, which is universally accepted as
valid. Its form is

    "All m are x;
     All m are y.
         .'. Some y are x".
                                                                   pg169
This they would interpret as follows:--

    "If there were any m in existence, all of them would be x;
     If there were any m in existence, all of them would be y.
         .'. If there were any y in existence, some of them
               would be x".

That this Conclusion does _not_ follow has been so briefly and clearly
explained by Mr. Keynes (in his "Formal Logic", dated 1894, pp. 356,
357), that I prefer to quote his words:--

"_Let no proposition imply the existence either of its subject or of its
predicate._

"Take, as an example, a syllogism in _Darapti_:--

    '_All M is P_,
     _All M is S_,
          _.'. Some S is P_.'

"Taking S, M, P, as the minor, middle, and major terms respectively, the
conclusion will imply that, if there is an S, there is some P. Will the
premisses also imply this? If so, then the syllogism is valid; but not
otherwise.

"The conclusion implies that if S exists P exists; but, consistently
with the premisses, S may be existent while M and P are both
non-existent. An implication is, therefore, contained in the conclusion,
which is not justified by the premisses."

This seems to _me_ entirely clear and convincing. Still, "to make
sicker", I may as well throw the above (_soi-disant_) Syllogism into a
concrete form, which will be within the grasp of even a _non_-logical
Reader.

Let us suppose that a Boys' School has been set up, with the following
system of Rules:--

"All boys in the First (the highest) Class are to do French, Greek, and
Latin. All in the Second Class are to do Greek only. All in the Third
Class are to do Latin only."

Suppose also that there _are_ boys in the Third Class, and in the
Second; but that no boy has yet risen into the First.

It is evident that there are no boys in the School doing French: still
we know, by the Rules, what would happen if there _were_ any.
                                                                   pg170
We are authorised, then, by the _Data_, to assert the following two
Propositions:--

    "If there were any boys doing French, all of them would
       be doing Greek;
     If there were any boys doing French, all of them would
       be doing Latin."

And the Conclusion, according to "The Logicians" would be

    "If there were any boys doing Latin, some of them would
       be doing Greek."

Here, then, we have two _true_ Premisses and a _false_ Conclusion (since
we know that there _are_ boys doing Latin, and that _none_ of them are
doing Greek). Hence the argument is _invalid_.

Similarly it may be shown that this "non-existential" interpretation
destroys the validity of _Disamis_, _Datisi_, _Felapton_, and
_Fresison_.

Some of "The Logicians" will, no doubt, be ready to reply "But we are
not _Aldrichians_! Why should _we_ be responsible for the validity of
the Syllogisms of so antiquated an author as Aldrich?"

Very good. Then, for the _special_ benefit of these "friends" of mine
(with what ominous emphasis that name is sometimes used! "I must have a
private interview with _you_, my young _friend_," says the bland Dr.
Birch, "in my library, at 9 a.m. tomorrow. And you will please to be
_punctual_!"), for their _special_ benefit, I say, I will produce
_another_ charge against this "non-existential" interpretation.

It actually invalidates the ordinary Process of "Conversion", as applied
to Proposition in '_I_'.

_Every_ logician, Aldrichian or otherwise, accepts it as an established
fact that "Some x are y" may be legitimately converted into "Some y are
x."

But is it equally clear that the Proposition "If there _were_ any x,
some of them _would_ be y" may be legitimately converted into "If there
_were_ any y, some of them would be x"? I trow not.

The example I have already used----of a Boys' School with a non-existent
First Class----will serve admirably to illustrate this new flaw in the
theory of "The Logicians."
                                                                   pg171
Let us suppose that there is yet _another_ Rule in this School, viz. "In
each Class, at the end of the Term, the head boy and the second boy
shall receive prizes."

This Rule entirely authorises us to assert (in the sense in which "The
Logicians" would use the words) "Some boys in the First Class will
receive prizes", for this simply means (according to them) "If there
_were_ any boys in the First Class, some of them _would_ receive
prizes."

Now the Converse of this Proposition is, of course, "Some boys, who will
receive prizes, are in the First Class", which means (according to "The
Logicians") "If there _were_ any boys about to receive prizes, some of
them _would_ be in the First Class" (which Class we know to be _empty_).

Of this Pair of Converse Propositions, the first is undoubtedly _true_:
the second, _as_ undoubtedly, _false_.

It is always sad to see a batsman knock down his own wicket: one pities
him, as a man and a brother, but, as a _cricketer_, one can but
pronounce him "Out!"

We see, then, that, among all the conceivable views we have here
considered, there are only _two_ which can _logically_ be held, viz.

    _I_ and _A_ "assert", but _E_ does not.
    _E_ and _A_ "assert", but _I_ does not.

The _second_ of these I have shown to involve great practical
inconvenience.

The _first_ is the one adopted in this book. (See p. 19.)

Some further remarks on this subject will be found in Note (B), at p.
196.


§ 3.

_The use of "is-not" (or "are-not") as a Copula._


Is it better to say "John _is-not_ in-the-house" or "John _is_
not-in-the-house"? "Some of my acquaintances _are-not_
men-I-should-like-to-be-seen-with" or "Some of my acquaintances _are_
men-I-should-_not_-like-to-be-seen-with"? That is the sort of question
we have now to discuss.
                                                                   pg172
This is no question of Logical Right and Wrong: it is merely a matter of
_taste_, since the two forms mean exactly the same thing. And here,
again, "The Logicians" seem to me to take much too humble a position.
When they are putting the final touches to the grouping of their
Proposition, just before the curtain goes up, and when the
Copula----always a rather fussy 'heavy father', asks them "Am _I_ to
have the 'not', or will you tack it on to the Predicate?" they are much
too ready to answer, like the subtle cab-driver, "Leave it to _you_,
Sir!" The result seems to be, that the grasping Copula constantly gets a
"not" that had better have been merged in the Predicate, and that
Propositions are differentiated which had better have been recognised as
precisely similar. Surely it is simpler to treat "Some men are Jews" and
"Some men are Gentiles" as being both of them, _affirmative_
Propositions, instead of translating the latter into "Some men are-not
Jews", and regarding it as a _negative_ Propositions?

The fact is, "The Logicians" have somehow acquired a perfectly _morbid_
dread of negative Attributes, which makes them shut their eyes, like
frightened children, when they come across such terrible Propositions as
"All not-x are y"; and thus they exclude from their system many very
useful forms of Syllogisms.

Under the influence of this unreasoning terror, they plead that, in
Dichotomy by Contradiction, the _negative_ part is too large to deal
with, so that it is better to regard each Thing as either included in,
or excluded from, the _positive_ part. I see no force in this plea: and
the facts often go the other way. As a personal question, dear Reader,
if _you_ were to group your acquaintances into the two Classes, men that
you _would_ like to be seen with, and men that you would _not_ like to
be seen with, do you think the latter group would be so _very_ much the
larger of the two?

For the purposes of Symbolic Logic, it is so _much_ the most convenient
plan to regard the two sub-divisions, produced by Dichotomy, on the
_same_ footing, and to say, of any Thing, either that it "is" in the
one, or that it "is" in the other, that I do not think any Reader of
this book is likely to demur to my adopting that course.

                                                                   pg173
§ 4.

_The theory that "two Negative Premisses prove nothing"._


This I consider to be _another_ craze of "The Logicians", fully as
morbid as their dread of a negative Attribute.

It is, perhaps, best refuted by the method of _Instantia Contraria_.

Take the following Pairs of Premisses:--

    "None of my boys are conceited;
     None of my girls are greedy".

    "None of my boys are clever;
     None but a clever boy could solve this problem".

    "None of my boys are learned;
     Some of my boys are not choristers".

(This last Proposition is, in _my_ system, an _affirmative_ one, since I
should read it "are not-choristers"; but, in dealing with "The
Logicians," I may fairly treat it as a _negative_ one, since _they_
would read it "are-not choristers".)

If you, dear Reader, declare, after full consideration of these Pairs of
Premisses, that you cannot deduce a Conclusion from _any_ of
them----why, all I can say is that, like the Duke in Patience, you "will
have to be contented with our heart-felt sympathy"! [See Note (C), p.
196.]


§ 5.

_Euler's Method of Diagrams._


Diagrams seem to have been used, at first, to represent _Propositions_
only. In Euler's well-known Circles, each was supposed to contain a
class, and the Diagram consisted of two circles, which exhibited the
relations, as to inclusion and exclusion, existing between the two
Classes.

        _____
      _/ ___ \_
     /  / y \  \
    |   \___/   |
     \_   x   _/
       \_____/

Thus, the Diagram, here given, exhibits the two Classes, whose
respective Attributes are x and y, as so related to each other that the
following Propositions are all simultaneously true:--"All x are y", "No
x are not-y", "Some x are y", "Some y are not-x", "Some not-y are
not-x", and, of course, the Converses of the last four.
                                                                   pg174
        _____
      _/ ___ \_
     /  / y \  \
    |   \___/   |
     \_   x   _/
       \_____/

Similarly, with this Diagram, the following Propositions are true:--"All
y are x", "No y are not-x", "Some y are x", "Some x are not-y", "Some
not-x are not-y", and, of course, the Converses of the last four.

        _____           _____
      _/     \_       _/     \_
     /         \     /         \
    |     x     |   |     y     |
     \_       _/     \_       _/
       \_____/         \_____/

Similarly, with this Diagram, the following are true:--"All x are
not-y", "All y are not-x", "No x are y", "Some x are not-y", "Some y are
not-x", "Some not-x are not-y", and the Converses of the last four.

        _____   _____
      _/     \_/     \_
     /       / \       \
    |     x |   | y     |
     \_      \_/      _/
       \_____/ \_____/

Similarly, with this Diagram, the following are true:--"Some x are y",
"Some x are not-y", "Some not-x are y", "Some not-x are not-y", and of
course, their four Converses.

Note that _all_ Euler's Diagrams assert "Some not-x are not-y."
Apparently it never occured to him that it might _sometimes_ fail to be
true!

Now, to represent "All x are y", the _first_ of these Diagrams would
suffice. Similarly, to represent "No x are y", the _third_ would
suffice. But to represent any _Particular_ Proposition, at least _three_
Diagrams would be needed (in order to include all the possible cases),
and, for "Some not-x are not-y", all the _four_.


§ 6.

_Venn's Method of Diagrams._


Let us represent "not-x" by "x'".

Mr. Venn's Method of Diagrams is a great advance on the above Method.

He uses the last of the above Diagrams to represent _any_ desired
relation between x and y, by simply shading a Compartment known to be
_empty_, and placing a + in one known to be _occupied_.

Thus, he would represent the three Propositions "Some x are y", "No x
are y", and "All x are y", as follows:--

        _____   _____
      _/     \_/     \_
     /       / \       \
    |       | + |       |
     \_      \_/      _/
       \_____/ \_____/

        _____   _____
      _/     \_/     \_
     /       /#\       \
    |       |###|       |
     \_      \#/      _/
       \_____/ \_____/

        _____   _____
      _/#####\_/     \_
     /#######/ \       \
    |#######| + |       |
     \#######\_/      _/
       \#####/ \_____/
                                                                   pg175
It will be seen that, of the _four_ Classes, whose peculiar Sets of
Attributes are xy, xy', x'y, and x'y', only _three_ are here provided
with closed Compartments, while the _fourth_ is allowed the rest of the
Infinite Plane to range about in!

This arrangement would involve us in very serious trouble, if we ever
attempted to represent "No x' are y'." Mr. Venn _once_ (at p. 281)
encounters this awful task; but evades it, in a quite masterly fashion,
by the simple foot-note "We have not troubled to shade the outside of
this diagram"!

To represent _two_ Propositions (containing a common Term) _together_, a
_three_-letter Diagram is needed. This is the one used by Mr. Venn.

             _____
           _/     \_
         _/___ x ___\_
       _/|    \_/    |\_
      /   \_  / \  _/   \
     |      \|___|/      |
      \_  m   \_/   y  _/
        \_____/ \_____/

Here, again, we have only _seven_ closed Compartments, to accommodate
the _eight_ Classes whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are xym, xym', &c.

"With four terms in request," Mr. Venn says, "the most simple and
symmetrical diagram seems to me that produced by making four ellipses
intersect one another in the desired manner". This, however, provides
only _fifteen_ closed compartments.

         b  ____    ____  c
           /    \  /    \
    a  ___/___   \/   ___\___  d
      /   \   \  /\  /   /   \
     /     \   \/  \/   /     \
     \      \  /\  /\  /      /
      \      \/  \/  \/      /
       \     /\  /\  /\     /
        \    \ \/  \/ /    /
         \    \/\  /\/    /
          \   /\_\/_/\   /
           \__\______/__/

For _five_ letters, "the simplest diagram I can suggest," Mr. Venn says,
"is one like this (the small ellipse in the centre is to be regarded as
a portion of the _outside_ of c; i.e. its four component portions are
inside b and d but are no part of c). It must be admitted that such a
diagram is not quite so simple to draw as one might wish it to be; but
then consider what the alternative is of one undertakes to deal with
five terms and all their combinations--nothing short of the disagreeable
task of writing out, or in some way putting before us, all the 32
combinations involved."

                   b      c      d
                 ______  ____  ______
          ______/_     \/    \/     _\______
      a  /     /  \    /\    /\    /  \     \  e
        /     /    \  /  \  /  \  /    \     \
       /      \     \/    \/    \/     /      \
      /        \    /\    /\    /\    /        \
     /          \  /  \  /  \  /  \  /          \
    |            \/    \/ __ \/    \/            |
    |            /\    /\/  \/\    /\            |
    |           /  \  / /\  /\ \  /  \           |

       \        /  \  /  \  /  \  /  \        /
        \      /    \/    \/    \/    \      /
         \     \    /\    /\    /\    /     /
          \     \  /  \  /  \  /  \  /     /
           \     \/    \/    \/    \/     /
            \    /\____/\____/\____/\    /
             \  /                    \  /
              \|                      |/
                \____________________/
                                                                   pg176
This Diagram gives us 31 closed compartments.

For _six_ letters, Mr. Venn suggests that we might use _two_ Diagrams,
like the above, one for the f-part, and the other for the not-f-part, of
all the other combinations. "This", he says, "would give the desired 64
subdivisions." This, however, would only give 62 closed Compartments,
and _one_ infinite area, which the two Classes, a'b'c'd'e'f and
a'b'c'd'e'f', would have to share between them.

Beyond _six_ letters Mr. Venn does not go.


§ 7.

_My Method of Diagrams._


My Method of Diagrams _resembles_ Mr. Venn's, in having separate
Compartments assigned to the various Classes, and in marking these
Compartments as _occupied_ or as _empty_; but it _differs_ from his
Method, in assigning a _closed_ area to the _Universe of Discourse_, so
that the Class which, under Mr. Venn's liberal sway, has been ranging at
will through Infinite Space, is suddenly dismayed to find itself
"cabin'd, cribb'd, confined", in a limited Cell like any other Class!
Also I use _rectilinear_, instead of _curvilinear_, Figures; and I mark
an _occupied_ Cell with a 'I' (meaning that there is at least _one_
Thing in it), and an _empty_ Cell with a 'O' (meaning that there is _no_
Thing in it).

For _two_ letters, I use this Diagram, in which the North Half is
assigned to 'x', the South to 'not-x' (or 'x''), the West to y, and the
East to y'. Thus the N.W. Cell contains the xy-Class, the N.E. Cell the
xy'-Class, and so on.

    ·-------·
    |   |   |
    |---|---|
    |   |   |
    ·-------·

For _three_ letters, I subdivide these four Cells, by drawing an _Inner_
Square, which I assign to m, the _Outer_ Border being assigned to m'. I
thus get _eight_ Cells that are needed to accommodate the eight Classes,
whose peculiar Sets of Attributes are xym, xym', &c.

    ·---------------·

    |   ·---|---·   |

    |       |       |
    ·---------------·

This last Diagram is the most complex that I use in the _Elementary_
Part of my 'Symbolic Logic.' But I may as well take this opportunity of
describing the more complex ones which will appear in Part II.
                                                                   pg177
For _four_ letters (which I call a, b, c, d) I use this Diagram;
assigning the North Half to a (and of course the _rest_ of the Diagram
to a'), the West Half to b, the Horizontal Oblong to c, and the Upright
Oblong to d. We have now got 16 Cells.

    |          |          |
    ·---------------------·

For _five_ letters (adding e) I subdivide the 16 Cells of the previous
Diagram by _oblique_ partitions, assigning all the _upper_ portions to
e, and all the _lower_ portions to e'. Here, I admit, we lose the
advantage of having the e-Class all _together_, "in a ring-fence", like
the other 4 Classes. Still, it is very easy to find; and the operation,
of erasing it, is nearly as easy as that of erasing any other Class. We
have now got 32 Cells.

    ·---------------------·

For _six_ letters (adding h, as I avoid _tailed_ letters) I substitute
upright crosses for the oblique partitions, assigning the 4 portions,
into which each of the 16 Cells is thus divided, to the four Classes eh,
eh', e'h, e'h'. We have now got 64 Cells.

For _seven_ letters (adding k) I add, to each upright cross, a little
inner square. All these 16 little squares are assigned to the k-Class,
and all outside them to the k'-Class; so that 8 little Cells (into which
each of the 16 Cells is divided) are respectively assigned to the 8
Classes ehk, ehk', &c. We have now got 128 Cells.

For _eight_ letters (adding l) I place, in each of the 16 Cells, a
_lattice_, which is a reduced copy of the whole Diagram; and, just as
the 16 large Cells of the whole Diagram are assigned to the 16 Classes
abcd, abcd', &c., so the 16 little Cells of each lattice are assigned to
the 16 Classes ehkl, ehkl', &c. Thus, the lattice in the N.W. corner
serves to accommodate the 16 Classes abc'd'ehkl, abc'd'eh'kl', &c. This
Octoliteral Diagram (see next page) contains 256 Cells.

For _nine_ letters, I place 2 Octoliteral Diagrams side by side,
assigning one of them to m, and the other to m'. We have now got 512
Cells.

Finally, for _ten_ letters, I arrange 4 Octoliteral Diagrams, like the
above, in a square, assigning them to the 4 Classes mn, mn', m'n, m'n'.
We have now got 1024 Cells.


§ 8.

_Solution of a Syllogism by various Methods._


The best way, I think, to exhibit the differences between these various
Methods of solving Syllogisms, will be to take a concrete example, and
solve it by each Method in turn. Let us take, as our example, No. 29
(see p. 102).

    "No philosophers are conceited;
     Some conceited persons are not gamblers.
       .'. Some persons, who are not gamblers, are not philosophers."

                                                                   pg180
(1) _Solution by ordinary Method._

These Premisses, as they stand, will give no Conclusion, as they are
both negative.

If by 'Permutation' or 'Obversion', we write the Minor Premiss thus,

    'Some conceited persons are not-gamblers,'

we can get a Conclusion in _Fresison_, viz.

    "No philosophers are conceited;
     Some conceited persons are not-gamblers.
       .'. Some not-gamblers are not philosophers"

This can be proved by reduction to _Ferio_, thus:--

    "No conceited persons are philosophers;
     Some not-gamblers are conceited.
       .'. Some not-gamblers are not philosophers".

The validity of _Ferio_ follows directly from the Axiom '_De Omni et
Nullo_'.


(2) _Symbolic Representation._

Before proceeding to discuss other Methods of Solution, it is necessary
to translate our Syllogism into an _abstract_ form.

Let us take "persons" as our 'Universe of Discourse'; and let
x = "philosophers", m = "conceited", and y = "gamblers."

Then the Syllogism may be written thus:--

    "No x are m;
     Some m are y'.
       .'. Some y' are x'."


(3) _Solution by Euler's Method of Diagrams._

The Major Premiss requires only _one_ Diagram, viz.

                 1
        _____         _____
      _/     \_     _/     \_

The Minor requires _three_, viz.

                 2
        _____         _____
      _/     \_     _/     \_

The combination of Major and Minor, in every possible way requires
_nine_, viz.

       \_____/       \_____/

From this group (Figs. 5 to 13) we have, by disregarding m, to find the
relation of x and y. On examination we find that Figs. 5, 10, 13 express
the relation of entire mutual exclusion; that Figs. 6, 11 express
partial inclusion and partial exclusion; that Fig. 7 expresses
coincidence; that Figs. 8, 12 express entire inclusion of x in y; and
that Fig. 9 expresses entire inclusion of y in x.
                                                                   pg182
We thus get five Biliteral Diagrams for x and y, viz.

where the only Proposition, represented by them all, is "Some not-y are
not-x," i.e. "Some persons, who are not gamblers, are not
philosophers"----a result which Euler would hardly have regarded as a
_valuable_ one, since he seems to have assumed that a Proposition of
this form is _always_ true!


(4) _Solution by Venn's Method of Diagrams._

The following Solution has been kindly supplied to me Mr. Venn himself.

"The Minor Premiss declares that some of the constituents in my' must be
saved: mark these constituents with a cross.

            _____
          _/  +  \_
        _/___   ___\_
      _/|##+#\_/    |\_
     /   \###/#\  _/   \
    | +    \|_#_|/      |
     \_  m   \_/   y  _/
       \_____/ \_____/

The Major declares that all xm must be destroyed; erase it.

Then, as some my' is to be saved, it must clearly be my'x'. That is,
there must exist my'x'; or eliminating m, y'x'. In common phraseology,

'Some y' are x',' or, 'Some not-gamblers are not-philosophers.'"

                                                                   pg183
(5) _Solution by my Method of Diagrams._

The first Premiss asserts that no xm exist: so we mark the
xm-Compartment as empty, by placing a 'O' in each of its Cells.

The second asserts that some my' exist: so we mark the my'-Compartment
as occupied, by placing a 'I' in its only available Cell.

    ·---------------·
    |       |       |
    |   ·---|---·   |
    |   |(O)|(O)|   |
    |---|---|---|---|
    |   |   |(I)|   |
    |   ·---|---·   |
    |       |       |
    ·---------------·

The only information, that this gives us as to x and y, is that the
x'y'-Compartment is _occupied_, i.e. that some x'y' exist.

Hence "Some x' are y'": i.e. "Some persons, who are not philosophers,
are not gamblers".


(6) _Solution by my Method of Subscripts._

    xm_{0} + my'_{1} ¶ x'y'_{1}

i.e. "Some persons, who are not philosophers, are not gamblers."


§ 9.

_My Method of treating Syllogisms and Sorites._


Of all the strange things, that are to be met with in the ordinary
text-books of Formal Logic, perhaps the strangest is the violent
contrast one finds to exist between their ways of dealing with these two
subjects. While they have elaborately discussed no less than _nineteen_
different forms of _Syllogisms_----each with its own special and
exasperating Rules, while the whole constitute an almost useless
machine, for practical purposes, many of the Conclusions being
incomplete, and many quite legitimate forms being ignored----they have
limited _Sorites_ to _two_ forms only, of childish simplicity; and these
they have dignified with special _names_, apparently under the
impression that no other possible forms existed!

As to _Syllogisms_, I find that their nineteen forms, with about a score
of others which they have ignored, can all be arranged under _three_
forms, each with a very simple Rule of its own; and the only question
the Reader has to settle, in working any one of the 101 Examples given
at p. 101 of this book, is "Does it belong to Fig. I., II., or III.?"
                                                                   pg184
As to _Sorites_, the only two forms, recognised by the text-books, are
the _Aristotelian_, whose Premisses are a series of Propositions in A,
so arranged that the Predicate of each is the Subject of the next, and
the _Goclenian_, whose Premisses are the very same series, written
backwards. Goclenius, it seems, was the first who noticed the startling
fact that it does not affect the force of a Syllogism to invert the
order of its Premisses, and who applied this discovery to a Sorites. If
we assume (as surely we may?) that he is the _same_ man as that
transcendent genius who first noticed that 4 times 5 is the same thing
as 5 times 4, we may apply to him what somebody (Edmund Yates, I think
it was) has said of Tupper, viz., "here is a man who, beyond all others
of his generation, has been favoured with Glimpses of the Obvious!"

These puerile----not to say infantine----forms of a Sorites I have, in
this book, ignored from the very first, and have not only admitted
freely Propositions in _E_, but have purposely stated the Premisses in
random order, leaving to the Reader the useful task of arranging them,
for himself, in an order which can be worked as a series of regular
Syllogisms. In doing this, he can begin with _any one_ of them he likes.

I have tabulated, for curiosity, the various orders in which the
Premisses of the Aristotelian Sorites

    1. All a are b;
    2. All b are c;
    3. All c are d;
    4. All d are e;
    5. All e are h.
       .'. All a are h.

may be syllogistically arranged, and I find there are no less than
_sixteen_ such orders, viz., 12345, 21345, 23145, 23415, 23451, 32145,
32415, 32451, 34215, 34251, 34521, 43215, 43251, 43521, 45321, 54321. Of
these the _first_ and the _last_ have been dignified with names; but the
other _fourteen_----first enumerated by an obscure Writer on Logic,
towards the end of the Nineteenth Century----remain without a name!

§ 10.

_Some account of Parts II, III._


In Part II. will be found some of the matters mentioned in this
Appendix, viz., the "Existential Import" of Propositions, the use of a
_negative_ Copula, and the theory that "two negative Premisses prove
nothing." I shall also extend the range of Syllogisms, by introducing
Propositions containing alternatives (such as "Not-all x are y"),
Propositions containing 3 or more Terms (such as "All ab are c", which,
taken along with "Some bc' are d", would prove "Some d are a'"), &c. I
shall also discuss Sorites containing Entities, and the _very_ puzzling
subjects of Hypotheticals and Dilemmas. I hope, in the course of Part
II., to go over all the ground usually traversed in the text-books used
in our Schools and Universities, and to enable my Readers to solve
Problems of the same kind as, and far harder than, those that are at
present set in their Examinations.

In Part III. I hope to deal with many curious and out-of-the-way
subjects, some of which are not even alluded to in any of the treatises
I have met with. In this Part will be found such matters as the Analysis
of Propositions into their Elements (let the Reader, who has never gone
into this branch of the subject, try to make out for himself what
_additional_ Proposition would be needed to convert "Some a are b" into
"Some a are bc"), the treatment of Numerical and Geometrical Problems,
the construction of Problems, and the solution of Syllogisms and Sorites
containing Propositions more complex than any that I have used in Part
II.

I will conclude with eight Problems, as a taste of what is coming in
Part II. I shall be very glad to receive, from any Reader, who thinks he
has solved any one of them (more especially if he has done so _without_
using any Method of Symbols), what he conceives to be its complete
Conclusion.

It may be well to explain what I mean by the _complete_ Conclusion of a
Syllogism or a Sorites. I distinguish their Terms as being of two
kinds----those which _can_ be eliminated (e.g. the Middle Term of a
Syllogism), which I call the "Eliminands," and those which _cannot_,
which I call the "Retinends"; and I do not call the Conclusion
_complete_, unless it states _all_ the relations among the Retinends
only, which can be deduced from the Premisses.

                                                                   pg186

All the boys, in a certain School, sit together in one large room every
evening. They are of no less than _five_ nationalities----English,
Scotch, Welsh, Irish, and German. One of the Monitors (who is a great
reader of Wilkie Collins' novels) is very observant, and takes MS. notes
of almost everything that happens, with the view of being a good
sensational witness, in case any conspiracy to commit a murder should be
on foot. The following are some of his notes:--

(1) Whenever some of the English boys are singing "Rule Britannia", and
some not, some of the Monitors are wide-awake;

(2) Whenever some of the Scotch are dancing reels, and some of the Irish
fighting, some of the Welsh are eating toasted cheese;

(3) Whenever all the Germans are playing chess, some of the Eleven are
_not_ oiling their bats;

(4) Whenever some of the Monitors are asleep, and some not, some of the
Irish are fighting;

(5) Whenever some of the Germans are playing chess, and none of the
Scotch are dancing reels, some of the Welsh are _not_ eating toasted
cheese;

(6) Whenever some of the Scotch are _not_ dancing reels, and some of the
Irish _not_ fighting, some of the Germans are playing chess;

(7) Whenever some of the Monitors are awake, and some of the Welsh are
eating toasted cheese, none of the Scotch are dancing reels;

(8) Whenever some of the Germans are _not_ playing chess, and some of
the Welsh are _not_ eating toasted cheese, none of the Irish are
fighting;
                                                                   pg187
(9) Whenever all the English are singing "Rule Britannia," and some of
the Scotch are _not_ dancing reels, none of the Germans are playing
chess;

(10) Whenever some of the English are singing "Rule Britannia", and some
of the Monitors are asleep, some of the Irish are _not_ fighting;

(11) Whenever some of the Monitors are awake, and some of the Eleven are
_not_ oiling their bats, some of the Scotch are dancing reels;

(12) Whenever some of the English are singing "Rule Britannia", and some
of the Scotch are _not_ dancing reels, * * * *

Here the MS. breaks off suddenly. The Problem is to complete the
sentence, if possible.

    [N.B. In solving this Problem, it is necessary to remember that
    the Proposition "All x are y" is a _Double_ Proposition, and is
    equivalent to "Some x are y, and none are y'." See p. 17.]

Six friends, and their six wives, are staying in the same hotel; and
they all walk out daily, in parties of various size and composition. To
ensure variety in these daily walks, they have agree to observe the
following Rules:--

(1) If Acres is with (i.e. is in the same party with) his wife, and
Barry with his, and Eden with Mrs. Hall, Cole must be with Mrs. Dix;

(2) If Acres is with his wife, and Hall with his, and Barry with Mrs.
Cole, Dix must _not_ be with Mrs. Eden;

(3) If Cole and Dix and their wives are all in the same party, and Acres
_not_ with Mrs. Barry, Eden must _not_ be with Mrs. Hall;

(4) If Acres is with his wife, and Dix with his, and Barry _not_ with
Mrs. Cole, Eden must be with Mrs. Hall;

(5) If Eden is with his wife, and Hall with his, and Cole with Mrs. Dix,
Acres must _not_ be with Mrs. Barry;

(6) If Barry and Cole and their wives are all in the same party, and
Eden _not_ with Mrs. Hall, Dix must be with Mrs. Eden.

The Problem is to prove that there must be, every day, at least _one_
married couple who are not in the same party.

                                                                   pg192

After the six friends, named in Problem 5, had returned from their tour,
three of them, Barry, Cole, and Dix, agreed, with two other friends of
theirs, Lang and Mill, that the five should meet, every day, at a
certain _table d'hôte_. Remembering how much amusement they had derived
from their code of rules for walking-parties, they devised the following
rules to be observed whenever beef appeared on the table:--

(1) If Barry takes salt, then either Cole or Lang takes _one_ only of
the two condiments, salt and mustard: if he takes mustard, then either
Dix takes neither condiment, or Mill takes both.

(2) If Cole takes salt, then either Barry takes only _one_ condiment, or
Mill takes neither: if he takes mustard, then either Dix or Lang takes
both.

(3) If Dix takes salt, then either Barry takes neither condiment or Cole
take both: if he takes mustard, then either Lang or Mill takes neither.

(4) If Lang takes salt, then Barry or Dix takes only _one_ condiment: if
he takes mustard, then either Cole or Mill takes neither.

(5) If Mill takes salt, then either Barry or Lang takes both condiments:
if he takes mustard, then either Cole or Dix takes only _one_.

The Problem is to discover whether these rules are _compatible_; and, if
so, what arrangements are possible.

    [N.B. In this Problem, it is assumed that the phrase "if Barry
    takes salt" allows of _two_ possible cases, viz. (1) "he takes
    salt _only_"; (2) "he takes _both_ condiments". And so with all
    similar phrases.

    It is also assumed that the phrase "either Cole or Lang takes
    _one_ only of the two condiments" allows _three_ possible cases,
    viz. (1) "Cole takes _one_ only, Lang takes both or neither";
    (2) "Cole takes both or neither, Lang takes _one_ only"; (3)
    "Cole takes _one_ only, Lang takes _one_ only". And so with all
    similar phrases.

    It is also assumed that every rule is to be understood as
    implying the words "and _vice versâ_." Thus the first rule would
    imply the addition "and, if either Cole or Lang takes only _one_
    condiment, then Barry takes salt."]

from self-consciousness;

and who are not both of them ugly, are always admired;

(11) Men, who hold opposite views about Art and are not admired, always
give themselves airs;

(12) Brothers of the same height always differ in Politics;

NOTES TO APPENDIX.


(A) [See p. 167, line 6.]

It may, perhaps, occur to the Reader, who has studied Formal Logic that
the argument, here applied to the Propositions I and E, will apply
equally well to the Propositions I and A (since, in the ordinary
text-books, the Propositions "All xy are z" and "Some xy are not z" are
regarded as Contradictories). Hence it may appear to him that the
argument might have been put as follows:--

"We now have I and A 'asserting.' Hence, if the Proposition 'All xy are
z' be true, some things exist with the Attributes x and y: i.e. 'Some x
are y.'

"Also we know that, if the Proposition 'Some xy are not-z' be true the
same result follows.

"But these two Propositions are Contradictories, so that one or other of
them _must_ be true. Hence this result is always true: i.e. the
Proposition 'Some x are y' is _always_ true!

"_Quod est absurdum._ Hence I _cannot_ assert."

This matter will be discussed in Part II; but I may as well give here
what seems to me to be an irresistable proof that this view (that _A_
and _I_ are Contradictories), though adopted in the ordinary text-books,
is untenable. The proof is as follows:--

With regard to the relationship existing between the Class 'xy' and the
two Classes 'z' and 'not-z', there are _four_ conceivable states of
things, viz.

    (1) Some xy are z, and some are not-z;
    (2)    "      "        none     "
    (3) No xy     "        some     "
    (4)    "      "        none     "

Of these four, No. (2) is equivalent to "All xy are z", No. (3) is
equivalent to "All xy are not-z", and No. (4) is equivalent to "No xy
exist."

Now it is quite undeniable that, of these _four_ states of things, each
is, _a priori_, _possible_, some _one must_ be true, and the other three
_must_ be false.

Hence the Contradictory to (2) is "Either (1) or (3) or (4) is true."
Now the assertion "Either (1) or (3) is true" is equivalent to "Some xy
are not-z"; and the assertion "(4) is true" is equivalent to "No xy
exist." Hence the Contradictory to "All xy are z" may be expressed as
the Alternative Proposition "Either some xy are not-z, or no xy exist,"
but _not_ as the Categorical Proposition "Some y are not-z."

                                                                   pg196

There are yet _other_ views current among "The Logicians", as to the
"Existential Import" of Propositions, which have not been mentioned in
this Section.

One is, that the Proposition "some x are y" is to be interpreted,
neither as "Some x _exist_ and are y", nor yet as "If there _were_ any x
in existence, some of them _would_ be y", but merely as "Some x _can be_
y; i.e. the Attributes x and y are _compatible_". On _this_ theory,
there would be nothing offensive in my telling my friend Jones "Some of
your brothers are swindlers"; since, if he indignantly retorted "What do
you _mean_ by such insulting language, you scoundrel?", I should calmly
reply "I merely mean that the thing is _conceivable_----that some of
your brothers _might possibly_ be swindlers". But it may well be doubted
whether such an explanation would _entirely_ appease the wrath of Jones!

Another view is, that the Proposition "All x are y" _sometimes_ implies
the actual _existence_ of x, and _sometimes_ does _not_ imply it; and
that we cannot tell, without having it in _concrete_ form, _which_
interpretation we are to give to it. _This_ view is, I think, strongly
supported by common usage; and it will be fully discussed in Part II:
but the difficulties, which it introduces, seem to me too formidable to
be even alluded to in Part I, which I am trying to make, as far as
possible, easily intelligible to mere _beginners_.

The three Conclusions are

    "No conceited child of mine is greedy";
    "None of my boys could solve this problem";
    "Some unlearned boys are not choristers."

THE GAME OF LOGIC

By Lewis Carrol



  To my Child-friend.

  I charm in vain; for never again,
  All keenly as my glance I bend,
    Will Memory, goddess coy,
    Embody for my joy
  Departed days, nor let me gaze
    On thee, my fairy friend!

  Yet could thy face, in mystic grace,
  A moment smile on me, 'twould send
    Far-darting rays of light
    From Heaven athwart the night,
  By which to read in very deed
    Thy spirit, sweetest friend!

  So may the stream of Life's long dream
  Flow gently onward to its end,
    With many a floweret gay,
    Adown its willowy way:
  May no sigh vex, no care perplex,
    My loving little friend!



NOTA BENE.

With each copy of this Book is given an Envelope, containing a
Diagram (similar to the frontispiece) on card, and nine Counters,
four red and five grey.

The Envelope, &c. can be had separately, at 3d. each.

The Author will be very grateful for suggestions, especially from
beginners in Logic, of any alterations, or further explanations,
that may seem desirable.  Letters should be addressed to him at
"29, Bedford Street, Covent Garden, London."



PREFACE



"There foam'd rebellious Logic, gagg'd and bound."


This Game requires nine Counters--four of one colour and five of
another:  say four red and five grey.

Besides the nine Counters, it also requires one Player, AT LEAST.
I am not aware of any Game that can be played with LESS than this
number:  while there are several that require MORE:  take Cricket,
for instance, which requires twenty-two.  How much easier it is,
when you want to play a Game, to find ONE Player than twenty-two.
At the same time, though one Player is enough, a good deal more
amusement may be got by two working at it together, and correcting
each other's mistakes.

A second advantage, possessed by this Game, is that, besides being
an endless source of amusement (the number of arguments, that may
be worked by it, being infinite), it will give the Players a little
instruction as well.  But is there any great harm in THAT, so long
as you get plenty of amusement?

CHAPTER I.

NEW LAMPS FOR OLD.





             "Light come, light go."
                    _________

                1.  Propositions.

            "Some new Cakes are nice."
            "No new Cakes are nice."
            "All new cakes are nice."

There are three 'PROPOSITIONS' for you--the only three kinds we
are going to use in this Game:  and the first thing to be done is
to learn how to express them on the Board.

Let us begin with

"Some new Cakes are nice."

But before doing so, a remark has to be made--one that is rather
important, and by no means easy to understand all in a moment:  so
please to read this VERY carefully.

The world contains many THINGS (such as "Buns", "Babies", "Beetles".
"Battledores". &c.);  and these Things possess many ATTRIBUTES
(such as "baked", "beautiful", "black", "broken", &c.:  in fact,
whatever can be "attributed to", that is "said to belong to", any
Thing, is an Attribute).  Whenever we wish to mention a Thing, we
use a SUBSTANTIVE:  when we wish to mention an Attribute, we use
an ADJECTIVE.  People have asked the question "Can a Thing exist
without any Attributes belonging to it?"  It is a very puzzling
question, and I'm not going to try to answer it:  let us turn up
our noses, and treat it with contemptuous silence, as if it really
wasn't worth noticing.  But, if they put it the other way, and ask
"Can an Attribute exist without any Thing for it to belong to?", we
may say at once "No:  no more than a Baby could go a railway-journey
with no one to take care of it!"  You never saw "beautiful" floating
about in the air, or littered about on the floor, without any Thing
to BE beautiful, now did you?

And now what am I driving at, in all this long rigmarole?  It is
this.  You may put "is" or "are" between names of two THINGS (for
example, "some Pigs are fat Animals"), or between the names of two
ATTRIBUTES (for example, "pink is light-red"), and in each case it
will make good sense.  But, if you put "is" or "are" between the
name of a THING and the name of an ATTRIBUTE (for example, "some
Pigs are pink"), you do NOT make good sense (for how can a Thing
BE an Attribute?) unless you have an understanding with the person
to whom you are speaking.  And the simplest understanding would, I
think, be this--that the Substantive shall be supposed to be repeated
at the end of the sentence, so that the sentence, if written out
in full, would be "some Pigs are pink (Pigs)".  And now the word
"are" makes quite good sense.

Thus, in order to make good sense of the Proposition "some new Cakes
are nice", we must suppose it to be written out in full, in the
form "some new Cakes are nice (Cakes)".  Now this contains two
'TERMS'--"new Cakes" being one of them, and "nice (Cakes)" the
other.  "New Cakes," being the one we are talking about, is called
the 'SUBJECT' of the Proposition, and "nice (Cakes)" the 'PREDICATE'.
Also this Proposition is said to be a 'PARTICULAR' one, since it
does not speak of the WHOLE of its Subject, but only of a PART of
it.  The other two kinds are said to be 'UNIVERSAL', because they
speak of the WHOLE of their Subjects--the one denying niceness, and
the other asserting it, of the WHOLE class of "new Cakes".  Lastly,
if you would like to have a definition of the word 'PROPOSITION'
itself, you may take this:--"a sentence stating that some, or
none, or all, of the Things belonging to a certain class, called
its 'Subject', are also Things belonging to a certain other class,
called its 'Predicate'".

You will find these seven words--PROPOSITION, ATTRIBUTE, TERM,
SUBJECT, PREDICATE, PARTICULAR, UNIVERSAL--charmingly useful, if
any friend should happen to ask if you have ever studied Logic.
Mind you bring all seven words into your answer, and you friend
will go away deeply impressed--'a sadder and a wiser man'.

Now please to look at the smaller Diagram on the Board, and suppose
it to be a cupboard, intended for all the Cakes in the world (it
would have to be a good large one, of course).  And let us suppose
all the new ones to be put into the upper half (marked 'x'), and all
the rest (that is, the NOT-new ones) into the lower half (marked
'x'').  Thus the lower half would contain ELDERLY Cakes, AGED
Cakes, ANTE-DILUVIAN Cakes--if there are any:  I haven't seen many,
myself--and so on.  Let us also suppose all the nice Cakes to be
put into the left-hand half (marked 'y'), and all the rest (that
is, the not-nice ones) into the right-hand half (marked 'y'').  At
present, then, we must understand x to mean "new", x' "not-new",
y "nice", and y' "not-nice."

And now what kind of Cakes would you expect to find in compartment
No. 5?

It is part of the upper half, you see; so that, if it has any Cakes
in it, they must be NEW: and it is part of the left-hand half;
so that they must be NICE.  Hence if there are any Cakes in this
compartment, they must have the double 'ATTRIBUTE' "new and nice":
or, if we use letters, the must be "x y."

Observe that the letters x, y are written on two of the edges of
this compartment.  This you will find a very convenient rule for
knowing what Attributes belong to the Things in any compartment.
Take No. 7, for instance.  If there are any Cakes there, they must
be "x' y", that is, they must be "not-new and nice."

Now let us make another agreement--that a red counter in a
compartment shall mean that it is 'OCCUPIED', that is, that there
are SOME Cakes in it.  (The word 'some,' in Logic, means 'one or
more' so that a single Cake in a compartment would be quite enough
reason for saying "there are SOME Cakes here").  Also let us agree
that a grey counter in a compartment shall mean that it is 'EMPTY',
that is that there are NO Cakes in it.  In the following Diagrams,
I shall put '1' (meaning 'one or more') where you are to put a RED
counter, and '0' (meaning 'none') where you are to put a GREY one.

As the Subject of our Proposition is to be "new Cakes", we are only
concerned, at present, with the UPPER half of the cupboard, where
all the Cakes have the attribute x, that is, "new."

Now, fixing our attention on this upper half, suppose we found it
marked like this,


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  1  |     |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


that is, with a red counter in No. 5.  What would this tell us,
with regard to the class of "new Cakes"?

Would it not tell us that there are SOME of them in the x y-compartment?
That is, that some of them (besides having the Attribute x, which
belongs to both compartments) have the Attribute y (that is, "nice").
This we might express by saying "some x-Cakes are y-(Cakes)", or,
putting words instead of letters,


"Some new Cakes are nice (Cakes)",


or, in a shorter form,


"Some new Cakes are nice".


At last we have found out how to represent the first Proposition
of this Section.  If you have not CLEARLY understood all I have
said, go no further, but read it over and over again, till you DO
understand it.  After that is once mastered, you will find all the
rest quite easy.

It will save a little trouble, in doing the other Propositions,
if we agree to leave out the word "Cakes" altogether.  I find it
convenient to call the whole class of Things, for which the cupboard
is intended, the 'UNIVERSE.'  Thus we might have begun this business
by saying "Let us take a Universe of Cakes."  (Sounds nice, doesn't
it?)

Of course any other Things would have done just as well as Cakes.
We might make Propositions about "a Universe of Lizards", or even
"a Universe of Hornets".  (Wouldn't THAT be a charming Universe to
live in?)

So far, then, we have learned that


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  1  |     |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


means "some x and y," i.e. "some new are nice."

I think you will see without further explanation, that


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |     |  1  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


means "some x are y'," i.e. "some new are not-nice."

Now let us put a GREY counter into No. 5, and ask ourselves the
meaning of


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  0  |     |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


This tells us that the x y-compartment is EMPTY, which we may express
by "no x are y", or, "no new Cakes are nice".  This is the second
of the three Propositions at the head of this Section.

In the same way,


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |     |  0  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


would mean "no x are y'," or, "no new Cakes are not-nice."

What would you make of this, I wonder?


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  1  |  1  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


I hope you will not have much trouble in making out that this
represents a DOUBLE Proposition: namely, "some x are y, AND some
are y'," i.e. "some new are nice, and some are not-nice."

The following is a little harder, perhaps:


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  0  |  0  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


This means "no x are y, AND none are y'," i.e. "no new are nice,
AND none are not-nice": which leads to the rather curious result
that "no new exist," i.e. "no Cakes are new."  This is because
"nice" and "not-nice" make what we call an 'EXHAUSTIVE' division
of the class "new Cakes": i.e. between them, they EXHAUST the whole
class, so that all the new Cakes, that exist, must be found in one
or the other of them.

And now suppose you had to represent, with counters the contradictory
to "no Cakes are new", which would be "some Cakes are new", or,
putting letters for words, "some Cakes are x", how would you do
it?

This will puzzle you a little, I expect.  Evidently you must put
a red counter SOMEWHERE in the x-half of the cupboard, since you
know there are SOME new Cakes.  But you must not put it into the
LEFT-HAND compartment, since you do not know them to be NICE: nor
may you put it into the RIGHT-HAND one, since you do not know them
to be NOT-NICE.

What, then, are you to do?  I think the best way out of the
difficulty is to place the red counter ON THE DIVISION-LINE between
the xy-compartment and the xy'-compartment.  This I shall represent
(as I always put '1' where you are to put a red counter) by the
diagram


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |    -1-    |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


Our ingenious American cousins have invented a phrase to express
the position of a man who wants to join one or the other of two
parties--such as their two parties 'Democrats' and 'Republicans'--but
can't make up his mind WHICH.  Such a man is said to be "sitting
on the fence."  Now that is exactly the position of the red counter
you have just placed on the division-line.  He likes the look of
No. 5, and he likes the look of No. 6, and he doesn't know WHICH to
jump down into.  So there he sits astride, silly fellow, dangling
his legs, one on each side of the fence!

Now I am going to give you a much harder one to make out.  What
does this mean?


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  1  |  0  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


This is clearly a DOUBLE Proposition.  It tells us not only that
"some x are y," but also the "no x are NOT y."  Hence the result
is "ALL x are y," i.e.  "all new Cakes are nice", which is the last
of the three Propositions at the head of this Section.

We see, then, that the Universal Proposition


"All new Cakes are nice"


consists of TWO Propositions taken together, namely,


             "Some new Cakes are nice,"
        and "No new Cakes are not-nice."


In the same way


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  0  |  1  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


would mean "all x are y' ", that is,


"All new Cakes are not-nice."


Now what would you make of such a Proposition as "The Cake you have
given me is nice"?  Is it Particular or Universal?


"Particular, of course," you readily reply.  "One single Cake is
hardly worth calling 'some,' even."


No, my dear impulsive Reader, it is 'Universal'.  Remember that,
few as they are (and I grant you they couldn't well be fewer),
they are (or rather 'it is') ALL that you have given me!  Thus, if
(leaving 'red' out of the question) I divide my Universe of Cakes
into two classes--the Cakes you have given me (to which I assign
the upper half of the cupboard), and those you HAVEN'T given me
(which are to go below)--I find the lower half fairly full, and the
upper one as nearly as possible empty.  And then, when I am told
to put an upright division into each half, keeping the NICE Cakes
to the left, and the NOT-NICE ones to the right, I begin by carefully
collecting ALL the Cakes you have given me (saying to myself, from
time to time, "Generous creature!  How shall I ever repay such
kindness?"), and piling them up in the left-hand compartment.  AND
IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG TO DO IT!

Here is another Universal Proposition for you.  "Barzillai Beckalegg
is an honest man."  That means "ALL the Barzillai Beckaleggs, that
I am now considering, are honest men."  (You think I invented that
name, now don't you?  But I didn't.  It's on a carrier's cart,
somewhere down in Cornwall.)

This kind of Universal Proposition (where the Subject is a single
Thing) is called an 'INDIVIDUAL' Proposition.

Now let us take "NICE Cakes" as the Subject of Proposition: that
is, let us fix our thoughts on the LEFT-HAND half of the cupboard,
where all the Cakes have attribute y, that is, "nice."


                                            -----
  Suppose we find it marked like this:--   |     |
                                           |  1  |
  What would that tell us?                 |     |
                                            -----
                                           |     |
                                           |     |
                                           |     |
                                            -----


I hope that it is not necessary, after explaining the HORIZONTAL
oblong so fully, to spend much time over the UPRIGHT one.  I hope
you will see, for yourself, that this means "some y are x", that
is,


"Some nice Cakes are new."


"But," you will say, "we have had this case before.  You put a red
counter into No. 5, and you told us it meant 'some new Cakes are
nice'; and NOW you tell us that it means 'some NICE Cakes are NEW'!
Can it mean BOTH?"

The question is a very thoughtful one, and does you GREAT credit,
dear Reader!  It DOES mean both. If you choose to take x (that
is, "new Cakes") as your Subject, and to regard No. 5 as part of a
HORIZONTAL oblong, you may read it "some x are y", that is, "some
new Cakes are nice": but, if you choose to take y (that is, "nice
Cake") as your Subject, and to regard No. 5 as part of an UPRIGHT
oblong, THEN you may read it "some y are x", that is, "some nice
Cakes are new".  They are merely two different ways of expressing
the very same truth.

Without more words, I will simply set down the other ways in which
this upright oblong might be marked, adding the meaning in each
case.  By comparing them with the various cases of the horizontal
oblong, you will, I hope, be able to understand them clearly.

You will find it a good plan to examine yourself on this table,
by covering up first one column and then the other, and 'dodging
about', as the children say.

Also you will do well to write out for yourself two other tables--one
for the LOWER half of the cupboard, and the other for its RIGHT-HAND
half.

And now I think we have said all we need to say about the smaller
Diagram, and may go on to the larger one.

This may be taken to be a cupboard divided in the same way as the
last, but ALSO divided into two portions, for the Attribute m.  Let
us give to m the meaning "wholesome": and let us suppose that all
WHOLESOME Cakes are placed INSIDE the central Square, and all the
UNWHOLESOME ones OUTSIDE it, that is, in one or other of the four
queer-shaped OUTER compartments.

We see that, just as, in the smaller Diagram, the Cakes in each
compartment had TWO Attributes, so, here, the Cakes in each compartment
have THREE Attributes: and, just as the letters, representing the
TWO Attributes, were written on the EDGES of the compartment, so,
here, they are written at the CORNERS.  (Observe that m' is supposed
to be written at each of the four outer corners.)  So that we can
tell in a moment, by looking at a compartment, what three Attributes
belong to the Things in it.  For instance, take No. 12.  Here we
find x, y', m, at the corners: so we know that the Cakes in it, if
there are any, have the triple Attribute, 'xy'm', that is, "new,
not-nice, and wholesome." Again, take No. 16.  Here we find, at
the corners, x', y', m': so the Cakes in it are "not-new, not-nice,
and unwholesome."  (Remarkably untempting Cakes!)

It would take far too long to go through all the Propositions,
containing x and y, x and m, and y and m which can be represented
on this diagram (there are ninety-six altogether, so I am sure you
will excuse me!) and I must content myself with doing two or three,
as specimens.  You will do well to work out a lot more for yourself.

Taking the upper half by itself, so that our Subject is "new Cakes",
how are we to represent "no new Cakes are wholesome"?

This is, writing letters for words, "no x are m."  Now this tells us
that none of the Cakes, belonging to the upper half of the cupboard,
are to be found INSIDE the central Square: that is, the two
compartments, No. 11 and No. 12, are EMPTY.  And this, of course,
is represented by


                   -------------------
                  |         |         |
                  |    _____|_____    |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |  0  |  0  |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                   -------------------


And now how are we to represent the contradictory Proposition "SOME x
are m"?  This is a difficulty I have already considered.  I think
the best way is to place a red counter ON THE DIVISION-LINE between
No. 11 and No. 12, and to understand this to mean that ONE of the
two compartments is 'occupied,' but that we do not at present know WHICH.
This I shall represent thus:--


                   -------------------
                  |         |         |
                  |    _____|_____    |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |    -1-    |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                   -------------------

Now let us express "all x are m."

This consists, we know, of TWO Propositions,


                 "Some x are m,"
             and "No x are m'."

Let us express the negative part first.  This tells us that none
of the Cakes, belonging to the upper half of the cupboard, are to
be found OUTSIDE the central Square: that is, the two compartments,
No. 9 and No. 10, are EMPTY.  This, of course, is represented by


                   -------------------
                  | 0       |       0 |
                  |    _____|_____    |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                   -------------------

But we have yet to represent "Some x are m."  This tells us that
there are SOME Cakes in the oblong consisting of No. 11 and No.
12: so we place our red counter, as in the previous example, on
the division-line between No. 11 and No. 12, and the result is


                   -------------------
                  | 0       |       0 |
                  |    _____|_____    |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |    -1-    |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                   -------------------


Now let us try one or two interpretations.

What are we to make of this, with regard to x and y?


                   -------------------
                  |         |       0 |
                  |    _____|_____    |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |  1  |  0  |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                   -------------------


This tells us, with regard to the xy'-Square, that it is wholly
'empty', since BOTH compartments are so marked.  With regard to
the xy-Square, it tells us that it is 'occupied'.  True, it is only
ONE compartment of it that is so marked; but that is quite enough,
whether the other be 'occupied' or 'empty', to settle the fact that
there is SOMETHING in the Square.

If, then, we transfer our marks to the smaller Diagram, so as to
get rid of the m-subdivisions, we have a right to mark it


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  1  |  0  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


which means, you know, "all x are y."

The result would have been exactly the same, if the given oblong
had been marked thus:--


                   -------------------
                  | 1       |       0 |
                  |    _____|_____    |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |     |  0  |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                   -------------------


Once more: how shall we interpret this, with regard to x and y?


                   -------------------
                  | 0       |       1 |
                  |    _____|_____    |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                   -------------------


This tells us, as to the xy-Square, that ONE of its compartments
is 'empty'.  But this information is quite useless, as there is no
mark in the OTHER compartment.  If the other compartment happened
to be 'empty' too, the Square would be 'empty': and, if it happened
to be 'occupied', the Square would be 'occupied'.  So, as we do
not know WHICH is the case, we can say nothing about THIS Square.

The other Square, the xy'-Square, we know (as in the previous
example) to be 'occupied'.

If, then, we transfer our marks to the smaller Diagram, we get
merely this:--


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |     |  1  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


which means, you know, "some x are y'."

These principles may be applied to all the other
oblongs.  For instance, to represent
"all y' are m'" we should mark the     -------
RIGHT-HAND UPRIGHT OBLONG (the one    |       |
that has the attribute y') thus:--    |---    |
                                      | 0 |   |
                                      |---|-1-|
                                      | 0 |   |
                                      |---    |
                                      |       |
                                       -------

and, if we were told to interpret the lower half of the cupboard,
marked as follows, with regard to x and y,


                   -------------------
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |   |     |  0  |   |
                  |   |     |     |   |
                  |    -----|-----    |
                  | 1       |       0 |
                   -------------------


we should transfer it to the smaller Diagram thus,


                      -----------
                     |     |     |
                     |  1  |  0  |
                     |     |     |
                      -----------


and read it "all x' are y."

Two more remarks about Propositions need to be made.

One is that, in every Proposition beginning with "some" or "all",
the ACTUAL EXISTENCE of the 'Subject' is asserted.  If, for instance,
I say "all misers are selfish," I mean that misers ACTUALLY EXIST.
If I wished to avoid making this assertion, and merely to state
the LAW that miserliness necessarily involves selfishness, I should
say "no misers are unselfish" which does not assert that any misers
exist at all, but merely that, if any DID exist, they WOULD be
selfish.

The other is that, when a Proposition begins with "some" or "no",
and contains more that two Attributes, these Attributes may be
re-arranged, and shifted from one Term to the other, "ad libitum."
For example, "some abc are def" may be re-arranged as "some bf are
acde," each being equivalent to "some Things are abcdef".  Again "No
wise old men are rash and reckless gamblers" may be re-arranged as
"No rash old gamblers are wise and reckless," each being equivalent
to "No men are wise old rash reckless gamblers."



2.  Syllogisms


Now suppose we divide our Universe of Things in three ways, with regard
to three different Attributes.  Out of these three Attributes, we
may make up three different couples (for instance, if they were a,
b, c, we might make up the three couples ab, ac, bc).  Also suppose
we have two Propositions given us, containing two of these three
couples, and that from them we can prove a third Proposition containing
the third couple.  (For example, if we divide our Universe for m,
x, and y; and if we have the two Propositions given us, "no m are
x'" and "all m' are y", containing the two couples mx and my, it
might be possible to prove from them a third Proposition, containing
x and y.)

In such a case we call the given Propositions 'THE PREMISSES', the
third one 'THE CONCLUSION' and the whole set 'A SYLLOGISM'.

Evidently, ONE of the Attributes must occur in both Premisses; or
else one must occur in ONE Premiss, and its CONTRADICTORY in the
other.

In the first case (when, for example, the Premisses are "some m
are x" and "no m are y'") the Term, which occurs twice, is called
'THE MIDDLE TERM', because it serves as a sort of link between the
other two Terms.

In the second case (when, for example, the Premisses are "no
m are x'" and "all m' are y") the two Terms, which contain these
contradictory Attributes, may be called 'THE MIDDLE TERMS'.

Thus, in the first case, the class of "m-Things" is the Middle
Term; and, in the second case, the two classes of "m-Things" and
"m'-Things" are the Middle Terms.

The Attribute, which occurs in the Middle Term or Terms, disappears
in the Conclusion, and is said to be "eliminated", which literally
means "turned out of doors".

Now let us try to draw a Conclusion from the two Premisses--

          "Some new Cakes are unwholesome;
           No nice Cakes are unwholesome."

In order to express them with counters, we need to divide Cakes in
THREE different ways, with regard to newness, to niceness, and to
wholesomeness.  For this we must use the larger Diagram, making x
mean "new", y "nice", and m "wholesome".  (Everything INSIDE the
central Square is supposed to have the attribute m, and everything
OUTSIDE it the attribute m', i.e. "not-m".)

You had better adopt the rule to make m mean the Attribute which
occurs in the MIDDLE Term or Terms.  (I have chosen m as the symbol,
because 'middle' begins with 'm'.)

Now, in representing the two Premisses, I prefer to begin with the
NEGATIVE one (the one beginning with "no"), because GREY counters
can always be placed with CERTAINTY, and will then help to fix the
position of the red counters, which are sometimes a little uncertain
where they will be most welcome.

Let us express, the "no nice Cakes are unwholesome (Cakes)", i.e.
"no y-Cakes are m'-(Cakes)".  This tells us that none of the Cakes
belonging to the y-half of the cupboard are in its m'-compartments
(i.e. the ones outside the central Square).  Hence the two compartments,
No. 9 and No. 15, are both 'EMPTY'; and we must place a grey counter
in EACH of them, thus:--


                    -----------
                   |0    |     |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |  |  |  |  |
                   |--|-----|--|
                   |  |  |  |  |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |0    |     |
                    -----------


We have now to express the other Premiss, namely, "some new Cakes
are unwholesome (Cakes)", i.e.  "some x-Cakes are m'-(Cakes)".  This
tells us that some of the Cakes in the x-half of the cupboard are
in its m'-compartments.  Hence ONE of the two compartments, No.
9 and No. 10, is 'occupied': and, as we are not told in WHICH of
these two compartments to place the red counter, the usual rule
would be to lay it on the division-line between them: but, in this
case, the other Premiss has settled the matter for us, by declaring
No. 9 to be EMPTY.  Hence the red counter has no choice, and MUST
go into No. 10, thus:--


                    -----------
                   |0    |    1|
                   |   --|--   |
                   |  |  |  |  |
                   |--|-----|--|
                   |  |  |  |  |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |0    |     |
                    -----------


And now what counters will this information enable us to place in
the SMALLER Diagram, so as to get some Proposition involving x and
y only, leaving out m?  Let us take its four compartments, one by
one.

First, No. 5.  All we know about THIS is that its OUTER portion
is empty: but we know nothing about its inner portion.  Thus the
Square MAY be empty, or it MAY have something in it.  Who can tell?
So we dare not place ANY counter in this Square.

Secondly, what of No. 6?  Here we are a little better off.  We
know that there is SOMETHING in it, for there is a red counter in
its outer portion.  It is true we do not know whether its inner
portion is empty or occupied: but what does THAT matter?  One solitary
Cake, in one corner of the Square, is quite sufficient excuse for
saying "THIS SQUARE IS OCCUPIED", and for marking it with a red
counter.

As to No. 7, we are in the same condition as with No. 5--we find
it PARTLY 'empty', but we do not know whether the other part is
empty or occupied: so we dare not mark this Square.

And as to No. 8, we have simply no information at all.

The result is

                     -------
                    |   | 1 |
                    |---|---|
                    |   |   |
                     -------


Our 'Conclusion', then, must be got out of the rather meager piece
of information that there is a red counter in the xy'-Square.
Hence our Conclusion is "some x are y' ", i.e. "some new Cakes are
not-nice (Cakes)": or, if you prefer to take y' as your Subject,
"some not-nice Cakes are new (Cakes)"; but the other looks neatest.

We will now write out the whole Syllogism, putting the symbol
&there4[*] for "therefore", and omitting "Cakes", for the sake of
brevity, at the end of each Proposition.

[*][NOTE from Brett:  The use of "&there4" is a rather arbitrary
selection.  There is no font available in general practice
which renders the "therefore" symbol correction (three dots in a
triangular formation).  This can be done, however, in HTML, so if
this document is read in a browser, then the symbol will be properly
recognized.  This is a poor man's excuse.]

          "Some new Cakes are unwholesome;
           No nice Cakes are unwholesome
           &there4 Some new Cakes are not-nice."

And you have now worked out, successfully, your first 'SYLLOGISM'.
Permit me to congratulate you, and to express the hope that it is
but the beginning of a long and glorious series of similar victories!

We will work out one other Syllogism--a rather harder one than the
last--and then, I think, you may be safely left to play the Game
by yourself, or (better) with any friend whom you can find, that
is able and willing to take a share in the sport.

Let us see what we can make of the two Premisses--


              "All Dragons are uncanny;
               All Scotchmen are canny."


Remember, I don't guarantee the Premisses to be FACTS.  In the
first place, I never even saw a Dragon: and, in the second place,
it isn't of the slightest consequence to us, as LOGICIANS, whether
our Premisses are true or false: all WE have to do is to make out
whether they LEAD LOGICALLY TO THE CONCLUSION, so that, if THEY
were true, IT would be true also.

You see, we must give up the "Cakes" now, or our cupboard will
be of no use to us.  We must take, as our 'Universe', some class
of things which will include Dragons and Scotchmen: shall we say
'Animals'?  And, as "canny" is evidently the Attribute belonging
to the 'Middle Terms', we will let m stand for "canny", x for
"Dragons", and y for "Scotchmen".  So that our two Premisses are,
in full,


   "All Dragon-Animals are uncanny (Animals);
   All Scotchman-Animals are canny (Animals)."


And these may be expressed, using letters for words, thus:--


                "All x are m';
                 All y are m."


The first Premiss consists, as you already know, of two parts:--


                 "Some x are m',"
             and "No x are m."


And the second also consists of two parts:--


                 "Some y are m,"
             and "No y are m'."


Let us take the negative portions first.

We have, then, to mark, on the larger Diagram, first, "no x are
m", and secondly, "no y are m'".  I think you will see, without
further explanation, that the two results, separately, are


       -----------           -----------
      |     |     |         |0    |     |
      |   --|--   |         |   --|--   |
      |  |0 | 0|  |         |  |  |  |  |
      |--|--|--|--|         |--|--|--|--|
      |  |  |  |  |         |  |  |  |  |
      |   --|--   |         |   --|--   |
      |     |     |         |0    |     |
       -----------           -----------



and that these two, when combined, give us


                    -----------
                   |0    |     |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |  |0 | 0|  |
                   |--|--|--|--|
                   |  |  |  |  |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |0    |     |
                    -----------


We have now to mark the two positive portions, "some x are m'"
and "some y are m".

The only two compartments, available for Things which are xm', are
No. 9 and No. 10.  Of these, No. 9 is already marked as 'empty';
so our red counter must go into No. 10.

Similarly, the only two, available for ym, are No. 11 and No. 13.
Of these, No. 11 is already marked as 'empty'; so our red counter
MUST go into No. 13.

The final result is


                    -----------
                   |0    |    1|
                   |   --|--   |
                   |  |0 | 0|  |
                   |--|--|--|--|
                   |  |1 |  |  |
                   |   --|--   |
                   |0    |     |
                    -----------



And now how much of this information can usefully be transferred
to the smaller Diagram?

Let us take its four compartments, one by one.

As to No. 5?  This, we see, is wholly 'empty'. (So mark it with a
grey counter.)

As to No. 6?  This, we see, is 'occupied'.  (So mark it with a red
counter.)

As to No. 7?  Ditto, ditto.

As to No. 8?  No information.

The smaller Diagram is now pretty liberally marked:--


                     -------
                    | 0 | 1 |
                    |---|---|
                    | 1 |   |
                     -------


And now what Conclusion can we read off from this?  Well, it is
impossible to pack such abundant information into ONE Proposition:
we shall have to indulge in TWO, this time.

First, by taking x as Subject, we get "all x are y'", that is,


"All Dragons are not-Scotchmen":


secondly, by taking y as Subject, we get "all y are x'", that is,


"All Scotchmen are not-Dragons".


Let us now write out, all together, our two Premisses and our brace
of Conclusions.


        "All Dragons are uncanny;
         All Scotchmen are canny.
         &there4  All Dragons are not-Scotchmen;
                  All Scotchmen are not-Dragons."


Let me mention, in conclusion, that you may perhaps meet with
logical treatises in which it is not assumed that any Thing EXISTS
at all, by "some x are y" is understood to mean "the Attributes x,
y are COMPATIBLE, so that a Thing can have both at once", and "no
x are y" to mean "the Attributes x, y are INCOMPATIBLE, so that
nothing can have both at once".

In such treatises, Propositions have quite different meanings
from what they have in our 'Game of Logic', and it will be well to
understand exactly what the difference is.

First take "some x are y".  Here WE understand "are" to mean "are,
as an actual FACT"--which of course implies that some x-Things EXIST.
But THEY (the writers of these other treatises) only understand
"are" to mean "CAN be", which does not at all imply that any EXIST.
So they mean LESS than we do: our meaning includes theirs (for of
course "some x ARE y" includes "some x CAN BE y"), but theirs does
NOT include ours.  For example, "some Welsh hippopotami are heavy"
would be TRUE, according to these writers (since the Attributes
"Welsh" and "heavy" are quite COMPATIBLE in a hippopotamus), but
it would be FALSE in our Game (since there are no Welsh hippopotami
to BE heavy).

Secondly, take "no x are y".  Here WE only understand "are" to
mean "are, as an actual FACT"--which does not at all imply that no
x CAN be y.  But THEY understand the Proposition to mean, not only
that none ARE y, but that none CAN POSSIBLY be y.  So they mean
more than we do: their meaning includes ours (for of course "no x
CAN be y" includes "no x ARE y"), but ours does NOT include theirs.
For example, "no Policemen are eight feet high" would be TRUE
in our Game (since, as an actual fact, no such splendid specimens
are ever found), but it would be FALSE, according to these writers
(since the Attributes "belonging to the Police Force" and "eight
feet high" are quite COMPATIBLE:  there is nothing to PREVENT a
Policeman from growing to that height, if sufficiently rubbed with
Rowland's Macassar Oil--which said to make HAIR grow, when rubbed
on hair, and so of course will make a POLICEMAN grow, when rubbed
on a Policeman).

Thirdly, take "all x are y", which consists of the two partial
Propositions "some x are y" and "no x are y'".  Here, of course,
the treatises mean LESS than we do in the FIRST part, and more than
we do in the SECOND.  But the two operations don't balance each
other--any more than you can console a man, for having knocked down
one of his chimneys, by giving him an extra door-step.

If you meet with Syllogisms of this kind, you may work them, quite
easily, by the system I have given you: you have only to make
'are' mean 'are CAPABLE of being', and all will go smoothly.  For
"some x are y" will become "some x are capable of being y", that
is, "the Attributes x, y are COMPATIBLE".  And "no x are y" will
become "no x are capable of being y", that is, "the Attributes
x, y are INCOMPATIBLE".  And, of course, "all x are y" will become
"some x are capable of being y, and none are capable of being y'",
that is, "the Attributes x, y are COMPATIBLE, and the Attributes
x, y' are INCOMPATIBLE."  In using the Diagrams for this system,
you must understand a red counter to mean "there may POSSIBLY be
something in this compartment," and a grey one to mean "there cannot
POSSIBLY be anything in this compartment."



3. Fallacies.


And so you think, do you, that the chief use of Logic, in real life,
is to deduce Conclusions from workable Premisses, and to satisfy
yourself that the Conclusions, deduced by other people, are correct?
I only wish it were!  Society would be much less liable to panics
and other delusions, and POLITICAL life, especially, would be a
totally different thing, if even a majority of the arguments, that
scattered broadcast over the world, were correct!  But it is all
the other way, I fear.  For ONE workable Pair of Premisses (I mean
a Pair that lead to a logical Conclusion) that you meet with in
reading your newspaper or magazine, you will probably find FIVE
that lead to no Conclusion at all: and, even when the Premisses
ARE workable, for ONE instance, where the writer draws a correct
Conclusion, there are probably TEN where he draws an incorrect one.

In the first case, you may say "the PREMISSES are fallacious": in
the second, "the CONCLUSION is fallacious."

The chief use you will find, in such Logical skill as this Game
may teach you, will be in detecting 'FALLACIES' of these two kinds.

The first kind of Fallacy--'Fallacious Premisses'--you will detect
when, after marking them on the larger Diagram, you try to transfer
the marks to the smaller.  You will take its four compartments, one
by one, and ask, for each in turn, "What mark can I place HERE?";
and in EVERY one the answer will be "No information!", showing that
there is NO CONCLUSION AT ALL.  For instance,


          "All soldiers are brave;
           Some Englishmen are brave.
            &there4 Some Englishmen are soldiers."


looks uncommonly LIKE a Syllogism, and might easily take in a
less experienced Logician.  But YOU are not to be caught by such
a trick!  You would simply set out the Premisses, and would then
calmly remark "Fallacious PREMISSES!": you wouldn't condescend to
ask what CONCLUSION the writer professed to draw--knowing that,
WHATEVER it is, it MUST be wrong.  You would be just as safe as
that wise mother was, who said "Mary, just go up to the nursery,
and see what Baby's doing, AND TELL HIM NOT TO DO IT!"

The other kind of Fallacy--'Fallacious Conclusion'--you will not
detect till you have marked BOTH Diagrams, and have read off the
correct Conclusion, and have compared it with the Conclusion which
the writer has drawn.

But mind, you mustn't say "FALLACIOUS Conclusion," simply because
it is not IDENTICAL with the correct one: it may be a PART of the
correct Conclusion, and so be quite correct, AS FAR AS IT GOES.  In
this case you would merely remark, with a pitying smile, "DEFECTIVE
Conclusion!" Suppose, of example, you were to meet with this
Syllogism:--


           "All unselfish people are generous;
            No misers are generous.
                 &there4 No misers are unselfish."


the Premisses of which might be thus expressed in letters:--


               "All x' are m;
                No y are m."


Here the correct Conclusion would be "All x' are y'" (that is,
"All unselfish people are not misers"), while the Conclusion, drawn
by the writer, is "No y are x'," (which is the same as "No x' are
y," and so is PART of "All x' are y'.")  Here you would simply say
"DEFECTIVE Conclusion!" The same thing would happen, if you were
in a confectioner's shop, and if a little boy were to come in, put
down twopence, and march off triumphantly with a single penny-bun.
You would shake your head mournfully, and would remark "Defective
Conclusion!  Poor little chap!"  And perhaps you would ask the
young lady behind the counter whether she would let YOU eat the
bun, which the little boy had paid for and left behind him: and
perhaps SHE would reply "Sha'n't!"

But if, in the above example, the writer had drawn the Conclusion
"All misers are selfish" (that is, "All y are x"), this would
be going BEYOND his legitimate rights (since it would assert the
EXISTENCE of y, which is not contained in the Premisses), and you
would very properly say "Fallacious Conclusion!"

Now, when you read other treatises on Logic, you will meet with
various kinds of (so-called) 'Fallacies' which are by no means
ALWAYS so.  For example, if you were to put before one of these
Logicians the Pair of Premisses


          "No honest men cheat;
           No dishonest men are trustworthy."


and were to ask him what Conclusion followed, he would probably say
"None at all!  Your Premisses offend against TWO distinct Rules, and
are as fallacious as they can well be!"  Then suppose you were bold
enough to say "The Conclusion is 'No men who cheat are trustworthy',"
I fear your Logical friend would turn away hastily--perhaps angry,
perhaps only scornful: in any case, the result would be unpleasant.
I ADVISE YOU NOT TO TRY THE EXPERIMENT!

"But why is this?" you will say.  "Do you mean to tell us that all
these Logicians are wrong?"  Far from it, dear Reader!  From THEIR
point of view, they are perfectly right.  But they do not include,
in their system, anything like ALL the possible forms of Syllogisms.

They have a sort of nervous dread of Attributes beginning with a
negative particle.  For example, such Propositions as "All not-x
are y," "No x are not-y," are quite outside their system.  And
thus, having (from sheer nervousness) excluded a quantity of very
useful forms, they have made rules which, though quite applicable
to the few forms which they allow of, are no use at all when you
consider all possible forms.

Let us not quarrel with them, dear Reader!  There is room enough in
the world for both of us.  Let us quietly take our broader system:
and, if they choose to shut their eyes to all these useful forms,
and to say "They are not Syllogisms at all!" we can but stand aside,
and let them Rush upon their Fate!  There is scarcely anything of
yours, upon which it is so dangerous to Rush, as your Fate.  You
may Rush upon your Potato-beds, or your Strawberry-beds, without
doing much harm: you may even Rush upon your Balcony (unless it
is a new house, built by contract, and with no clerk of the works)
and may survive the foolhardy enterprise: but if you once Rush upon
your FATE--why, you must take the consequences!

CHAPTER III.

CROOKED ANSWERS.

            "I answered him, as I thought good,
             'As many as red-herrings grow in the wood'."

__________






1.  Elementary.



1.  Whatever can be "attributed to", that is "said to belong to",
a Thing, is called an 'Attribute'.  For example, "baked", which
can (frequently) be attributed to "Buns", and "beautiful", which
can (seldom) be attributed to "Babies".

2.  When they are the Names of two Things (for example, "these
Pigs are fat Animals"), or of two Attributes (for example, "pink
is light red").

3.  When one is the Name of a Thing, and the other the Name of an
Attribute (for example, "these Pigs are pink"), since a Thing cannot
actually BE an Attribute.

4.  That the Substantive shall be supposed to be repeated at the
end of the sentence (for example, "these Pigs are pink (Pigs)").

5.  A 'Proposition' is a sentence stating that some, or none, or all,
of the Things belonging to a certain class, called the 'Subject',
are also Things belonging to a certain other class, called the
'Predicate'.  For example, "some new Cakes are not nice", that is
(written in full) "some new Cakes are not nice Cakes"; where the
class "new Cakes" is the Subject, and the class "not-nice Cakes"
is the Predicate.

6.  A Proposition, stating that SOME of the Things belonging to
its Subject are so-and-so, is called 'Particular'.  For example,
"some new Cakes are nice", "some new Cakes are not nice."

A Proposition, stating that NONE of the Things belonging to its
Subject, or that ALL of them, are so-and-so, is called 'Universal'.
For example, "no new Cakes are nice", "all new Cakes are not nice".

7.  The Things in each compartment possess TWO Attributes, whose
symbols will be found written on two of the EDGES of that compartment.

8.  "One or more."

9.  As a name of the class of Things to which the whole Diagram is
assigned.

10.  A Proposition containing two statements.  For example, "some
new Cakes are nice and some are not-nice."

11.  When the whole class, thus divided, is "exhausted" among the
sets into which it is divided, there being no member of it which
does not belong to some one of them.  For example, the class "new
Cakes" is "exhaustively" divided into "nice" and "not-nice" since
EVERY new Cake must be one or the other.

12.  When a man cannot make up his mind which of two parties he
will join, he is said to be "sitting on the fence"--not being able
to decide on which side he will jump down.

13.  "Some x are y" and "no x are y'".

14.  A Proposition, whose Subject is a single Thing, is called
'Individual'.  For example, "I am happy", "John is not at home".
These are Universal Propositions, being the same as "all the I's
that exist are happy", "ALL the Johns, that I am now considering,
are not at home".

15.  Propositions beginning with "some" or "all".

16.  When they begin with "some" or "no".  For example, "some
abc are def" may be re-arranged as "some bf are acde", each being
equivalent to "some abcdef exist".

17.  Some tigers are fierce, No tigers are not-fierce.

18.  Some hard-boiled eggs are unwholesome, No hard-boiled
eggs are wholesome.

19.  Some I's are happy, No I's are unhappy.

20.  Some Johns are not at home, No Johns are at home.

21.  The Things, in each compartment of the larger Diagram, possess
THREE Attributes, whose symbols will be found written at three of
the CORNERS of the compartment (except in the case of m', which is
not actually inserted in the Diagram, but is SUPPOSED to stand at
each of its four outer corners).

22.  If the Universe of Things be divided with regard to three
different Attributes; and if two Propositions be given, containing
two different couples of these Attributes; and if from these we
can prove a third Proposition, containing the two Attributes that
have not yet occurred together; the given Propositions are called
'the Premisses', the third one 'the Conclusion', and the whole set
'a Syllogism'.  For example, the Premisses might be "no m are x'"
and "all m' are y"; and it might be possible to prove from them
a Conclusion containing x and y.

23.  If an Attribute occurs in both Premisses, the Term containing
it is called 'the Middle Term'.  For example, if the Premisses are
"some m are x" and "no m are y'", the class of "m-Things" is 'the
Middle Term.'

If an Attribute occurs in one Premiss, and its contradictory in the
other, the Terms containing them may be called 'the Middle Terms'.
For example, if the Premisses are "no m are x'" and "all m' are
y", the two classes of "m-Things" and "m'-Things" may be called
'the Middle Terms'.

24.  Because they can be marked with CERTAINTY: whereas AFFIRMATIVE
Propositions (that is, those that begin with "some" or "all")
sometimes require us to place a red counter 'sitting on a fence'.

25.  Because the only question we are concerned with is whether the
Conclusion FOLLOWS LOGICALLY from the Premisses, so that, if THEY
were true, IT also would be true.

26.  By understanding a red counter to mean "this compartment CAN
be occupied", and a grey one to mean "this compartment CANNOT be
occupied" or "this compartment MUST be empty".

27.  'Fallacious Premisses' and 'Fallacious Conclusion'.

28.  By finding, when we try to transfer marks from the larger
Diagram to the smaller, that there is 'no information' for any of
its four compartments.

29.  By finding the correct Conclusion, and then observing that
the Conclusion, offered to us, is neither identical with it nor a
part of it.

30.  When the offered Conclusion is PART of the correct Conclusion.
In this case, we may call it a 'Defective Conclusion'.

  20.  We had better take "persons" as Universe.  We
may choose "myself" as 'Middle Term', in which case
the Premisses will take the form

  I am a-person-who-sent-him-to-bring-a-kitten;
  I am a-person-to-whom-he-brought-a-kettle-by-mistake.

Or we may choose "he" as 'Middle Term', in which case the Premisses
will take the form

  He is a-person-whom-I-sent-to-bring-me-a-kitten;
  He is a-person-who-brought-me-a-kettle-by-mistake.

The latter form seems best, as the interest of the anecdote clearly
depends on HIS stupidity--not on what happened to ME.  Let us then
make m = "he"; x = "persons whom I sent, &c."; and y = "persons
who brought, &c."

  Hence, All m are x;
         All m are y.    and the required Diagram is

              i.e.  Some rainy periods are tiresome.

N.B.  These are not legitimate Premisses, since the
Conclusion is really part of the second Premiss, so that the
first Premiss is superfluous.  This may be shown, in letters,
thus:--

"All xm are y" contains "Some xm are y", which
contains "Some x are y".  Or, in words, "All rainy days
are tiresome" contains "Some rainy days are tiresome",
which contains "Some rainy periods are tiresome".

Moreover, the first Premiss, besides being superfluous, is
actually contained in the second; since it is equivalent to
"Some rainy days exist", which, as we know, is implied in
the Proposition "All rainy days are tiresome".

Altogether, a most unsatisfactory Pair of Premisses!

______________


Extract a Pair of Premisses out of each of the following: and
deduce the Conclusion, if there is one:--

92.  "The Lion, as any one can tell you who has been chased by them
as often as I have, is a very savage animal: and there are certain
individuals among them, though I will not guarantee it as a general
law, who do not drink coffee."

93.  "It was most absurd of you to offer it!  You might have known,
if you had had any sense, that no old sailors ever like gruel!"

"But I thought, as he was an uncle of yours--"

"An uncle of mine, indeed!  Stuff!"

"You may call it stuff, if you like.  All I know is, MY uncles are
all old men: and they like gruel like anything!"

"Well, then YOUR uncles are--"

94.  "Do come away!  I can't stand this squeezing any more.  No
crowded shops are comfortable, you know very well."

"Well, who expects to be comfortable, out shopping?"

"Why, I do, of course!  And I'm sure there are some shops, further
down the street, that are not crowded.  So--"

95.  "They say no doctors are metaphysical organists: and that lets
me into a little fact about YOU, you know."

"Why, how do you make THAT out?  You never heard me play the organ."

"No, doctor, but I've heard you talk about Browning's poetry: and
that showed me that you're METAPHYSICAL, at any rate.  So--"

96.  "Don't talk to me!  I've known more rich merchants than you
have: and I can tell you not ONE of them was ever an old miser

"Why, isn't he very rich?"

"Yes, of course he is.  And what then?"

Either he's not a merchant, or he's not a miser!"

deal better to-day."

"And is it Nature, or Art, that is to have the credit of this happy
change?"

"Art, I think.  The Doctor has given me some of that patent medicine

"I don't deny it.  And what then?  I suppose you'll be telling me
some of those flowers are geraniums!"

follow an argument!  But what's the good of proving anything to
YOU, I should like to know?"

think there are SOME of them, at least, that are really ANXIOUS to
learn."

"Very glad to hear it: and how do you make it out to be so?"

"Why, Sir, I know how hard they work--some of them, that is.  Who
should know better?"

It is supposed to be spoken by a fond mother, in answer to a friend's
cautious suggestion that she is perhaps a LITTLE overdoing it, in
the way of lessons, with her children.

101.  "Well, they've got their own way to make in the world.  WE
can't leave them a fortune apiece.  And money's not to be had, as
YOU know, without money's worth: they must WORK if they want to
live.  And how are they to work, if they don't know anything?  Take
my word for it, there's no place for ignorance in THESE times!  And
all authorities agree that the time to learn is when you're young.
One's got no memory afterwards, worth speaking of.  A child will
learn more in an hour than a grown man in five.  So those, that
have to learn, must learn when they're young, if ever they're to
learn at all.  Of course that doesn't do unless children are HEALTHY:
I quite allow THAT.  Well, the doctor tells me no children are
healthy unless they've got a good colour in their cheeks.  And only
just look at my darlings!  Why, their cheeks bloom like peonies!
Well, now, they tell me that, to keep children in health, you
should never give them more than six hours altogether at lessons
in the day, and at least two half-holidays in the week.  And that's
EXACTLY our plan I can assure you!  We never go beyond six hours,
and every Wednesday and Saturday, as ever is, not one syllable of
lessons do they do after their one o'clock dinner!  So how you can
imagine I'm running any risk in the education of my precious pets
is more than I can understand, I promise you!"

PREFACE

If--and the thing is wildly possible--the charge of writing nonsense
were ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive
poem, it would be based, I feel convinced, on the line (in p.4)

          "Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes."

In view of this painful possibility, I will not (as I might) appeal
indignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of
such a deed: I will not (as I might) point to the strong moral purpose
of this poem itself, to the arithmetical principles so cautiously
inculcated in it, or to its noble teachings in Natural History--I will
take the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened.

The Bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances, used
to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished,
and it more than once happened, when the time came for replacing it,
that no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged
to. They knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the Bellman
about it--he would only refer to his Naval Code, and read out in
pathetic tones Admiralty Instructions which none of them had ever been
able to understand--so it generally ended in its being fastened on,
anyhow, across the rudder. The helmsman used to stand by with tears in
his eyes; he knew it was all wrong, but alas!  Rule 42 of the Code, "No
one shall speak to the Man at the Helm," had been completed by the
Bellman himself with the words "and the Man at the Helm shall speak to
no one."  So remonstrance was impossible, and no steering could be done
till the next varnishing day.  During these bewildering intervals the
ship usually sailed backwards.

As this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the Jabberwock,
let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been
asked me, how to pronounce "slithy toves."  The "i" in "slithy" is long,
as in "writhe"; and "toves" is pronounced so as to rhyme with "groves."
Again, the first "o" in "borogoves" is pronounced like the "o" in
"borrow."  I have heard people try to give it the sound of the "o" in
"worry".  Such is Human Perversity.

This also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard works in
that poem.  Humpty-Dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one word
like a portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all.

For instance, take the two words "fuming" and "furious."  Make up your
mind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will
first.  Now open your mouth and speak.  If your thoughts incline
ever so little towards "fuming," you will say "fuming-furious;" if they
turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards "furious," you will say
"furious-fuming;" but if you have the rarest of gifts, a perfectly
balanced mind, you will say "frumious."

Supposing that, when Pistol uttered the well-known words--

          "Under which king, Bezonian?  Speak or die!"

Justice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or Richard,
but had not been able to settle which, so that he could not possibly say
either name before the other, can it be doubted that, rather than die,
he would have gasped out "Rilchiam!"



                 Fit the First

                  THE LANDING


     "Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,
          As he landed his crew with care;
     Supporting each man on the top of the tide
          By a finger entwined in his hair.

     "Just the place for a Snark!  I have said it twice:
          That alone should encourage the crew.
     Just the place for a Snark!  I have said it thrice:
          What I tell you three times is true."

     The crew was complete: it included a Boots--
          A maker of Bonnets and Hoods--
     A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes--
          And a Broker, to value their goods.

     A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,
          Might perhaps have won more than his share--
     But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,
          Had the whole of their cash in his care.

     There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,
          Or would sit making lace in the bow:
     And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,
          Though none of the sailors knew how.

     There was one who was famed for the number of things
          He forgot when he entered the ship:
     His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,
          And the clothes he had bought for the trip.

     He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,
          With his name painted clearly on each:
     But, since he omitted to mention the fact,
          They were all left behind on the beach.

     The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because
          He had seven coats on when he came,
     With three pairs of boots--but the worst of it was,
          He had wholly forgotten his name.

     He would answer to "Hi!" or to any loud cry,
          Such as "Fry me!" or "Fritter my wig!"
     To "What-you-may-call-um!" or "What-was-his-name!"
          But especially "Thing-um-a-jig!"

     While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,
          He had different names from these:
     His intimate friends called him "Candle-ends,"
          And his enemies "Toasted-cheese."

     "His form is ungainly--his intellect small--"
          (So the Bellman would often remark)
     "But his courage is perfect!  And that, after all,
          Is the thing that one needs with a Snark."

     He would joke with hyenas, returning their stare
          With an impudent wag of the head:
     And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,
          "Just to keep up its spirits," he said.

     He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late--
          And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad--
     He could only bake Bridecake--for which, I may state,
          No materials were to be had.

     The last of the crew needs especial remark,
          Though he looked an incredible dunce:
     He had just one idea--but, that one being "Snark,"
          The good Bellman engaged him at once.

     He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,
          When the ship had been sailing a week,
     He could only kill Beavers.  The Bellman looked scared,
          And was almost too frightened to speak:

     But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,
          There was only one Beaver on board;
     And that was a tame one he had of his own,
          Whose death would be deeply deplored.

     The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,
          Protested, with tears in its eyes,
     That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark
          Could atone for that dismal surprise!

     It strongly advised that the Butcher should be
          Conveyed in a separate ship:
     But the Bellman declared that would never agree
          With the plans he had made for the trip:

     Navigation was always a difficult art,
          Though with only one ship and one bell:
     And he feared he must really decline, for his part,
          Undertaking another as well.

     The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure
          A second-hand dagger-proof coat--
     So the Baker advised it--and next, to insure
          Its life in some Office of note:

     This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire
          (On moderate terms), or for sale,
     Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,
          And one Against Damage From Hail.

     Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,
          Whenever the Butcher was by,
     The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,
          And appeared unaccountably shy.



                      Fit the Second

                   THE BELLMAN'S SPEECH


     The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies--
          Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!
     Such solemnity, too!  One could see he was wise,
          The moment one looked in his face!

     He had bought a large map representing the sea,
          Without the least vestige of land:
     And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be
          A map they could all understand.

     "What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,
          Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?"
     So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply
          "They are merely conventional signs!

     "Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!
          But we've got our brave Captain to thank:"
     (So the crew would protest) "that he's bought us the best--
          A perfect and absolute blank!"

     This was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out
          That the Captain they trusted so well
     Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,
          And that was to tingle his bell.

     He was thoughtful and grave--but the orders he gave
          Were enough to bewilder a crew.
     When he cried "Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!"
          What on earth was the helmsman to do?

     Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:
          A thing, as the Bellman remarked,
     That frequently happens in tropical climes,
          When a vessel is, so to speak, "snarked."

     But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,
          And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,
     Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,
          That the ship would not travel due West!

     But the danger was past--they had landed at last,
          With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:
     Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,
          Which consisted of chasms and crags.

     The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,
          And repeated in musical tone
     Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe--
          But the crew would do nothing but groan.

     He served out some grog with a liberal hand,
          And bade them sit down on the beach:
     And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,
          As he stood and delivered his speech.

     "Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!"
          (They were all of them fond of quotations:
     So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,
          While he served out additional rations).

     "We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,
          (Four weeks to the month you may mark),
     But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks)
          Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!

     "We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,
          (Seven days to the week I allow),
     But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,
          We have never beheld till now!

     "Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again
          The five unmistakable marks
     By which you may know, wheresoever you go,
          The warranted genuine Snarks.

     "Let us take them in order.  The first is the taste,
          Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:
     Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,
          With a flavour of Will-o'-the-wisp.

     "Its habit of getting up late you'll agree
          That it carries too far, when I say
     That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea,
          And dines on the following day.

     "The third is its slowness in taking a jest.
          Should you happen to venture on one,
     It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:
          And it always looks grave at a pun.

     "The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,
          Which is constantly carries about,
     And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes--
          A sentiment open to doubt.

     "The fifth is ambition.  It next will be right
          To describe each particular batch:
     Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,
          And those that have whiskers, and scratch.

     "For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,
          Yet, I feel it my duty to say,
     Some are Boojums--" The Bellman broke off in alarm,
          For the Baker had fainted away.



                      Fit the Third

                     THE BAKER'S TALE


     They roused him with muffins--they roused him with ice--
          They roused him with mustard and cress--
     They roused him with jam and judicious advice--
          They set him conundrums to guess.

     When at length he sat up and was able to speak,
          His sad story he offered to tell;
     And the Bellman cried "Silence!  Not even a shriek!"
          And excitedly tingled his bell.

     There was silence supreme!  Not a shriek, not a scream,
          Scarcely even a howl or a groan,
     As the man they called "Ho!" told his story of woe
          In an antediluvian tone.

     "My father and mother were honest, though poor--"
          "Skip all that!" cried the Bellman in haste.
     "If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark--
          We have hardly a minute to waste!"

     "I skip forty years," said the Baker, in tears,
          "And proceed without further remark
     To the day when you took me aboard of your ship
          To help you in hunting the Snark.

     "A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)
          Remarked, when I bade him farewell--"
     "Oh, skip your dear uncle!" the Bellman exclaimed,
          As he angrily tingled his bell.

     "He remarked to me then," said that mildest of men,
          "'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:
     Fetch it home by all means--you may serve it with greens,
          And it's handy for striking a light.

     "'You may seek it with thimbles--and seek it with care;
          You may hunt it with forks and hope;
     You may threaten its life with a railway-share;
          You may charm it with smiles and soap--'"

     ("That's exactly the method," the Bellman bold
          In a hasty parenthesis cried,
     "That's exactly the way I have always been told
          That the capture of Snarks should be tried!")

     "'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,
          If your Snark be a Boojum!  For then
     You will softly and suddenly vanish away,
          And never be met with again!'

     "It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,
          When I think of my uncle's last words:
     And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl
          Brimming over with quivering curds!

     "It is this, it is this--" "We have had that before!"
          The Bellman indignantly said.
     And the Baker replied "Let me say it once more.
          It is this, it is this that I dread!

     "I engage with the Snark--every night after dark--
          In a dreamy delirious fight:
     I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,
          And I use it for striking a light:

     "But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,
          In a moment (of this I am sure),
     I shall softly and suddenly vanish away--
          And the notion I cannot endure!"



                      Fit the fourth

                       THE HUNTING


     The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow.
          "If only you'd spoken before!
     It's excessively awkward to mention it now,
          With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!

     "We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,
          If you never were met with again--
     But surely, my man, when the voyage began,
          You might have suggested it then?

     "It's excessively awkward to mention it now--
          As I think I've already remarked."
     And the man they called "Hi!" replied, with a sigh,
          "I informed you the day we embarked.

     "You may charge me with murder--or want of sense--
          (We are all of us weak at times):
     But the slightest approach to a false pretence
          Was never among my crimes!

     "I said it in Hebrew--I said it in Dutch--
          I said it in German and Greek:
     But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)
          That English is what you speak!"

     "'Tis a pitiful tale," said the Bellman, whose face
          Had grown longer at every word:
     "But, now that you've stated the whole of your case,
          More debate would be simply absurd.

     "The rest of my speech" (he explained to his men)
          "You shall hear when I've leisure to speak it.
     But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!
          'Tis your glorious duty to seek it!

     "To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;
          To pursue it with forks and hope;
     To threaten its life with a railway-share;
          To charm it with smiles and soap!

     "For the Snark's a peculiar creature, that won't
          Be caught in a commonplace way.
     Do all that you know, and try all that you don't:
          Not a chance must be wasted to-day!

     "For England expects--I forbear to proceed:
          'Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:
     And you'd best be unpacking the things that you need
          To rig yourselves out for the fight."

     Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed),
          And changed his loose silver for notes.
     The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,
          And shook the dust out of his coats.

     The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade--
          Each working the grindstone in turn:
     But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed
          No interest in the concern:

     Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,
          And vainly proceeded to cite
     A number of cases, in which making laces
          Had been proved an infringement of right.

     The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned
          A novel arrangement of bows:
     While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand
          Was chalking the tip of his nose.

     But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,
          With yellow kid gloves and a ruff--
     Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,
          Which the Bellman declared was all "stuff."

     "Introduce me, now there's a good fellow," he said,
          "If we happen to meet it together!"
     And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,
          Said "That must depend on the weather."

     The Beaver went simply galumphing about,
          At seeing the Butcher so shy:
     And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,
          Made an effort to wink with one eye.

     "Be a man!" said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard
          The Butcher beginning to sob.
     "Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,
          We shall need all our strength for the job!"



                      Fit the Fifth

                   THE BEAVER'S LESSON


     They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
          They pursued it with forks and hope;
     They threatened its life with a railway-share;
          They charmed it with smiles and soap.

     Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan
          For making a separate sally;
     And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,
          A dismal and desolate valley.

     But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:
          It had chosen the very same place:
     Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,
          The disgust that appeared in his face.

     Each thought he was thinking of nothing but "Snark"
          And the glorious work of the day;
     And each tried to pretend that he did not remark
          That the other was going that way.

     But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,
          And the evening got darker and colder,
     Till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill)
          They marched along shoulder to shoulder.

     Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,
          And they knew that some danger was near:
     The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,
          And even the Butcher felt queer.

     He thought of his childhood, left far far behind--
          That blissful and innocent state--
     The sound so exactly recalled to his mind
          A pencil that squeaks on a slate!

     "'Tis the voice of the Jubjub!" he suddenly cried.
          (This man, that they used to call "Dunce.")
     "As the Bellman would tell you," he added with pride,
          "I have uttered that sentiment once.

     "'Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;
          You will find I have told it you twice.
     'Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,
          If only I've stated it thrice."

     The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,
          Attending to every word:
     But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,
          When the third repetition occurred.

     It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,
          It had somehow contrived to lose count,
     And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains
          By reckoning up the amount.

     "Two added to one--if that could but be done,"
          It said, "with one's fingers and thumbs!"
     Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,
          It had taken no pains with its sums.

     "The thing can be done," said the Butcher, "I think.
          The thing must be done, I am sure.
     The thing shall be done!  Bring me paper and ink,
          The best there is time to procure."

     The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,
          And ink in unfailing supplies:
     While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,
          And watched them with wondering eyes.

     So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,
          As he wrote with a pen in each hand,
     And explained all the while in a popular style
          Which the Beaver could well understand.

     "Taking Three as the subject to reason about--
          A convenient number to state--
     We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out
          By One Thousand diminished by Eight.

     "The result we proceed to divide, as you see,
          By Nine Hundred and Ninety Two:
     Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be
          Exactly and perfectly true.

     "The method employed I would gladly explain,
          While I have it so clear in my head,
     If I had but the time and you had but the brain--
          But much yet remains to be said.

     "In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been
          Enveloped in absolute mystery,
     And without extra charge I will give you at large
          A Lesson in Natural History."

     In his genial way he proceeded to say
          (Forgetting all laws of propriety,
     And that giving instruction, without introduction,
          Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),

     "As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird,
          Since it lives in perpetual passion:
     Its taste in costume is entirely absurd--
          It is ages ahead of the fashion:

     "But it knows any friend it has met once before:
          It never will look at a bribe:
     And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,
          And collects--though it does not subscribe.

     "Its' flavour when cooked is more exquisite far
          Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:
     (Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,
          And some, in mahogany kegs:)

     "You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:
          You condense it with locusts and tape:
     Still keeping one principal object in view--
          To preserve its symmetrical shape."

     The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,
          But he felt that the lesson must end,
     And he wept with delight in attempting to say
          He considered the Beaver his friend.

     While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks
          More eloquent even than tears,
     It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books
          Would have taught it in seventy years.

     They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned
          (For a moment) with noble emotion,
     Said "This amply repays all the wearisome days
          We have spent on the billowy ocean!"

     Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,
          Have seldom if ever been known;
     In winter or summer, 'twas always the same--
          You could never meet either alone.

     And when quarrels arose--as one frequently finds
          Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour--
     The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,
          And cemented their friendship for ever!



                      Fit the Sixth

                  THE BARRISTER'S DREAM


     They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
          They pursued it with forks and hope;
     They threatened its life with a railway-share;
          They charmed it with smiles and soap.

     But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain
          That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,
     Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain
          That his fancy had dwelt on so long.

     He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,
          Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,
     Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig
          On the charge of deserting its sty.

     The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,
          That the sty was deserted when found:
     And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law
          In a soft under-current of sound.

     The indictment had never been clearly expressed,
          And it seemed that the Snark had begun,
     And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed
          What the pig was supposed to have done.

     The Jury had each formed a different view
          (Long before the indictment was read),
     And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew
          One word that the others had said.

     "You must know--" said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed "Fudge!"
          That statute is obsolete quite!
     Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends
          On an ancient manorial right.

     "In the matter of Treason the pig would appear
          To have aided, but scarcely abetted:
     While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,
          If you grant the plea 'never indebted.'

     "The fact of Desertion I will not dispute;
          But its guilt, as I trust, is removed
     (So far as related to the costs of this suit)
          By the Alibi which has been proved.

     "My poor client's fate now depends on your votes."
          Here the speaker sat down in his place,
     And directed the Judge to refer to his notes
          And briefly to sum up the case.

     But the Judge said he never had summed up before;
          So the Snark undertook it instead,
     And summed it so well that it came to far more
          Than the Witnesses ever had said!

     When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,
          As the word was so puzzling to spell;
     But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind
          Undertaking that duty as well.

     So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,
          It was spent with the toils of the day:
     When it said the word "GUILTY!" the Jury all groaned,
          And some of them fainted away.

     Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite
          Too nervous to utter a word:
     When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,
          And the fall of a pin might be heard.

     "Transportation for life" was the sentence it gave,
          "And _then_ to be fined forty pound."
     The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared
          That the phrase was not legally sound.

     But their wild exultation was suddenly checked
          When the jailer informed them, with tears,
     Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,
          As the pig had been dead for some years.

     The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:
          But the Snark, though a little aghast,
     As the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted,
          Went bellowing on to the last.

     Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed
          To grow every moment more clear:
     Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,
          Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.



                     Fit the Seventh

                    THE BANKER'S FATE


     They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
          They pursued it with forks and hope;
     They threatened its life with a railway-share;
          They charmed it with smiles and soap.

     And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new
          It was matter for general remark,
     Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view
          In his zeal to discover the Snark

     But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,
          A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh
     And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,
          For he knew it was useless to fly.

     He offered large discount--he offered a cheque
          (Drawn "to bearer") for seven-pounds-ten:
     But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck
          And grabbed at the Banker again.

     Without rest or pause--while those frumious jaws
          Went savagely snapping around--
     He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,
          Till fainting he fell to the ground.

     The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared
          Led on by that fear-stricken yell:
     And the Bellman remarked "It is just as I feared!"
          And solemnly tolled on his bell.

     He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace
          The least likeness to what he had been:
     While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white--
          A wonderful thing to be seen!

     To the horror of all who were present that day.
          He uprose in full evening dress,
     And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say
          What his tongue could no longer express.

     Down he sank in a chair--ran his hands through his hair--
          And chanted in mimsiest tones
     Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,
          While he rattled a couple of bones.

     "Leave him here to his fate--it is getting so late!"
          The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.
     "We have lost half the day.  Any further delay,
          And we sha'nt catch a Snark before night!"



                      Fit the Eighth

                      THE VANISHING


     They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;
          They pursued it with forks and hope;
     They threatened its life with a railway-share;
          They charmed it with smiles and soap.

     They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,
          And the Beaver, excited at last,
     Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,
          For the daylight was nearly past.

     "There is Thingumbob shouting!" the Bellman said,
          "He is shouting like mad, only hark!
     He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,
          He has certainly found a Snark!"

     They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed
          "He was always a desperate wag!"
     They beheld him--their Baker--their hero unnamed--
          On the top of a neighboring crag.

     Erect and sublime, for one moment of time.
          In the next, that wild figure they saw
     (As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,
          While they waited and listened in awe.

     "It's a Snark!" was the sound that first came to their ears,
          And seemed almost too good to be true.
     Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:
          Then the ominous words "It's a Boo-"

     Then, silence.  Some fancied they heard in the air
          A weary and wandering sigh
     Then sounded like "-jum!" but the others declare
          It was only a breeze that went by.

     They hunted till darkness came on, but they found
          Not a button, or feather, or mark,
     By which they could tell that they stood on the ground
          Where the Baker had met with the Snark.

     In the midst of the word he was trying to say,
          In the midst of his laughter and glee,
     He had softly and suddenly vanished away---
          For the Snark _was_ a Boojum, you see.

PREFACE.


Nearly the whole of this volume is a reprint of the serious portion of
_Phantasmagoria and other Poems_, which was first published in 1869 and
has long been out of print. "The Path of Roses" was written soon after the
Crimean War, when the name of Florence Nightingale had already become a
household-word. "Only a Woman's Hair" was suggested by a circumstance
mentioned in _The Life of Dean Swift_, viz., that, after his death, a
small packet was found among his papers, containing a single lock of hair
and inscribed with those words. "After Three Days" was written after
seeing Holman Hunt's picture, _The Finding of Christ in the Temple_.

The two poems, "Far Away" and "A Song of Love", are reprinted from _Sylvie
and Bruno_ and _Sylvie and Bruno Concluded_, books whose high price (made
necessary by the great cost of production) has, I fear, put them out of
the reach of most of my readers. "A Lesson in Latin" is reprinted from
_The Jabberwock_, a Magazine got up among the Members of "The Girls' Latin
School, Boston, U.S.A." The only poems, here printed for the first time,
are put together under the title of "Puck Lost and Found," having been
inscribed in two books--_Fairies_, a poem by Allingham, illustrated by
Miss E. Gertrude Thomson, and _Merry Elves_, a story-book, by whom written
I do not know, illustrated by C. O. Murray--which were presented to a
little girl and boy, as a sort of memento of a visit paid by them to the
author one day, on which occasion he taught them the pastime--dear to the
hearts of children--of folding paper-"pistols," which can be made to
imitate, fairly well, the noise of a real one.

THREE SUNSETS.


  He saw her once, and in the glance,
    A moment's glance of meeting eyes,
  His heart stood still in sudden trance:
    He trembled with a sweet surprise--
  All in the waning light she stood,
  The star of perfect womanhood.

  That summer-eve his heart was light:
    With lighter step he trod the ground:
  And life was fairer in his sight,
    And music was in every sound:
  He blessed the world where there could be
  So beautiful a thing as she.

  There once again, as evening fell
    And stars were peering overhead,
  Two lovers met to bid farewell:
    The western sun gleamed faint and red,
  Lost in a drift of purple cloud
  That wrapped him like a funeral-shroud.

  Long time the memory of that night--
    The hand that clasped, the lips that kissed,
  The form that faded from his sight
    Slow sinking through the tearful mist--
  In dreamy music seemed to roll
  Through the dark chambers of his soul.

  So after many years he came
    A wanderer from a distant shore:
  The street, the house, were still the same,
    But those he sought were there no more:
  His burning words, his hopes and fears,
  Unheeded fell on alien ears.

  Only the children from their play
    Would pause the mournful tale to hear,
  Shrinking in half-alarm away,
    Or, step by step, would venture near
  To touch with timid curious hands
  That strange wild man from other lands.

  He sat beside the busy street,
    There, where he last had seen her face:
  And thronging memories, bitter-sweet,
    Seemed yet to haunt the ancient place:
  Her footfall ever floated near:
  Her voice was ever in his ear.

  He sometimes, as the daylight waned
    And evening mists began to roll,
  In half-soliloquy complained
    Of that black shadow on his soul,
  And blindly fanned, with cruel care,
  The ashes of a vain despair.

  The summer fled: the lonely man
    Still lingered out the lessening days;
  Still, as the night drew on, would scan
    Each passing face with closer gaze--
  Till, sick at heart, he turned away,
  And sighed "she will not come to-day."

  So by degrees his spirit bent
    To mock its own despairing cry,
  In stern self-torture to invent
    New luxuries of agony,
  And people all the vacant space
  With visions of her perfect face.

  Then for a moment she was nigh,
    He heard no step, but she was there;
  As if an angel suddenly
    Were bodied from the viewless air,
  And all her fine ethereal frame
  Should fade as swiftly as it came.

  So, half in fancy's sunny trance,
    And half in misery's aching void
  With set and stony countenance
    His bitter being he enjoyed,
  And thrust for ever from his mind
  The happiness he could not find.

  As when the wretch, in lonely room,
    To selfish death is madly hurled,
  The glamour of that fatal fume
    Shuts out the wholesome living world--
  So all his manhood's strength and pride
  One sickly dream had swept aside.

  Yea, brother, and we passed him there,
    But yesterday, in merry mood,
  And marveled at the lordly air
    That shamed his beggar's attitude,
  Nor heeded that ourselves might be
  Wretches as desperate as he;

  Who let the thought of bliss denied
    Make havoc of our life and powers,
  And pine, in solitary pride,
    For peace that never shall be ours,
  Because we will not work and wait
  In trustful patience for our fate.

  And so it chanced once more that she
    Came by the old familiar spot:
  The face he would have died to see
    Bent o'er him, and he knew it not;
  Too rapt in selfish grief to hear,
  Even when happiness was near.

  And pity filled her gentle breast
    For him that would not stir nor speak
  The dying crimson of the west,
    That faintly tinged his haggard cheek,
  Fell on her as she stood, and shed
  A glory round the patient head.

  Ah, let him wake! The moments fly:
    This awful tryst may be the last.
  And see, the tear, that dimmed her eye,
    Had fallen on him ere she passed--
  She passed: the crimson paled to gray:
  And hope departed with the day.

  The heavy hours of night went by,
    And silence quickened into sound,
  And light slid up the eastern sky,
    And life began its daily round--
  But light and life for him were fled:
  His name was numbered with the dead.

THE PATH OF ROSES.


  In the dark silence of an ancient room,
  Whose one tall window fronted to the West,
  Where, through laced tendrils of a hanging vine,
  The sunset-glow was fading into night,
  Sat a pale Lady, resting weary hands
  Upon a great clasped volume, and her face
  Within her hands. Not as in rest she bowed,
  But large hot tears were coursing down her cheek,
  And her low-panted sobs broke awefully
  Upon the sleeping echoes of the night.
    Soon she unclasp'd the volume once again,
  And read the words in tone of agony,
  As in self-torture, weeping as she read:--

  _"He crowns the glory of his race:
  He prayeth but in some fit place
  To meet his foeman face to face:

  "And, battling for the True, the Right,
  From ruddy dawn to purple night,
  To perish in the midmost fight:

  "Where hearts are fierce and hands are strong,
  Where peals the bugle loud and long,
  Where blood is dropping in the throng:

  "Still, with a dim and glazing eye,
  To watch the tide of victory,
  To hear in death the battle-cry:

  "Then, gathered grandly to his grave,
  To rest among the true and brave,
  In holy ground, where yew-trees wave:

  "Where, from church-windows sculptured fair,
  Float out upon the evening air
  The note of praise, the voice of prayer:

  "Where no vain marble mockery
  Insults with loud and boastful lie
  The simple soldier's memory:

  "Where sometimes little children go,
  And read, in whisper'd accent slow,
  The name of him who sleeps below."_

  Her voice died out: like one in dreams she sat.
  "Alas!" she sighed. "For what can Woman do?
  Her life is aimless, and her death unknown:
  Hemmed in by social forms she pines in vain.
  Man has his work, but what can Woman do?"
    And answer came there from the creeping gloom,
  The creeping gloom that settled into night:
  "Peace! For thy lot is other than a man's:
  His is a path of thorns: he beats them down:
  He faces death: he wrestles with despair.
  Thine is of roses, to adorn and cheer
  His lonely life, and hide the thorns in flowers."
    She spake again: in bitter tone she spake:
  "Aye, as a toy, the puppet of an hour,
  Or a fair posy, newly plucked at morn,
  But flung aside and withered ere the night."
    And answer came there from the creeping gloom,
  The creeping gloom that blackened into night:
  "So shalt thou be the lamp to light his path,
  What time the shades of sorrow close around."
    And, so it seemed to her, an awful light
  Pierced slowly through the darkness, orbed, and grew,
  Until all passed away--the ancient room--
  The sunlight dying through the trellised vine--
  The one tall window--all had passed away,
  And she was standing on the mighty hills.
    Beneath, around, and far as eye could see,
  Squadron on squadron, stretched opposing hosts,
  Ranked as for battle, mute and motionless.
  Anon a distant thunder shook the ground,
  The tramp of horses, and a troop shot by--
  Plunged headlong in that living sea of men--
  Plunged to their death: back from that fatal field
  A scattered handful, fighting hard for life,
  Broke through the serried lines; but, as she gazed,
  They shrank and melted, and their forms grew thin--
  Grew pale as ghosts when the first morning ray
  Dawns from the East--the trumpet's brazen blare
  Died into silence--and the vision passed--
  Passed to a room where sick and dying lay
  In long, sad line--there brooded Fear and Pain--
  Darkness was there, the shade of Azrael's wing.
  But there was one that ever, to and fro,
  Moved with light footfall: purely calm her face,
  And those deep steadfast eyes that starred the gloom:
  Still, as she went, she ministered to each
  Comfort and counsel; cooled the fevered brow
  With softest touch, and in the listening ear
  Of the pale sufferer whispered words of peace.
  The dying warrior, gazing as she passed,
  Clasped his thin hands and blessed her. Bless her too,
  Thou, who didst bless the merciful of old!
    So prayed the Lady, watching tearfully
  Her gentle moving onward, till the night
  Had veiled her wholly, and the vision passed.
    Then once again the solemn whisper came:
  "So in the darkest path of man's despair,
  Where War and Terror shake the troubled earth,
  Lies woman's mission; with unblenching brow
  To pass through scenes of horror and affright
  Where men grow sick and tremble: unto her
  All things are sanctified, for all are good.
  Nothing so mean, but shall deserve her care:
  Nothing so great, but she may bear her part.
  No life is vain: each hath his place assigned:
  Do thou thy task, and leave the rest to God."
  And there was silence, but the Lady made
  No answer, save one deeply-breathed "Amen."
    And she arose, and in that darkening room
  Stood lonely as a spirit of the night--
  Stood calm and fearless in the gathered night--
  And raised her eyes to heaven. There were tears
  Upon her face, but in her heart was peace,
  Peace that the world nor gives nor takes away!

THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH.


  Hark, _said the dying man_, _and sighed_,
      To that complaining tone--
  Like sprite condemned, each eventide,
      To walk the world alone.
  At sunset, when the air is still,
  I hear it creep from yonder hill:
  It breathes upon me, dead and chill,
      A moment, and is gone.

  My son, it minds me of a day
      Left half a life behind,
  That I have prayed to put away
      For ever from my mind.
  But bitter memory will not die:
  It haunts my soul when none is nigh:
  I hear its whisper in the sigh
      Of that complaining wind.

  And now in death my soul is fain
      To tell the tale of fear
  That hidden in my breast hath lain
      Through many a weary year:
  Yet time would fail to utter all--
  The evil spells that held me thrall,
  And thrust my life from fall to fall,
      Thou needest not to hear.

  The spells that bound me with a chain,
      Sin's stern behests to do,
  Till Pleasure's self, invoked in vain,
      A heavy burden grew--
  Till from my spirit's fevered eye,
  A hunted thing, I seemed to fly
  Through the dark woods that underlie
      Yon mountain-range of blue.

  Deep in those woods I found a vale
      No sunlight visiteth,
  Nor star, nor wandering moonbeam pale;
      Where never comes the breath
  Of summer-breeze--there in mine ear,
  Even as I lingered half in fear,
  I heard a whisper, cold and clear,
      "This is the gate of Death.

  "O bitter is it to abide
      In weariness alway:
  At dawn to sigh for eventide,
      At eventide for day.
  Thy noon hath fled: thy sun hath shone.
  The brightness of thy day is gone:
  What need to lag and linger on
      Till life be cold and gray?

  "O well," it said, "beneath yon pool,
      In some still cavern deep,
  The fevered brain might slumber cool,
      The eyes forget to weep:
  Within that goblet's mystic rim
  Are draughts of healing, stored for him
  Whose heart is sick, whose sight is dim,
      Who prayeth but to sleep!"

  The evening-breeze went moaning by,
      Like mourner for the dead,
  And stirred, with shrill complaining sigh,
      The tree-tops overhead:
  My guardian-angel seemed to stand
  And mutely wave a warning hand--
  With sudden terror all unmanned,
      I turned myself and fled!

  A cottage-gate stood open wide:
      Soft fell the dying ray
  On two fair children, side by side,
      That rested from their play--
  Together bent the earnest head,
  As ever and anon they read
  From one dear Book: the words they said
      Come back to me to-day.

  Like twin cascades on mountain-stair
      Together wandered down
  The ripples of the golden hair,
      The ripples of the brown:
  While, through the tangled silken haze,
  Blue eyes looked forth in eager gaze,
  More starlike than the gems that blaze
      About a monarch's crown.

  My son, there comes to each an hour
      When sinks the spirit's pride--
  When weary hands forget their power
      The strokes of death to guide:
  In such a moment, warriors say,
  A word the panic-rout may stay,
  A sudden charge redeem the day
      And turn the living tide.

  I could not see, for blinding tears,
      The glories of the west:
  A heavenly music filled mine ears,
      A heavenly peace my breast.
  "Come unto Me, come unto Me--
  All ye that labour, unto Me--
  Ye heavy-laden, come to Me--
      And I will give you rest."

  The night drew onward: thin and blue
      The evening mists arise
  To bathe the thirsty land in dew,
      As erst in Paradise--
  While, over silent field and town,
  The deep blue vault of heaven looked down;
  Not, as of old, in angry frown,
      But bright with angels' eyes.

  Blest day! Then first I heard the voice
      That since hath oft beguiled
  These eyes from tears, and bid rejoice
      This heart with anguish wild--
  Thy mother, boy, thou hast not known;
  So soon she left me here to moan--
  Left me to weep and watch, alone,
      Our one beloved child.

  Though, parted from my aching sight,
      Like homeward-speeding dove,
  She passed into the perfect light
      That floods the world above;
  Yet our twin spirits, well I know--
  Though one abide in pain below--
  Love, as in summers long ago,
      And evermore shall love.

  So with a glad and patient heart
      I move toward mine end:
  The streams, that flow awhile apart,
      Shall both in ocean blend.
  I dare not weep: I can but bless
  The Love that pitied my distress,
  And lent me, in Life's wilderness,
      So sweet and true a friend.

  But if there be--O if there be
      A truth in what they say,
  That angel-forms we cannot see
      Go with us on our way;
  Then surely she is with me here,
  I dimly feel her spirit near--
  The morning-mists grow thin and clear,
      And Death brings in the Day.

SOLITUDE.


  I love the stillness of the wood:
    I love the music of the rill:
  I love to couch in pensive mood
        Upon some silent hill.

  Scarce heard, beneath yon arching trees,
    The silver-crested ripples pass;
  And, like a mimic brook, the breeze
        Whispers among the grass.

  Here from the world I win release,
    Nor scorn of men, nor footstep rude,
  Break in to mar the holy peace
        Of this great solitude.

  Here may the silent tears I weep
    Lull the vexed spirit into rest,
  As infants sob themselves to sleep
        Upon a mother's breast.

  But when the bitter hour is gone,
    And the keen throbbing pangs are still,
  Oh sweetest then to couch alone
        Upon some silent hill!

  To live in joys that once have been,
    To put the cold world out of sight,
  And deck life's drear and barren scene
        With hues of rainbow-light.

  For what to man the gift of breath,
    If sorrow be his lot below;
  If all the day that ends in death
        Be dark with clouds of woe?

  Shall the poor transport of an hour
    Repay long years of sore distress--
  The fragrance of a lonely flower
        Make glad the wilderness?

  Ye golden hours of Life's young spring,
    Of innocence, of love and truth!
  Bright, beyond all imagining,
        Thou fairy-dream of youth!

  I'd give all wealth that years have piled,
    The slow result of Life's decay,
  To be once more a little child
        For one bright summer-day.

_March 16, 1853._




FAR AWAY.


  He stept so lightly to the land,
      All in his manly pride:
  He kissed her cheek, he clasped her hand;
      Yet still she glanced aside.
  "Too gay he seems," she darkly dreams,
      "Too gallant and too gay,
  To think of me--poor simple me--
      When he is far away!"

  "I bring my Love this goodly pearl
      Across the seas," he said:
  "A gem to deck the dearest girl
      That ever sailor wed!"
  She holds it tight: her eyes are bright:
      Her throbbing heart would say
  "He thought of me--he thought of me--
      When he was far away!"

  The ship has sailed into the West:
      Her ocean-bird is flown:
  A dull dead pain is in her breast,
      And she is weak and lone:
  But there's a smile upon her face,
      A smile that seems to say
  "He'll think of me--he'll think of me--
      When he is far away!

  "Though waters wide between us glide,
      Our lives are warm and near:
  No distance parts two faithful hearts--
      Two hearts that love so dear:
  And I will trust my sailor-lad,
      For ever and a day,
  To think of me--to think of me--
      When he is far away!"


[Illustration]




BEATRICE.


  In her eyes is the living light
    Of a wanderer to earth
  From a far celestial height:
      Summers five are all the span--
      Summers five since Time began
  To veil in mists of human night
    A shining angel-birth.

  Does an angel look from her eyes?
    Will she suddenly spring away,
  And soar to her home in the skies?
      Beatrice! Blessing and blessed to be!
      Beatrice! Still, as I gaze on thee,
  Visions of two sweet maids arise,
    Whose life was of yesterday:

  Of a Beatrice pale and stern,
    With the lips of a dumb despair,
  With the innocent eyes that yearn--
      Yearn for the young sweet hours of life,
      Far from sorrow and far from strife,
  For the happy summers, that never return,
    When the world seemed good and fair:

  Of a Beatrice glorious, bright--
    Of a sainted, ethereal maid,
  Whose blue eyes are deep fountains of light,
      Cheering the poet that broodeth apart,
      Filling with gladness his desolate heart,
  Like the moon when she shines thro' a cloudless night
    On a world of silence and shade.

  And the visions waver and faint,
    And the visions vanish away
  That my fancy delighted to paint--
      She is here at my side, a living child,
      With the glowing cheek and the tresses wild,
  Nor death-pale martyr, nor radiant saint,
    Yet stainless and bright as they.

  For I think, if a grim wild beast
    Were to come from his charnel-cave,
  From his jungle-home in the East--
      Stealthily creeping with bated breath,
      Stealthily creeping with eyes of death--
  He would all forget his dream of the feast,
    And crouch at her feet a slave.

  She would twine her hand in his mane:
    She would prattle in silvery tone,
  Like the tinkle of summer-rain--
      Questioning him with her laughing eyes,
      Questioning him with a glad surprise,
  Till she caught from those fierce eyes again
    The love that lit her own.

  And be sure, if a savage heart,
    In a mask of human guise,
  Were to come on her here apart--
      Bound for a dark and a deadly deed,
      Hurrying past with pitiless speed--
  He would suddenly falter and guiltily start
    At the glance of her pure blue eyes.

  Nay, be sure, if an angel fair,
    A bright seraph undefiled,
  Were to stoop from the trackless air,
      Fain would she linger in glad amaze--
      Lovingly linger to ponder and gaze,
  With a sister's love and a sister's care,
    On the happy, innocent child.

STOLEN WATERS.


  The light was faint, and soft the air
        That breathed around the place;
  And she was lithe, and tall, and fair,
        And with a wayward grace
        Her queenly head she bare.

  With glowing cheek, with gleaming eye,
        She met me on the way:
  My spirit owned the witchery
        Within her smile that lay:
  I followed her, I knew not why.

  The trees were thick with many a fruit,
        The grass with many a flower:
  My soul was dead, my tongue was mute,
        In that accursëd hour.

  And, in my dream, with silvery voice,
        She said, or seemed to say,
  "Youth is the season to rejoice--"
        I could not choose but stay:
        I could not say her nay.

  She plucked a branch above her head,
        With rarest fruitage laden:
  "Drink of the juice, Sir Knight," she said:
        "'Tis good for knight and maiden."

  Oh, blind mine eye that would not trace--
    Oh, deaf mine ear that would not heed--
  The mocking smile upon her face,
        The mocking voice of greed!

  I drank the juice; and straightway felt
        A fire within my brain:
  My soul within me seemed to melt
        In sweet delirious pain.

  "Sweet is the stolen draught," she said:
        "Hath sweetness stint or measure?
  Pleasant the secret hoard of bread:
        What bars us from our pleasure?"

  "Yea, take we pleasure while we may,"
        I heard myself replying.
  In the red sunset, far away,
        My happier life was dying:
  My heart was sad, my voice was gay.

  And unawares, I knew not how,
    I kissed her dainty finger-tips,
  I kissed her on the lily brow,
    I kissed her on the false, false lips--
  That burning kiss, I feel it now!

  "True love gives true love of the best:
    Then take," I cried, "my heart to thee!"
  The very heart from out my breast
    I plucked, I gave it willingly:
    Her very heart she gave to me--
  Then died the glory from the west.

  In the gray light I saw her face,
    And it was withered, old, and gray;
  The flowers were fading in their place,
    Were fading with the fading day.

  Forth from her, like a hunted deer,
    Through all that ghastly night I fled,
  And still behind me seemed to hear
        Her fierce unflagging tread;
  And scarce drew breath for fear.

  Yet marked I well how strangely seemed
    The heart within my breast to sleep:
  Silent it lay, or so I dreamed,
        With never a throb or leap.

  For hers was now my heart, she said,
    The heart that once had been mine own:
  And in my breast I bore instead
        A cold, cold heart of stone.
  So grew the morning overhead.

  The sun shot downward through the trees
        His old familiar flame:
  All ancient sounds upon the breeze
        From copse and meadow came--
        But I was not the same.

  They call me mad: I smile, I weep,
        Uncaring how or why:
  Yea, when one's heart is laid asleep,
        What better than to die?
  So that the grave be dark and deep.

  To die! To die? And yet, methinks,
        I drink of life, to-day,
  Deep as the thirsty traveler drinks
        Of fountain by the way:
  My voice is sad, my heart is gay.

  When yestereve was on the wane,
        I heard a clear voice singing
  So sweetly that, like summer-rain,
        My happy tears came springing:
  My human heart returned again.

        _"A rosy child,
  Sitting and singing, in a garden fair,
      The joy of hearing, seeing,
      The simple joy of being--
  Or twining rosebuds in the golden hair
      That ripples free and wild.

        "A sweet pale child--
  Wearily looking to the purple West--
      Waiting the great For-ever
      That suddenly shall sever
  The cruel chains that hold her from her rest--
      By earth-joys unbeguiled.

        "An angel-child--
  Gazing with living eyes on a dead face:
      The mortal form forsaken,
      That none may now awaken,
  That lieth painless, moveless in her place,
      As though in death she smiled!

        "Be as a child--
  So shalt thou sing for very joy of breath--
      So shalt thou wait thy dying,
      In holy transport lying--
  So pass rejoicing through the gate of death,
      In garment undefiled."_

  Then call me what they will, I know
        That now my soul is glad:
  If this be madness, better so,
        Far better to be mad,
  Weeping or smiling as I go.

  For if I weep, it is that now
    I see how deep a loss is mine,
  And feel how brightly round my brow
        The coronal might shine,
  Had I but kept mine early vow:

  And if I smile, it is that now
    I see the promise of the years--
  The garland waiting for my brow,
        That must be won with tears,
  With pain--with death--I care not how.

THE WILLOW-TREE.


  The morn was bright, the steeds were light,
      The wedding guests were gay:
  Young Ellen stood within the wood
      And watched them pass away.
  She scarcely saw the gallant train:
      The tear-drop dimmed her ee:
  Unheard the maiden did complain
      Beneath the Willow-Tree.

  "Oh Robin, thou didst love me well,
      Till, on a bitter day,
  She came, the Lady Isabel,
      And stole thy heart away.
  My tears are vain: I live again
      In days that used to be,
  When I could meet thy welcome feet
      Beneath the Willow-Tree.

  "Oh Willow gray, I may not stay
      Till Spring renew thy leaf;
  But I will hide myself away,
      And nurse a lonely grief.
  It shall not dim Life's joy for him:
      My tears he shall not see:
  While he is by, I'll come not nigh
      My weeping Willow-Tree.

  "But when I die, oh let me lie
      Beneath thy loving shade,
  That he may loiter careless by,
      Where I am lowly laid.
  And let the white white marble tell,
      If he should stoop to see,
  'Here lies a maid that loved thee well,
      Beneath the Willow-Tree.'"

1859.




ONLY A WOMAN'S HAIR.


  'Only a woman's hair'! Fling it aside!
    A bubble on Life's mighty stream:
  Heed it not, man, but watch the broadening tide
        Bright with the western beam.

  Nay! In those words there rings from other years
    The echo of a long low cry,
  Where a proud spirit wrestles with its tears
        In loneliest agony.

  And, as I touch that lock, strange visions throng
    Upon my soul with dreamy grace--
  Of woman's hair, the theme of poet's song
        In every time and place.

  A child's bright tresses, by the breezes kissed
    To sweet disorder as she flies,
  Veiling, beneath a cloud of golden mist,
        Flushed cheek and laughing eyes--

  Or fringing, like a shadow, raven-black,
    The glory of a queen-like face--
  Or from a gipsy's sunny brow tossed back
        In wild and wanton grace--

  Or crown-like on the hoary head of Age,
    Whose tale of life is well-nigh told--
  Or, last, in dreams I make my pilgrimage
        To Bethany of old.

  I see the feast--the purple and the gold--
    The gathering crowd of Pharisees,
  Whose scornful eyes are centred to behold
        Yon woman on her knees.

  The stifled sob rings strangely on mine ears,
    Wrung from the depth of sin's despair:
  And still she bathes the sacred feet with tears,
        And wipes them with her hair.

  He scorned not then the simple loving deed
    Of her, the lowest and the last;
  Then scorn not thou, but use with earnest heed
        This relic of the past.

  The eyes that loved it once no longer wake:
    So lay it by with reverent care--
  Touching it tenderly for sorrow's sake--
        It is a woman's hair.

THE SAILOR'S WIFE.


  See! There are tears upon her face--
    Tears newly shed, and scarcely dried:
  Close, in an agonised embrace,
    She clasps the infant at her side.

  Peace dwells in those soft-lidded eyes,
    Those parted lips that faintly smile--
  Peace, the foretaste of Paradise,
    In heart too young for care or guile.

  No peace that mother's features wear;
    But quivering lip, and knotted brow,
  And broken mutterings, all declare
    The fearful dream that haunts her now.

  The storm-wind, rushing through the sky,
    Wails from the depths of cloudy space;
  Shrill, piercing as the seaman's cry
    When death and he are face to face.

  Familiar tones are in the gale:
    They ring upon her startled ear:
  And quick and low she pants the tale
    That tells of agony and fear:

  "Still that phantom-ship is nigh--
    With a vexed and life-like motion,
  All beneath an angry sky,
    Rocking on an angry ocean.

  "Round the straining mast and shrouds
    Throng the spirits of the storm:
  Darkly seen through driving clouds,
    Bends each gaunt and ghastly form.

  "See! The good ship yields at last!
    Dumbly yields, and fights no more;
  Driving, in the frantic blast,
    Headlong on the fatal shore.

  "Hark! I hear her battered side,
    With a low and sullen shock,
  Dashed, amid the foaming tide,
    Full upon a sunken rock.

  "His face shines out against the sky,
    Like a ghost, so cold and white;
  With a dead despairing eye
    Gazing through the gathered night.

  "Is he watching, through the dark
    Where a mocking ghostly hand
  Points a faint and feeble spark
    Glimmering from the distant land?

  "Sees he, in this hour of dread,
    Hearth and home and wife and child?
  Loved ones who, in summers fled,
    Clung to him and wept and smiled?

  "Reeling sinks the fated bark
    To her tomb beneath the wave:
  Must he perish in the dark--
    Not a hand stretched out to save?

  "See the spirits, how they crowd!
    Watching death with eyes that burn!
  Waves rush in----" she shrieks aloud,
    Ere her waking sense return.

  The storm is gone: the skies are clear:
    Hush'd is that bitter cry of pain:
  The only sound, that meets her ear,
    The heaving of the sullen main.

  Though heaviness endure the night,
    Yet joy shall come with break of day:
  She shudders with a strange delight--
    The fearful dream is pass'd away.

  She wakes: the grey dawn streaks the dark:
    With early song the copses ring:
  Far off she hears the watch-dog bark
    A joyful bark of welcoming!

AFTER THREE DAYS.


      I stood within the gate
  Of a great temple, 'mid the living stream
  Of worshipers that thronged its regal state
      Fair-pictured in my dream.

      Jewels and gold were there;
  And floors of marble lent a crystal sheen
  To body forth, as in a lower air,
      The wonders of the scene.

      Such wild and lavish grace
  Had whispers in it of a coming doom;
  As richest flowers lie strown about the face
      Of her that waits the tomb.

      The wisest of the land
  Had gathered there, three solemn trysting-days,
  For high debate: men stood on either hand
      To listen and to gaze.

      The aged brows were bent,
  Bent to a frown, half thought, and half annoy,
  That all their stores of subtlest argument
      Were baffled by a boy.

      In each averted face
  I marked but scorn and loathing, till mine eyes
  Fell upon one that stirred not in his place,
      Tranced in a dumb surprise.

      Surely within his mind
  Strange thoughts are born, until he doubts the lore
  Of those old men, blind leaders of the blind,
      Whose kingdom is no more.

      Surely he sees afar
  A day of death the stormy future brings;
  The crimson setting of the herald-star
      That led the Eastern kings.

      Thus, as a sunless deep
  Mirrors the shining heights that crown the bay,
  So did my soul create anew in sleep
      The picture seen by day.

      Gazers came and went--
  A restless hum of voices marked the spot--
  In varying shades of critic discontent
      Prating they knew not what.

      "Where is the comely limb,
  The form attuned in every perfect part,
  The beauty that we should desire in him?"
      Ah! Fools and slow of heart!

      Look into those deep eyes,
  Deep as the grave, and strong with love divine;
  Those tender, pure, and fathomless mysteries,
      That seem to pierce through thine.

      Look into those deep eyes,
  Stirred to unrest by breath of coming strife,
  Until a longing in thy soul arise
      That this indeed were life:

      That thou couldst find Him there,
  Bend at His sacred feet thy willing knee,
  And from thy heart pour out the passionate prayer
      "Lord, let me follow Thee!"

      But see the crowd divide:
  Mother and sire have found their lost one now:
  The gentle voice, that fain would seem to chide
      Whispers "Son, why hast thou"--

      In tone of sad amaze--
  "Thus dealt with us, that art our dearest thing?
  Behold, thy sire and I, three weary days,
      Have sought thee sorrowing."

      And I had stayed to hear
  The loving words "How is it that ye sought?"--
  But that the sudden lark, with matins clear,
      Severed the links of thought.

      Then over all there fell
  Shadow and silence; and my dream was fled,
  As fade the phantoms of a wizard's cell
      When the dark charm is said.

      Yet, in the gathering light,
  I lay with half-shut eyes that would not wake,
  Lovingly clinging to the skirts of night
      For that sweet vision's sake.

FACES IN THE FIRE.


  The night creeps onward, sad and slow:
  In these red embers' dying glow
  The forms of Fancy come and go.

  An island-farm--broad seas of corn
  Stirred by the wandering breath of morn--
  The happy spot where I was born.

  The picture fadeth in its place:
  Amid the glow I seem to trace
  The shifting semblance of a face.

  'Tis now a little childish form--
  Red lips for kisses pouted warm--
  And elf-locks tangled in the storm.

  'Tis now a grave and gentle maid,
  At her own beauty half afraid,
  Shrinking, and willing to be stayed.

  Oh, Time was young, and Life was warm,
  When first I saw that fairy-form,
  Her dark hair tossing in the storm.

  And fast and free these pulses played,
  When last I met that gentle maid--
  When last her hand in mine was laid.

  Those locks of jet are turned to gray,
  And she is strange and far away
  That might have been mine own to-day--

  That might have been mine own, my dear,
  Through many and many a happy year--
  That might have sat beside me here.

  Ay, changeless through the changing scene,
  The ghostly whisper rings between,
  The dark refrain of 'might have been.'

  The race is o'er I might have run:
  The deeds are past I might have done;
  And sere the wreath I might have won.

  Sunk is the last faint flickering blaze:
  The vision of departed days
  Is vanished even as I gaze.

  The pictures, with their ruddy light,
  Are changed to dust and ashes white,
  And I am left alone with night.

A LESSON IN LATIN.


  Our Latin books, in motley row,
      Invite us to our task--
  Gay Horace, stately Cicero:
  Yet there's one verb, when once we know,
      No higher skill we ask:
  This ranks all other lore above--
  We've learned "'_Amare_' means '_to love_'!"

  So, hour by hour, from flower to flower,
      We sip the sweets of Life:
  Till, all too soon, the clouds arise,
  And flaming cheeks and flashing eyes
      Proclaim the dawn of strife:
  With half a smile and half a sigh,
  "_Amare! Bitter One!_" we cry.

  Last night we owned, with looks forlorn,
      "Too well the scholar knows
  There is no rose without a thorn"--
  But peace is made! We sing, this morn,
      "No thorn without a rose!"
  Our Latin lesson is complete:
  We've learned that Love is Bitter-Sweet!

_May, 1888._




PUCK LOST AND FOUND.


  Puck has fled the haunts of men:
    Ridicule has made him wary:
  In the woods, and down the glen,
        No one meets a Fairy!

  "Cream!" the greedy Goblin cries--
    Empties the deserted dairy--
  Steals the spoons, and off he flies.
        Still we seek our Fairy!

  Ah! What form is entering?
    Lovelit eyes and laughter airy!
  Is not this a better thing,
  Child, whose visit thus I sing,
        Even than a Fairy?

_Nov. 22, 1891._

  Puck has ventured back agen:
    Ridicule no more affrights him:
  In the very haunts of men
        Newer sport delights him.

  Capering lightly to and fro,
    Ever frolicking and funning--
  "Crack!" the mimic pistols go!
        Hark! The noise is stunning!

  All too soon will Childhood gay
    Realise Life's sober sadness.
  Let's be merry while we may,
  Innocent and happy Fay!
        Elves were made for gladness!

A SONG OF LOVE.


  Say, what is the spell, when her fledgelings are cheeping,
        That lures the bird home to her nest?
  Or wakes the tired mother, whose infant is weeping,
        To cuddle and croon it to rest?
  What the magic that charms the glad babe in her arms,
        Till it cooes with the voice of the dove?
  'Tis a secret, and so let us whisper it low--
        And the name of the secret is Love!
              For I think it is Love,
              For I feel it is Love,
        For I'm sure it is nothing but Love!

  Say, whence is the voice that, when anger is burning,
        Bids the whirl of the tempest to cease?
  That stirs the vexed soul with an aching--a yearning
        For the brotherly hand-grip of peace?
  Whence the music that fills all our being--that thrills
        Around us, beneath, and above?
  'Tis a secret: none knows how it comes, how it goes--
        But the name of the secret is Love!
              For I think it is Love,
              For I feel it is Love,
        For I'm sure it is nothing but Love!

  Say, whose is the skill that paints valley and hill,
        Like a picture so fair to the sight?
  That flecks the green meadow with sunshine and shadow,
        Till the little lambs leap with delight?
  'Tis a secret untold to hearts cruel and cold,
        Though 'tis sung, by the angels above,
  In notes that ring clear for the ears that can hear--
        And the name of the secret is Love!
              For I think it is Love,
              For I feel it is Love,
        For I'm sure it is nothing but Love!

THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS

By Lewis Carroll


The Millennium Fulcrum Edition 1.7




CHAPTER I. Looking-Glass house

One thing was certain, that the WHITE kitten had had nothing to do with
it:--it was the black kitten's fault entirely. For the white kitten had
been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of
an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it
COULDN'T have had any hand in the mischief.

The way Dinah washed her children's faces was this: first she held the
poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she
rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and
just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was
lying quite still and trying to purr--no doubt feeling that it was all
meant for its good.

But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon,
and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great
arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been
having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been
trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all
come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all
knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the
middle.

'Oh, you wicked little thing!' cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and
giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace.
'Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You OUGHT,
Dinah, you know you ought!' she added, looking reproachfully at the old
cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage--and then she
scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted
with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn't get on
very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and
sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to
watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one
paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it
might.

'Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?' Alice began. 'You'd have guessed
if you'd been up in the window with me--only Dinah was making you tidy,
so you couldn't. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the
bonfire--and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold, and
it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, we'll go and
see the bonfire to-morrow.' Here Alice wound two or three turns of the
worsted round the kitten's neck, just to see how it would look: this led
to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards
and yards of it got unwound again.

'Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,' Alice went on as soon as they were
comfortably settled again, 'when I saw all the mischief you had been
doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into
the snow! And you'd have deserved it, you little mischievous darling!
What have you got to say for yourself? Now don't interrupt me!' she
went on, holding up one finger. 'I'm going to tell you all your faults.
Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this
morning. Now you can't deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What's that you
say?' (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) 'Her paw went into your
eye? Well, that's YOUR fault, for keeping your eyes open--if you'd
shut them tight up, it wouldn't have happened. Now don't make any more
excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail
just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were
thirsty, were you? How do you know she wasn't thirsty too? Now for
number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn't
looking!

'That's three faults, Kitty, and you've not been punished for any of
them yet. You know I'm saving up all your punishments for Wednesday
week--Suppose they had saved up all MY punishments!' she went on,
talking more to herself than the kitten. 'What WOULD they do at the end
of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came.
Or--let me see--suppose each punishment was to be going without a
dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without
fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn't mind THAT much! I'd far rather
go without them than eat them!

'Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft
it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside.
I wonder if the snow LOVES the trees and fields, that it kisses them so
gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt;
and perhaps it says, "Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes
again." And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress
themselves all in green, and dance about--whenever the wind blows--oh,
that's very pretty!' cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap
her hands. 'And I do so WISH it was true! I'm sure the woods look sleepy
in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.

'Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don't smile, my dear, I'm asking it
seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as
if you understood it: and when I said "Check!" you purred! Well, it WAS
a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn't been for
that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces. Kitty, dear,
let's pretend--' And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice
used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase 'Let's pretend.' She
had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before--all
because Alice had begun with 'Let's pretend we're kings and queens;' and
her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn't,
because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last
to say, 'Well, YOU can be one of them then, and I'LL be all the rest.'
And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in
her ear, 'Nurse! Do let's pretend that I'm a hungry hyaena, and you're a
bone.'

But this is taking us away from Alice's speech to the kitten. 'Let's
pretend that you're the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you
sat up and folded your arms, you'd look exactly like her. Now do try,
there's a dear!' And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it
up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing
didn't succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn't
fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the
Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was--'and if you're not
good directly,' she added, 'I'll put you through into Looking-glass
House. How would you like THAT?'

'Now, if you'll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I'll tell you
all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there's the room you can
see through the glass--that's just the same as our drawing room, only
the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a
chair--all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could
see THAT bit! I want so much to know whether they've a fire in the
winter: you never CAN tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then
smoke comes up in that room too--but that may be only pretence, just to
make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are something
like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because
I've held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in
the other room.

'How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if
they'd give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn't good
to drink--But oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a
little PEEP of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the door
of our drawing-room wide open: and it's very like our passage as far
as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond.
Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into
Looking-glass House! I'm sure it's got, oh! such beautiful things in it!
Let's pretend there's a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty.
Let's pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get
through. Why, it's turning into a sort of mist now, I declare! It'll be
easy enough to get through--' She was up on the chimney-piece while she
said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And certainly
the glass WAS beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.

In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly
down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was
to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite
pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as
the one she had left behind. 'So I shall be as warm here as I was in the
old room,' thought Alice: 'warmer, in fact, because there'll be no one
here to scold me away from the fire. Oh, what fun it'll be, when they
see me through the glass in here, and can't get at me!'

Then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from
the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest
was as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the
wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on
the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the
Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her.

'They don't keep this room so tidy as the other,' Alice thought to
herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among
the cinders: but in another moment, with a little 'Oh!' of surprise, she
was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking
about, two and two!

'Here are the Red King and the Red Queen,' Alice said (in a whisper, for
fear of frightening them), 'and there are the White King and the White
Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel--and here are two castles
walking arm in arm--I don't think they can hear me,' she went on, as she
put her head closer down, 'and I'm nearly sure they can't see me. I feel
somehow as if I were invisible--'

Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her
turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and
begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would
happen next.

'It is the voice of my child!' the White Queen cried out as she rushed
past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders.
'My precious Lily! My imperial kitten!' and she began scrambling wildly
up the side of the fender.

'Imperial fiddlestick!' said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been
hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a LITTLE annoyed with the Queen,
for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.

Alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was
nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and
set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.

The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had
quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing
but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her
breath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting
sulkily among the ashes, 'Mind the volcano!'

'What volcano?' said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if
he thought that was the most likely place to find one.

'Blew--me--up,' panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath.
'Mind you come up--the regular way--don't get blown up!'

Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar,
till at last she said, 'Why, you'll be hours and hours getting to the
table, at that rate. I'd far better help you, hadn't I?' But the King
took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither
hear her nor see her.

So Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly
than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn't take his breath away:
but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust
him a little, he was so covered with ashes.

She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face
as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible
hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but
his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder
and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let
him drop upon the floor.

'Oh! PLEASE don't make such faces, my dear!' she cried out, quite
forgetting that the King couldn't hear her. 'You make me laugh so that
I can hardly hold you! And don't keep your mouth so wide open! All the
ashes will get into it--there, now I think you're tidy enough!' she
added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the
Queen.

The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and
Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room
to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she could
find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she
found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a
frightened whisper--so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said.

The King was saying, 'I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very
ends of my whiskers!'

To which the Queen replied, 'You haven't got any whiskers.'

'The horror of that moment,' the King went on, 'I shall never, NEVER
forget!'

'You will, though,' the Queen said, 'if you don't make a memorandum of
it.'

Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous
memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought
struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some
way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.

The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil
for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him,
and at last he panted out, 'My dear! I really MUST get a thinner pencil.
I can't manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that I
don't intend--'

'What manner of things?' said the Queen, looking over the book (in which
Alice had put 'THE WHITE KNIGHT IS SLIDING DOWN THE POKER. HE BALANCES
VERY BADLY') 'That's not a memorandum of YOUR feelings!'

There was a book lying near Alice on the table, and while she sat
watching the White King (for she was still a little anxious about him,
and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again),
she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read,
'--for it's all in some language I don't know,' she said to herself.

It was like this.


             YKCOWREBBAJ

     sevot yhtils eht dna,gillirb sawT'
      ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg diD
        ,sevogorob eht erew ysmim llA
       .ebargtuo shtar emom eht dnA


She puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck
her. 'Why, it's a Looking-glass book, of course! And if I hold it up to
a glass, the words will all go the right way again.'

This was the poem that Alice read.


             JABBERWOCKY

     'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.

     'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
     Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
      The frumious Bandersnatch!'

     He took his vorpal sword in hand:
      Long time the manxome foe he sought--
     So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
      And stood awhile in thought.

     And as in uffish thought he stood,
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
     Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
      And burbled as it came!

     One, two! One, two! And through and through
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
     He left it dead, and with its head
      He went galumphing back.

     'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
     O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
      He chortled in his joy.

     'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.


'It seems very pretty,' she said when she had finished it, 'but it's
RATHER hard to understand!' (You see she didn't like to confess, even
to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) 'Somehow it seems
to fill my head with ideas--only I don't exactly know what they are!
However, SOMEBODY killed SOMETHING: that's clear, at any rate--'

'But oh!' thought Alice, suddenly jumping up, 'if I don't make haste I
shall have to go back through the Looking-glass, before I've seen what
the rest of the house is like! Let's have a look at the garden first!'
She was out of the room in a moment, and ran down stairs--or, at least,
it wasn't exactly running, but a new invention of hers for getting down
stairs quickly and easily, as Alice said to herself. She just kept the
tips of her fingers on the hand-rail, and floated gently down without
even touching the stairs with her feet; then she floated on through the
hall, and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way, if
she hadn't caught hold of the door-post. She was getting a little giddy
with so much floating in the air, and was rather glad to find herself
walking again in the natural way.




CHAPTER II. The Garden of Live Flowers

'I should see the garden far better,' said Alice to herself, 'if I could
get to the top of that hill: and here's a path that leads straight to
it--at least, no, it doesn't do that--' (after going a few yards along
the path, and turning several sharp corners), 'but I suppose it will
at last. But how curiously it twists! It's more like a corkscrew than a
path! Well, THIS turn goes to the hill, I suppose--no, it doesn't! This
goes straight back to the house! Well then, I'll try it the other way.'

And so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, but
always coming back to the house, do what she would. Indeed, once, when
she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it
before she could stop herself.

'It's no use talking about it,' Alice said, looking up at the house and
pretending it was arguing with her. 'I'm NOT going in again yet. I know
I should have to get through the Looking-glass again--back into the old
room--and there'd be an end of all my adventures!'

So, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more
down the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill.
For a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, 'I really
SHALL do it this time--' when the path gave a sudden twist and shook
itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found
herself actually walking in at the door.

'Oh, it's too bad!' she cried. 'I never saw such a house for getting in
the way! Never!'

However, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be
done but start again. This time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a
border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.

'O Tiger-lily,' said Alice, addressing herself to one that was waving
gracefully about in the wind, 'I WISH you could talk!'

'We CAN talk,' said the Tiger-lily: 'when there's anybody worth talking
to.'

Alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite
seemed to take her breath away. At length, as the Tiger-lily only went
on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice--almost in a whisper.
'And can ALL the flowers talk?'

'As well as YOU can,' said the Tiger-lily. 'And a great deal louder.'

'It isn't manners for us to begin, you know,' said the Rose, 'and I
really was wondering when you'd speak! Said I to myself, "Her face has
got SOME sense in it, though it's not a clever one!" Still, you're the
right colour, and that goes a long way.'

'I don't care about the colour,' the Tiger-lily remarked. 'If only her
petals curled up a little more, she'd be all right.'

Alice didn't like being criticised, so she began asking questions.
'Aren't you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody
to take care of you?'

'There's the tree in the middle,' said the Rose: 'what else is it good
for?'

'But what could it do, if any danger came?' Alice asked.

'It says "Bough-wough!"' cried a Daisy: 'that's why its branches are
called boughs!'

'Didn't you know THAT?' cried another Daisy, and here they all began
shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill
voices. 'Silence, every one of you!' cried the Tiger-lily, waving itself
passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement. 'They
know I can't get at them!' it panted, bending its quivering head towards
Alice, 'or they wouldn't dare to do it!'

'Never mind!' Alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the
daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, 'If you don't
hold your tongues, I'll pick you!'

There was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned
white.

'That's right!' said the Tiger-lily. 'The daisies are worst of all. When
one speaks, they all begin together, and it's enough to make one wither
to hear the way they go on!'

'How is it you can all talk so nicely?' Alice said, hoping to get it
into a better temper by a compliment. 'I've been in many gardens before,
but none of the flowers could talk.'

'Put your hand down, and feel the ground,' said the Tiger-lily. 'Then
you'll know why.'

Alice did so. 'It's very hard,' she said, 'but I don't see what that has
to do with it.'

'In most gardens,' the Tiger-lily said, 'they make the beds too soft--so
that the flowers are always asleep.'

This sounded a very good reason, and Alice was quite pleased to know it.
'I never thought of that before!' she said.

'It's MY opinion that you never think AT ALL,' the Rose said in a rather
severe tone.

'I never saw anybody that looked stupider,' a Violet said, so suddenly,
that Alice quite jumped; for it hadn't spoken before.

'Hold YOUR tongue!' cried the Tiger-lily. 'As if YOU ever saw anybody!
You keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there, till you know
no more what's going on in the world, than if you were a bud!'

'Are there any more people in the garden besides me?' Alice said, not
choosing to notice the Rose's last remark.

'There's one other flower in the garden that can move about like you,'
said the Rose. 'I wonder how you do it--' ('You're always wondering,'
said the Tiger-lily), 'but she's more bushy than you are.'

'Is she like me?' Alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her mind,
'There's another little girl in the garden, somewhere!'

'Well, she has the same awkward shape as you,' the Rose said, 'but she's
redder--and her petals are shorter, I think.'

'Her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,' the Tiger-lily
interrupted: 'not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.'

'But that's not YOUR fault,' the Rose added kindly: 'you're beginning
to fade, you know--and then one can't help one's petals getting a little
untidy.'

Alice didn't like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she asked
'Does she ever come out here?'

'I daresay you'll see her soon,' said the Rose. 'She's one of the thorny
kind.'

'Where does she wear the thorns?' Alice asked with some curiosity.

'Why all round her head, of course,' the Rose replied. 'I was wondering
YOU hadn't got some too. I thought it was the regular rule.'

'She's coming!' cried the Larkspur. 'I hear her footstep, thump, thump,
thump, along the gravel-walk!'

Alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the Red Queen. 'She's
grown a good deal!' was her first remark. She had indeed: when Alice
first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches high--and
here she was, half a head taller than Alice herself!

'It's the fresh air that does it,' said the Rose: 'wonderfully fine air
it is, out here.'

'I think I'll go and meet her,' said Alice, for, though the flowers were
interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk
with a real Queen.

'You can't possibly do that,' said the Rose: '_I_ should advise you to
walk the other way.'

This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off at
once towards the Red Queen. To her surprise, she lost sight of her in a
moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again.

A little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the
queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she
would try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction.

It succeeded beautifully. She had not been walking a minute before she
found herself face to face with the Red Queen, and full in sight of the
hill she had been so long aiming at.

'Where do you come from?' said the Red Queen. 'And where are you going?
Look up, speak nicely, and don't twiddle your fingers all the time.'

Alice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she
could, that she had lost her way.

'I don't know what you mean by YOUR way,' said the Queen: 'all the ways
about here belong to ME--but why did you come out here at all?' she
added in a kinder tone. 'Curtsey while you're thinking what to say, it
saves time.'

Alice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of the
Queen to disbelieve it. 'I'll try it when I go home,' she thought to
herself, 'the next time I'm a little late for dinner.'

'It's time for you to answer now,' the Queen said, looking at her watch:
'open your mouth a LITTLE wider when you speak, and always say "your
Majesty."'

'I only wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty--'

'That's right,' said the Queen, patting her on the head, which Alice
didn't like at all, 'though, when you say "garden,"--I'VE seen gardens,
compared with which this would be a wilderness.'

Alice didn't dare to argue the point, but went on: '--and I thought I'd
try and find my way to the top of that hill--'

'When you say "hill,"' the Queen interrupted, '_I_ could show you hills,
in comparison with which you'd call that a valley.'

'No, I shouldn't,' said Alice, surprised into contradicting her at last:
'a hill CAN'T be a valley, you know. That would be nonsense--'

The Red Queen shook her head, 'You may call it "nonsense" if you like,'
she said, 'but I'VE heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as
sensible as a dictionary!'

Alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the Queen's tone that she
was a LITTLE offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to
the top of the little hill.

For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all
directions over the country--and a most curious country it was. There
were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side
to side, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number
of little green hedges, that reached from brook to brook.

'I declare it's marked out just like a large chessboard!' Alice said at
last. 'There ought to be some men moving about somewhere--and so there
are!' She added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quick
with excitement as she went on. 'It's a great huge game of chess that's
being played--all over the world--if this IS the world at all, you know.
Oh, what fun it is! How I WISH I was one of them! I wouldn't mind being
a Pawn, if only I might join--though of course I should LIKE to be a
Queen, best.'

She glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this, but her
companion only smiled pleasantly, and said, 'That's easily managed. You
can be the White Queen's Pawn, if you like, as Lily's too young to
play; and you're in the Second Square to begin with: when you get to
the Eighth Square you'll be a Queen--' Just at this moment, somehow or
other, they began to run.

Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it
was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand
in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep
up with her: and still the Queen kept crying 'Faster! Faster!' but Alice
felt she COULD NOT go faster, though she had not breath left to say so.

The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other
things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they
went, they never seemed to pass anything. 'I wonder if all the things
move along with us?' thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to
guess her thoughts, for she cried, 'Faster! Don't try to talk!'

Not that Alice had any idea of doing THAT. She felt as if she would
never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and
still the Queen cried 'Faster! Faster!' and dragged her along. 'Are we
nearly there?' Alice managed to pant out at last.

'Nearly there!' the Queen repeated. 'Why, we passed it ten minutes ago!
Faster!' And they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling
in Alice's ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she fancied.

'Now! Now!' cried the Queen. 'Faster! Faster!' And they went so fast
that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the
ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as Alice was getting quite
exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground,
breathless and giddy.

The Queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, 'You may rest
a little now.'

Alice looked round her in great surprise. 'Why, I do believe we've been
under this tree the whole time! Everything's just as it was!'

'Of course it is,' said the Queen, 'what would you have it?'

'Well, in OUR country,' said Alice, still panting a little, 'you'd
generally get to somewhere else--if you ran very fast for a long time,
as we've been doing.'

'A slow sort of country!' said the Queen. 'Now, HERE, you see, it takes
all the running YOU can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to
get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!'

'I'd rather not try, please!' said Alice. 'I'm quite content to stay
here--only I AM so hot and thirsty!'

'I know what YOU'D like!' the Queen said good-naturedly, taking a little
box out of her pocket. 'Have a biscuit?'

Alice thought it would not be civil to say 'No,' though it wasn't at all
what she wanted. So she took it, and ate it as well as she could: and it
was VERY dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all
her life.

'While you're refreshing yourself,' said the Queen, 'I'll just take
the measurements.' And she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in
inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in here
and there.

'At the end of two yards,' she said, putting in a peg to mark the
distance, 'I shall give you your directions--have another biscuit?'

'No, thank you,' said Alice: 'one's QUITE enough!'

'Thirst quenched, I hope?' said the Queen.

Alice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the Queen did not
wait for an answer, but went on. 'At the end of THREE yards I shall
repeat them--for fear of your forgetting them. At the end of FOUR, I
shall say good-bye. And at the end of FIVE, I shall go!'

She had got all the pegs put in by this time, and Alice looked on
with great interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly
walking down the row.

At the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, 'A pawn goes two squares
in its first move, you know. So you'll go VERY quickly through the Third
Square--by railway, I should think--and you'll find yourself in the
Fourth Square in no time. Well, THAT square belongs to Tweedledum and
Tweedledee--the Fifth is mostly water--the Sixth belongs to Humpty
Dumpty--But you make no remark?'

'I--I didn't know I had to make one--just then,' Alice faltered out.

'You SHOULD have said, "It's extremely kind of you to tell me all
this"--however, we'll suppose it said--the Seventh Square is all
forest--however, one of the Knights will show you the way--and in the
Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and it's all feasting and
fun!' Alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down again.

At the next peg the Queen turned again, and this time she said, 'Speak
in French when you can't think of the English for a thing--turn out your
toes as you walk--and remember who you are!' She did not wait for Alice
to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, where she
turned for a moment to say 'good-bye,' and then hurried on to the last.

How it happened, Alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last
peg, she was gone. Whether she vanished into the air, or whether she
ran quickly into the wood ('and she CAN run very fast!' thought Alice),
there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began to
remember that she was a Pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to
move.




CHAPTER III. Looking-Glass Insects

Of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the
country she was going to travel through. 'It's something very like
learning geography,' thought Alice, as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of
being able to see a little further. 'Principal rivers--there ARE none.
Principal mountains--I'm on the only one, but I don't think it's got any
name. Principal towns--why, what ARE those creatures, making honey down
there? They can't be bees--nobody ever saw bees a mile off, you know--'
and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that was
bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them, 'just
as if it was a regular bee,' thought Alice.

However, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was an
elephant--as Alice soon found out, though the idea quite took her breath
away at first. 'And what enormous flowers they must be!' was her next
idea. 'Something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks put
to them--and what quantities of honey they must make! I think I'll go
down and--no, I won't JUST yet,' she went on, checking herself just as
she was beginning to run down the hill, and trying to find some excuse
for turning shy so suddenly. 'It'll never do to go down among them
without a good long branch to brush them away--and what fun it'll be
when they ask me how I like my walk. I shall say--"Oh, I like it well
enough--"' (here came the favourite little toss of the head), '"only it
was so dusty and hot, and the elephants did tease so!"'

'I think I'll go down the other way,' she said after a pause: 'and
perhaps I may visit the elephants later on. Besides, I do so want to get
into the Third Square!'

So with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of
the six little brooks.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

'Tickets, please!' said the Guard, putting his head in at the window.
In a moment everybody was holding out a ticket: they were about the same
size as the people, and quite seemed to fill the carriage.

'Now then! Show your ticket, child!' the Guard went on, looking angrily
at Alice. And a great many voices all said together ('like the chorus of
a song,' thought Alice), 'Don't keep him waiting, child! Why, his time
is worth a thousand pounds a minute!'

'I'm afraid I haven't got one,' Alice said in a frightened tone: 'there
wasn't a ticket-office where I came from.' And again the chorus of
voices went on. 'There wasn't room for one where she came from. The land
there is worth a thousand pounds an inch!'

'Don't make excuses,' said the Guard: 'you should have bought one from
the engine-driver.' And once more the chorus of voices went on with 'The
man that drives the engine. Why, the smoke alone is worth a thousand
pounds a puff!'

Alice thought to herself, 'Then there's no use in speaking.' The
voices didn't join in this time, as she hadn't spoken, but to her
great surprise, they all THOUGHT in chorus (I hope you understand what
THINKING IN CHORUS means--for I must confess that _I_ don't), 'Better
say nothing at all. Language is worth a thousand pounds a word!'

'I shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight, I know I shall!' thought
Alice.

All this time the Guard was looking at her, first through a telescope,
then through a microscope, and then through an opera-glass. At last he
said, 'You're travelling the wrong way,' and shut up the window and went
away.

'So young a child,' said the gentleman sitting opposite to her (he was
dressed in white paper), 'ought to know which way she's going, even if
she doesn't know her own name!'

A Goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in white, shut his
eyes and said in a loud voice, 'She ought to know her way to the
ticket-office, even if she doesn't know her alphabet!'

There was a Beetle sitting next to the Goat (it was a very queer
carriage-full of passengers altogether), and, as the rule seemed to be
that they should all speak in turn, HE went on with 'She'll have to go
back from here as luggage!'

Alice couldn't see who was sitting beyond the Beetle, but a hoarse voice
spoke next. 'Change engines--' it said, and was obliged to leave off.

'It sounds like a horse,' Alice thought to herself. And an extremely
small voice, close to her ear, said, 'You might make a joke on
that--something about "horse" and "hoarse," you know.'

Then a very gentle voice in the distance said, 'She must be labelled
"Lass, with care," you know--'

And after that other voices went on ('What a number of people there are
in the carriage!' thought Alice), saying, 'She must go by post, as she's
got a head on her--' 'She must be sent as a message by the telegraph--'
'She must draw the train herself the rest of the way--' and so on.

But the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered
in her ear, 'Never mind what they all say, my dear, but take a
return-ticket every time the train stops.'

'Indeed I shan't!' Alice said rather impatiently. 'I don't belong to
this railway journey at all--I was in a wood just now--and I wish I
could get back there.'

'You might make a joke on THAT,' said the little voice close to her ear:
'something about "you WOULD if you could," you know.'

'Don't tease so,' said Alice, looking about in vain to see where the
voice came from; 'if you're so anxious to have a joke made, why don't
you make one yourself?'

The little voice sighed deeply: it was VERY unhappy, evidently, and
Alice would have said something pitying to comfort it, 'If it would only
sigh like other people!' she thought. But this was such a wonderfully
small sigh, that she wouldn't have heard it at all, if it hadn't come
QUITE close to her ear. The consequence of this was that it tickled her
ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of
the poor little creature.

'I know you are a friend,' the little voice went on; 'a dear friend, and
an old friend. And you won't hurt me, though I AM an insect.'

'What kind of insect?' Alice inquired a little anxiously. What she
really wanted to know was, whether it could sting or not, but she
thought this wouldn't be quite a civil question to ask.

'What, then you don't--' the little voice began, when it was drowned by
a shrill scream from the engine, and everybody jumped up in alarm, Alice
among the rest.

The Horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew it in
and said, 'It's only a brook we have to jump over.' Everybody seemed
satisfied with this, though Alice felt a little nervous at the idea of
trains jumping at all. 'However, it'll take us into the Fourth Square,
that's some comfort!' she said to herself. In another moment she felt
the carriage rise straight up into the air, and in her fright she caught
at the thing nearest to her hand, which happened to be the Goat's beard.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

But the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it, and she found
herself sitting quietly under a tree--while the Gnat (for that was the
insect she had been talking to) was balancing itself on a twig just over
her head, and fanning her with its wings.

It certainly was a VERY large Gnat: 'about the size of a chicken,' Alice
thought. Still, she couldn't feel nervous with it, after they had been
talking together so long.

'--then you don't like all insects?' the Gnat went on, as quietly as if
nothing had happened.

'I like them when they can talk,' Alice said. 'None of them ever talk,
where _I_ come from.'

'What sort of insects do you rejoice in, where YOU come from?' the Gnat
inquired.

'I don't REJOICE in insects at all,' Alice explained, 'because I'm
rather afraid of them--at least the large kinds. But I can tell you the
names of some of them.'

'Of course they answer to their names?' the Gnat remarked carelessly.

'I never knew them to do it.'

'What's the use of their having names,' the Gnat said, 'if they won't
answer to them?'

'No use to THEM,' said Alice; 'but it's useful to the people who name
them, I suppose. If not, why do things have names at all?'

'I can't say,' the Gnat replied. 'Further on, in the wood down there,
they've got no names--however, go on with your list of insects: you're
wasting time.'

'Well, there's the Horse-fly,' Alice began, counting off the names on
her fingers.

'All right,' said the Gnat: 'half way up that bush, you'll see a
Rocking-horse-fly, if you look. It's made entirely of wood, and gets
about by swinging itself from branch to branch.'

'What does it live on?' Alice asked, with great curiosity.

'Sap and sawdust,' said the Gnat. 'Go on with the list.'

Alice looked up at the Rocking-horse-fly with great interest, and made
up her mind that it must have been just repainted, it looked so bright
and sticky; and then she went on.

'And there's the Dragon-fly.'

'Look on the branch above your head,' said the Gnat, 'and there you'll
find a snap-dragon-fly. Its body is made of plum-pudding, its wings of
holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.'

'And what does it live on?'

'Frumenty and mince pie,' the Gnat replied; 'and it makes its nest in a
Christmas box.'

'And then there's the Butterfly,' Alice went on, after she had taken
a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to
herself, 'I wonder if that's the reason insects are so fond of flying
into candles--because they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies!'

'Crawling at your feet,' said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet back in
some alarm), 'you may observe a Bread-and-Butterfly. Its wings are thin
slices of Bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump
of sugar.'

'And what does IT live on?'

'Weak tea with cream in it.'

A new difficulty came into Alice's head. 'Supposing it couldn't find
any?' she suggested.

'Then it would die, of course.'

'But that must happen very often,' Alice remarked thoughtfully.

'It always happens,' said the Gnat.

After this, Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. The Gnat
amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last
it settled again and remarked, 'I suppose you don't want to lose your
name?'

'No, indeed,' Alice said, a little anxiously.

'And yet I don't know,' the Gnat went on in a careless tone: 'only think
how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it!
For instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons, she
would call out "come here--," and there she would have to leave off,
because there wouldn't be any name for her to call, and of course you
wouldn't have to go, you know.'

'That would never do, I'm sure,' said Alice: 'the governess would never
think of excusing me lessons for that. If she couldn't remember my name,
she'd call me "Miss!" as the servants do.'

'Well, if she said "Miss," and didn't say anything more,' the Gnat
remarked, 'of course you'd miss your lessons. That's a joke. I wish YOU
had made it.'

'Why do you wish _I_ had made it?' Alice asked. 'It's a very bad one.'

But the Gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling down
its cheeks.

'You shouldn't make jokes,' Alice said, 'if it makes you so unhappy.'

Then came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the
poor Gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when Alice
looked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as
she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, she got up and
walked on.

She very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other side of
it: it looked much darker than the last wood, and Alice felt a LITTLE
timid about going into it. However, on second thoughts, she made up her
mind to go on: 'for I certainly won't go BACK,' she thought to herself,
and this was the only way to the Eighth Square.

'This must be the wood,' she said thoughtfully to herself, 'where
things have no names. I wonder what'll become of MY name when I go in?
I shouldn't like to lose it at all--because they'd have to give me
another, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one. But then
the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old
name! That's just like the advertisements, you know, when people lose
dogs--"ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF 'DASH:' HAD ON A BRASS COLLAR"--just fancy
calling everything you met "Alice," till one of them answered! Only they
wouldn't answer at all, if they were wise.'

She was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked
very cool and shady. 'Well, at any rate it's a great comfort,' she
said as she stepped under the trees, 'after being so hot, to get into
the--into WHAT?' she went on, rather surprised at not being able to
think of the word. 'I mean to get under the--under the--under THIS, you
know!' putting her hand on the trunk of the tree. 'What DOES it call
itself, I wonder? I do believe it's got no name--why, to be sure it
hasn't!'

She stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly began again.
'Then it really HAS happened, after all! And now, who am I? I WILL
remember, if I can! I'm determined to do it!' But being determined
didn't help much, and all she could say, after a great deal of puzzling,
was, 'L, I KNOW it begins with L!'

Just then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked at Alice with its large
gentle eyes, but didn't seem at all frightened. 'Here then! Here then!'
Alice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it only
started back a little, and then stood looking at her again.

'What do you call yourself?' the Fawn said at last. Such a soft sweet
voice it had!

'I wish I knew!' thought poor Alice. She answered, rather sadly,
'Nothing, just now.'

'Think again,' it said: 'that won't do.'

Alice thought, but nothing came of it. 'Please, would you tell me
what YOU call yourself?' she said timidly. 'I think that might help a
little.'

'I'll tell you, if you'll move a little further on,' the Fawn said. 'I
can't remember here.'

So they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her arms clasped
lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out into
another open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air,
and shook itself free from Alice's arms. 'I'm a Fawn!' it cried out in a
voice of delight, 'and, dear me! you're a human child!' A sudden look of
alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it had
darted away at full speed.

Alice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation at
having lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly. 'However, I
know my name now.' she said, 'that's SOME comfort. Alice--Alice--I won't
forget it again. And now, which of these finger-posts ought I to follow,
I wonder?'

It was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one
road through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it.
'I'll settle it,' Alice said to herself, 'when the road divides and they
point different ways.'

But this did not seem likely to happen. She went on and on, a long way,
but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts
pointing the same way, one marked 'TO TWEEDLEDUM'S HOUSE' and the other
'TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE.'

'I do believe,' said Alice at last, 'that they live in the same house! I
wonder I never thought of that before--But I can't stay there long. I'll
just call and say "how d'you do?" and ask them the way out of the wood.
If I could only get to the Eighth Square before it gets dark!' So she
wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a sharp
corner, she came upon two fat little men, so suddenly that she could not
help starting back, but in another moment she recovered herself, feeling
sure that they must be.




CHAPTER IV. Tweedledum And Tweedledee

They were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other's
neck, and Alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them
had 'DUM' embroidered on his collar, and the other 'DEE.' 'I suppose
they've each got "TWEEDLE" round at the back of the collar,' she said to
herself.

They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was
just looking round to see if the word "TWEEDLE" was written at the back
of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one
marked 'DUM.'

'If you think we're wax-works,' he said, 'you ought to pay, you know.
Wax-works weren't made to be looked at for nothing, nohow!'

'Contrariwise,' added the one marked 'DEE,' 'if you think we're alive,
you ought to speak.'

'I'm sure I'm very sorry,' was all Alice could say; for the words of the
old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock, and
she could hardly help saying them out loud:--


     'Tweedledum and Tweedledee
      Agreed to have a battle;
     For Tweedledum said Tweedledee
      Had spoiled his nice new rattle.

     Just then flew down a monstrous crow,
      As black as a tar-barrel;
     Which frightened both the heroes so,
      They quite forgot their quarrel.'

'I know what you're thinking about,' said Tweedledum: 'but it isn't so,
nohow.'

'Contrariwise,' continued Tweedledee, 'if it was so, it might be; and if
it were so, it would be; but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic.'

'I was thinking,' Alice said very politely, 'which is the best way out
of this wood: it's getting so dark. Would you tell me, please?'

But the little men only looked at each other and grinned.

They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that Alice
couldn't help pointing her finger at Tweedledum, and saying 'First Boy!'

'Nohow!' Tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth up again with
a snap.

'Next Boy!' said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she felt quite
certain he would only shout out 'Contrariwise!' and so he did.

'You've been wrong!' cried Tweedledum. 'The first thing in a visit is to
say "How d'ye do?" and shake hands!' And here the two brothers gave each
other a hug, and then they held out the two hands that were free, to
shake hands with her.

Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear
of hurting the other one's feelings; so, as the best way out of the
difficulty, she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they
were dancing round in a ring. This seemed quite natural (she remembered
afterwards), and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it
seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing, and it was
done (as well as she could make it out) by the branches rubbing one
across the other, like fiddles and fiddle-sticks.

'But it certainly WAS funny,' (Alice said afterwards, when she was
telling her sister the history of all this,) 'to find myself singing
"HERE WE GO ROUND THE MULBERRY BUSH." I don't know when I began it, but
somehow I felt as if I'd been singing it a long long time!'

The other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath. 'Four times
round is enough for one dance,' Tweedledum panted out, and they left
off dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at the same
moment.

Then they let go of Alice's hands, and stood looking at her for a
minute: there was a rather awkward pause, as Alice didn't know how to
begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with. 'It
would never do to say "How d'ye do?" NOW,' she said to herself: 'we seem
to have got beyond that, somehow!'

'I hope you're not much tired?' she said at last.

'Nohow. And thank you VERY much for asking,' said Tweedledum.

'So much obliged!' added Tweedledee. 'You like poetry?'

'Ye-es, pretty well--SOME poetry,' Alice said doubtfully. 'Would you
tell me which road leads out of the wood?'

'What shall I repeat to her?' said Tweedledee, looking round at
Tweedledum with great solemn eyes, and not noticing Alice's question.

'"THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER" is the longest,' Tweedledum replied,
giving his brother an affectionate hug.

Tweedledee began instantly:

       'The sun was shining--'

Here Alice ventured to interrupt him. 'If it's VERY long,' she said, as
politely as she could, 'would you please tell me first which road--'

Tweedledee smiled gently, and began again:

     'The sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
     He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright--
     And this was odd, because it was
      The middle of the night.

     The moon was shining sulkily,
      Because she thought the sun
     Had got no business to be there
      After the day was done--
     "It's very rude of him," she said,
      "To come and spoil the fun!"

     The sea was wet as wet could be,
      The sands were dry as dry.
     You could not see a cloud, because
      No cloud was in the sky:
     No birds were flying over head--
      There were no birds to fly.

     The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Were walking close at hand;
     They wept like anything to see
      Such quantities of sand:
     "If this were only cleared away,"
      They said, "it WOULD be grand!"

     "If seven maids with seven mops
      Swept it for half a year,
     Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
      "That they could get it clear?"
     "I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
      And shed a bitter tear.

     "O Oysters, come and walk with us!"
      The Walrus did beseech.
     "A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
      Along the briny beach:
     We cannot do with more than four,
      To give a hand to each."

     The eldest Oyster looked at him.
      But never a word he said:
     The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
      And shook his heavy head--
     Meaning to say he did not choose
      To leave the oyster-bed.

     But four young oysters hurried up,
      All eager for the treat:
     Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
      Their shoes were clean and neat--
     And this was odd, because, you know,
      They hadn't any feet.

     Four other Oysters followed them,
      And yet another four;
     And thick and fast they came at last,
      And more, and more, and more--
     All hopping through the frothy waves,
      And scrambling to the shore.

     The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Walked on a mile or so,
     And then they rested on a rock
      Conveniently low:
     And all the little Oysters stood
      And waited in a row.

     "The time has come," the Walrus said,
      "To talk of many things:
     Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
      Of cabbages--and kings--
     And why the sea is boiling hot--
      And whether pigs have wings."

     "But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
      "Before we have our chat;
     For some of us are out of breath,
      And all of us are fat!"
     "No hurry!" said the Carpenter.
      They thanked him much for that.

     "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
      "Is what we chiefly need:
     Pepper and vinegar besides
      Are very good indeed--
     Now if you're ready Oysters dear,
      We can begin to feed."

     "But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
      Turning a little blue,
     "After such kindness, that would be
      A dismal thing to do!"
     "The night is fine," the Walrus said
      "Do you admire the view?

     "It was so kind of you to come!
      And you are very nice!"
     The Carpenter said nothing but
      "Cut us another slice:
     I wish you were not quite so deaf--
      I've had to ask you twice!"

     "It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
      "To play them such a trick,
     After we've brought them out so far,
      And made them trot so quick!"
     The Carpenter said nothing but
      "The butter's spread too thick!"

     "I weep for you," the Walrus said.
      "I deeply sympathize."
     With sobs and tears he sorted out
      Those of the largest size.
     Holding his pocket handkerchief
      Before his streaming eyes.

     "O Oysters," said the Carpenter.
      "You've had a pleasant run!
     Shall we be trotting home again?"
      But answer came there none--
     And that was scarcely odd, because
      They'd eaten every one.'

'I like the Walrus best,' said Alice: 'because you see he was a LITTLE
sorry for the poor oysters.'

'He ate more than the Carpenter, though,' said Tweedledee. 'You see he
held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter couldn't count how
many he took: contrariwise.'

'That was mean!' Alice said indignantly. 'Then I like the Carpenter
best--if he didn't eat so many as the Walrus.'

'But he ate as many as he could get,' said Tweedledum.

This was a puzzler. After a pause, Alice began, 'Well! They were BOTH
very unpleasant characters--' Here she checked herself in some alarm,
at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large
steam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more likely
to be a wild beast. 'Are there any lions or tigers about here?' she
asked timidly.

'It's only the Red King snoring,' said Tweedledee.

'Come and look at him!' the brothers cried, and they each took one of
Alice's hands, and led her up to where the King was sleeping.

'Isn't he a LOVELY sight?' said Tweedledum.

Alice couldn't say honestly that he was. He had a tall red night-cap on,
with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap,
and snoring loud--'fit to snore his head off!' as Tweedledum remarked.

'I'm afraid he'll catch cold with lying on the damp grass,' said Alice,
who was a very thoughtful little girl.

'He's dreaming now,' said Tweedledee: 'and what do you think he's
dreaming about?'

Alice said 'Nobody can guess that.'

'Why, about YOU!' Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands triumphantly.
'And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be?'

'Where I am now, of course,' said Alice.

'Not you!' Tweedledee retorted contemptuously. 'You'd be nowhere. Why,
you're only a sort of thing in his dream!'

'If that there King was to wake,' added Tweedledum, 'you'd go
out--bang!--just like a candle!'

'I shouldn't!' Alice exclaimed indignantly. 'Besides, if I'M only a sort
of thing in his dream, what are YOU, I should like to know?'

'Ditto' said Tweedledum.

'Ditto, ditto' cried Tweedledee.

He shouted this so loud that Alice couldn't help saying, 'Hush! You'll
be waking him, I'm afraid, if you make so much noise.'

'Well, it no use YOUR talking about waking him,' said Tweedledum, 'when
you're only one of the things in his dream. You know very well you're
not real.'

'I AM real!' said Alice and began to cry.

'You won't make yourself a bit realler by crying,' Tweedledee remarked:
'there's nothing to cry about.'

'If I wasn't real,' Alice said--half-laughing through her tears, it all
seemed so ridiculous--'I shouldn't be able to cry.'

'I hope you don't suppose those are real tears?' Tweedledum interrupted
in a tone of great contempt.

'I know they're talking nonsense,' Alice thought to herself: 'and it's
foolish to cry about it.' So she brushed away her tears, and went on as
cheerfully as she could. 'At any rate I'd better be getting out of the
wood, for really it's coming on very dark. Do you think it's going to
rain?'

Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother, and
looked up into it. 'No, I don't think it is,' he said: 'at least--not
under HERE. Nohow.'

'But it may rain OUTSIDE?'

'It may--if it chooses,' said Tweedledee: 'we've no objection.
Contrariwise.'

'Selfish things!' thought Alice, and she was just going to say
'Good-night' and leave them, when Tweedledum sprang out from under the
umbrella and seized her by the wrist.

'Do you see THAT?' he said, in a voice choking with passion, and
his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed with a
trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree.

'It's only a rattle,' Alice said, after a careful examination of the
little white thing. 'Not a rattleSNAKE, you know,' she added hastily,
thinking that he was frightened: 'only an old rattle--quite old and
broken.'

'I knew it was!' cried Tweedledum, beginning to stamp about wildly and
tear his hair. 'It's spoilt, of course!' Here he looked at Tweedledee,
who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide himself under
the umbrella.

Alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone, 'You
needn't be so angry about an old rattle.'

'But it isn't old!' Tweedledum cried, in a greater fury than ever. 'It's
new, I tell you--I bought it yesterday--my nice new RATTLE!' and his
voice rose to a perfect scream.

All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella,
with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that it
quite took off Alice's attention from the angry brother. But he couldn't
quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the
umbrella, with only his head out: and there he lay, opening and shutting
his mouth and his large eyes--'looking more like a fish than anything
else,' Alice thought.

'Of course you agree to have a battle?' Tweedledum said in a calmer
tone.

'I suppose so,' the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of the
umbrella: 'only SHE must help us to dress up, you know.'

So the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned
in a minute with their arms full of things--such as bolsters, blankets,
hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. 'I hope you're
a good hand at pinning and tying strings?' Tweedledum remarked. 'Every
one of these things has got to go on, somehow or other.'

Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything
in all her life--the way those two bustled about--and the quantity of
things they put on--and the trouble they gave her in tying strings and
fastening buttons--'Really they'll be more like bundles of old clothes
than anything else, by the time they're ready!' she said to herself, as
she arranged a bolster round the neck of Tweedledee, 'to keep his head
from being cut off,' as he said.

'You know,' he added very gravely, 'it's one of the most serious things
that can possibly happen to one in a battle--to get one's head cut off.'

Alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough, for fear
of hurting his feelings.

'Do I look very pale?' said Tweedledum, coming up to have his helmet
tied on. (He CALLED it a helmet, though it certainly looked much more
like a saucepan.)

'Well--yes--a LITTLE,' Alice replied gently.

'I'm very brave generally,' he went on in a low voice: 'only to-day I
happen to have a headache.'

'And I'VE got a toothache!' said Tweedledee, who had overheard the
remark. 'I'm far worse off than you!'

'Then you'd better not fight to-day,' said Alice, thinking it a good
opportunity to make peace.

'We MUST have a bit of a fight, but I don't care about going on long,'
said Tweedledum. 'What's the time now?'

Tweedledee looked at his watch, and said 'Half-past four.'

'Let's fight till six, and then have dinner,' said Tweedledum.

'Very well,' the other said, rather sadly: 'and SHE can watch us--only
you'd better not come VERY close,' he added: 'I generally hit everything
I can see--when I get really excited.'

'And _I_ hit everything within reach,' cried Tweedledum, 'whether I can
see it or not!'

Alice laughed. 'You must hit the TREES pretty often, I should think,'
she said.

Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile. 'I don't suppose,'
he said, 'there'll be a tree left standing, for ever so far round, by
the time we've finished!'

'And all about a rattle!' said Alice, still hoping to make them a LITTLE
ashamed of fighting for such a trifle.

'I shouldn't have minded it so much,' said Tweedledum, 'if it hadn't
been a new one.'

'I wish the monstrous crow would come!' thought Alice.

'There's only one sword, you know,' Tweedledum said to his brother:
'but you can have the umbrella--it's quite as sharp. Only we must begin
quick. It's getting as dark as it can.'

'And darker,' said Tweedledee.

It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought there must be a
thunderstorm coming on. 'What a thick black cloud that is!' she said.
'And how fast it comes! Why, I do believe it's got wings!'

'It's the crow!' Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm: and
the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment.

Alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree.
'It can never get at me HERE,' she thought: 'it's far too large to
squeeze itself in among the trees. But I wish it wouldn't flap its wings
so--it makes quite a hurricane in the wood--here's somebody's shawl
being blown away!'




CHAPTER V. Wool and Water

She caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the owner: in
another moment the White Queen came running wildly through the wood,
with both arms stretched out wide, as if she were flying, and Alice very
civilly went to meet her with the shawl.

'I'm very glad I happened to be in the way,' Alice said, as she helped
her to put on her shawl again.

The White Queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way,
and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like
'bread-and-butter, bread-and-butter,' and Alice felt that if there was
to be any conversation at all, she must manage it herself. So she began
rather timidly: 'Am I addressing the White Queen?'

'Well, yes, if you call that a-dressing,' The Queen said. 'It isn't MY
notion of the thing, at all.'

Alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very
beginning of their conversation, so she smiled and said, 'If your
Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, I'll do it as well as
I can.'

'But I don't want it done at all!' groaned the poor Queen. 'I've been
a-dressing myself for the last two hours.'

It would have been all the better, as it seemed to Alice, if she had got
some one else to dress her, she was so dreadfully untidy. 'Every
single thing's crooked,' Alice thought to herself, 'and she's all over
pins!--may I put your shawl straight for you?' she added aloud.

'I don't know what's the matter with it!' the Queen said, in a
melancholy voice. 'It's out of temper, I think. I've pinned it here, and
I've pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it!'

'It CAN'T go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side,' Alice
said, as she gently put it right for her; 'and, dear me, what a state
your hair is in!'

'The brush has got entangled in it!' the Queen said with a sigh. 'And I
lost the comb yesterday.'

Alice carefully released the brush, and did her best to get the hair
into order. 'Come, you look rather better now!' she said, after altering
most of the pins. 'But really you should have a lady's maid!'

'I'm sure I'll take you with pleasure!' the Queen said. 'Twopence a
week, and jam every other day.'

Alice couldn't help laughing, as she said, 'I don't want you to hire
ME--and I don't care for jam.'

'It's very good jam,' said the Queen.

'Well, I don't want any TO-DAY, at any rate.'

'You couldn't have it if you DID want it,' the Queen said. 'The rule is,
jam to-morrow and jam yesterday--but never jam to-day.'

'It MUST come sometimes to "jam to-day,"' Alice objected.

'No, it can't,' said the Queen. 'It's jam every OTHER day: to-day isn't
any OTHER day, you know.'

'I don't understand you,' said Alice. 'It's dreadfully confusing!'

'That's the effect of living backwards,' the Queen said kindly: 'it
always makes one a little giddy at first--'

'Living backwards!' Alice repeated in great astonishment. 'I never heard
of such a thing!'

'--but there's one great advantage in it, that one's memory works both
ways.'

'I'm sure MINE only works one way,' Alice remarked. 'I can't remember
things before they happen.'

'It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards,' the Queen
remarked.

'What sort of things do YOU remember best?' Alice ventured to ask.

'Oh, things that happened the week after next,' the Queen replied in a
careless tone. 'For instance, now,' she went on, sticking a large piece
of plaster [band-aid] on her finger as she spoke, 'there's the King's
Messenger. He's in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesn't
even begin till next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of
all.'

'Suppose he never commits the crime?' said Alice.

'That would be all the better, wouldn't it?' the Queen said, as she
bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon.

Alice felt there was no denying THAT. 'Of course it would be all
the better,' she said: 'but it wouldn't be all the better his being
punished.'

'You're wrong THERE, at any rate,' said the Queen: 'were YOU ever
punished?'

'Only for faults,' said Alice.

'And you were all the better for it, I know!' the Queen said
triumphantly.

'Yes, but then I HAD done the things I was punished for,' said Alice:
'that makes all the difference.'

'But if you HADN'T done them,' the Queen said, 'that would have been
better still; better, and better, and better!' Her voice went higher
with each 'better,' till it got quite to a squeak at last.

Alice was just beginning to say 'There's a mistake somewhere--,' when
the Queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence
unfinished. 'Oh, oh, oh!' shouted the Queen, shaking her hand about as
if she wanted to shake it off. 'My finger's bleeding! Oh, oh, oh, oh!'

Her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine, that
Alice had to hold both her hands over her ears.

'What IS the matter?' she said, as soon as there was a chance of making
herself heard. 'Have you pricked your finger?'

'I haven't pricked it YET,' the Queen said, 'but I soon shall--oh, oh,
oh!'

'When do you expect to do it?' Alice asked, feeling very much inclined
to laugh.

'When I fasten my shawl again,' the poor Queen groaned out: 'the brooch
will come undone directly. Oh, oh!' As she said the words the brooch
flew open, and the Queen clutched wildly at it, and tried to clasp it
again.

'Take care!' cried Alice. 'You're holding it all crooked!' And she
caught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had slipped, and the
Queen had pricked her finger.

'That accounts for the bleeding, you see,' she said to Alice with a
smile. 'Now you understand the way things happen here.'

'But why don't you scream now?' Alice asked, holding her hands ready to
put over her ears again.

'Why, I've done all the screaming already,' said the Queen. 'What would
be the good of having it all over again?'

By this time it was getting light. 'The crow must have flown away, I
think,' said Alice: 'I'm so glad it's gone. I thought it was the night
coming on.'

'I wish _I_ could manage to be glad!' the Queen said. 'Only I never
can remember the rule. You must be very happy, living in this wood, and
being glad whenever you like!'

'Only it is so VERY lonely here!' Alice said in a melancholy voice; and
at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her
cheeks.

'Oh, don't go on like that!' cried the poor Queen, wringing her hands in
despair. 'Consider what a great girl you are. Consider what a long way
you've come to-day. Consider what o'clock it is. Consider anything, only
don't cry!'

Alice could not help laughing at this, even in the midst of her tears.
'Can YOU keep from crying by considering things?' she asked.

'That's the way it's done,' the Queen said with great decision: 'nobody
can do two things at once, you know. Let's consider your age to begin
with--how old are you?'

'I'm seven and a half exactly.'

'You needn't say "exactually,"' the Queen remarked: 'I can believe
it without that. Now I'll give YOU something to believe. I'm just one
hundred and one, five months and a day.'

'I can't believe THAT!' said Alice.

'Can't you?' the Queen said in a pitying tone. 'Try again: draw a long
breath, and shut your eyes.'

Alice laughed. 'There's no use trying,' she said: 'one CAN'T believe
impossible things.'

'I daresay you haven't had much practice,' said the Queen. 'When I was
your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've
believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. There goes
the shawl again!'

The brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust of wind blew
the Queen's shawl across a little brook. The Queen spread out her arms
again, and went flying after it, and this time she succeeded in catching
it for herself. 'I've got it!' she cried in a triumphant tone. 'Now you
shall see me pin it on again, all by myself!'

'Then I hope your finger is better now?' Alice said very politely, as
she crossed the little brook after the Queen.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

'Oh, much better!' cried the Queen, her voice rising to a squeak as she
went on. 'Much be-etter! Be-etter! Be-e-e-etter! Be-e-ehh!' The last
word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that Alice quite started.

She looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up
in wool. Alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again. She couldn't make out
what had happened at all. Was she in a shop? And was that really--was it
really a SHEEP that was sitting on the other side of the counter? Rub as
she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little dark
shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her was
an old Sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and then
leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles.

'What is it you want to buy?' the Sheep said at last, looking up for a
moment from her knitting.

'I don't QUITE know yet,' Alice said, very gently. 'I should like to
look all round me first, if I might.'

'You may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like,' said the
Sheep: 'but you can't look ALL round you--unless you've got eyes at the
back of your head.'

But these, as it happened, Alice had NOT got: so she contented herself
with turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them.

The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things--but the
oddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf,
to make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always
quite empty: though the others round it were crowded as full as they
could hold.

'Things flow about so here!' she said at last in a plaintive tone, after
she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright thing,
that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a work-box, and was
always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at. 'And this one
is the most provoking of all--but I'll tell you what--' she added, as a
sudden thought struck her, 'I'll follow it up to the very top shelf of
all. It'll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, I expect!'

But even this plan failed: the 'thing' went through the ceiling as
quietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it.

'Are you a child or a teetotum?' the Sheep said, as she took up another
pair of needles. 'You'll make me giddy soon, if you go on turning round
like that.' She was now working with fourteen pairs at once, and Alice
couldn't help looking at her in great astonishment.

'How CAN she knit with so many?' the puzzled child thought to herself.
'She gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!'

'Can you row?' the Sheep asked, handing her a pair of knitting-needles
as she spoke.

'Yes, a little--but not on land--and not with needles--' Alice was
beginning to say, when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her
hands, and she found they were in a little boat, gliding along between
banks: so there was nothing for it but to do her best.

'Feather!' cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.

This didn't sound like a remark that needed any answer, so Alice said
nothing, but pulled away. There was something very queer about the
water, she thought, as every now and then the oars got fast in it, and
would hardly come out again.

'Feather! Feather!' the Sheep cried again, taking more needles. 'You'll
be catching a crab directly.'

'A dear little crab!' thought Alice. 'I should like that.'

'Didn't you hear me say "Feather"?' the Sheep cried angrily, taking up
quite a bunch of needles.

'Indeed I did,' said Alice: 'you've said it very often--and very loud.
Please, where ARE the crabs?'

'In the water, of course!' said the Sheep, sticking some of the needles
into her hair, as her hands were full. 'Feather, I say!'

'WHY do you say "feather" so often?' Alice asked at last, rather vexed.
'I'm not a bird!'

'You are,' said the Sheep: 'you're a little goose.'

This offended Alice a little, so there was no more conversation for a
minute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds of
weeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water, worse then ever),
and sometimes under trees, but always with the same tall river-banks
frowning over their heads.

'Oh, please! There are some scented rushes!' Alice cried in a sudden
transport of delight. 'There really are--and SUCH beauties!'

'You needn't say "please" to ME about 'em,' the Sheep said, without
looking up from her knitting: 'I didn't put 'em there, and I'm not going
to take 'em away.'

'No, but I meant--please, may we wait and pick some?' Alice pleaded. 'If
you don't mind stopping the boat for a minute.'

'How am _I_ to stop it?' said the Sheep. 'If you leave off rowing, it'll
stop of itself.'

So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it
glided gently in among the waving rushes. And then the little sleeves
were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep
to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off--and for
a while Alice forgot all about the Sheep and the knitting, as she
bent over the side of the boat, with just the ends of her tangled hair
dipping into the water--while with bright eager eyes she caught at one
bunch after another of the darling scented rushes.

'I only hope the boat won't tipple over!' she said to herself. 'Oh, WHAT
a lovely one! Only I couldn't quite reach it.' 'And it certainly DID
seem a little provoking ('almost as if it happened on purpose,' she
thought) that, though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as
the boat glided by, there was always a more lovely one that she couldn't
reach.

'The prettiest are always further!' she said at last, with a sigh at the
obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off, as, with flushed cheeks
and dripping hair and hands, she scrambled back into her place, and
began to arrange her new-found treasures.

What mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade, and
to lose all their scent and beauty, from the very moment that she
picked them? Even real scented rushes, you know, last only a very little
while--and these, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like snow, as
they lay in heaps at her feet--but Alice hardly noticed this, there were
so many other curious things to think about.

They hadn't gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got
fast in the water and WOULDN'T come out again (so Alice explained it
afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her
under the chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of 'Oh, oh,
oh!' from poor Alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down among
the heap of rushes.

However, she wasn't hurt, and was soon up again: the Sheep went on with
her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened. 'That was
a nice crab you caught!' she remarked, as Alice got back into her place,
very much relieved to find herself still in the boat.

'Was it? I didn't see it,' Said Alice, peeping cautiously over the side
of the boat into the dark water. 'I wish it hadn't let go--I should
so like to see a little crab to take home with me!' But the Sheep only
laughed scornfully, and went on with her knitting.

'Are there many crabs here?' said Alice.

'Crabs, and all sorts of things,' said the Sheep: 'plenty of choice,
only make up your mind. Now, what DO you want to buy?'

'To buy!' Alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half
frightened--for the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all
in a moment, and she was back again in the little dark shop.

'I should like to buy an egg, please,' she said timidly. 'How do you
sell them?'

'Fivepence farthing for one--Twopence for two,' the Sheep replied.

'Then two are cheaper than one?' Alice said in a surprised tone, taking
out her purse.

'Only you MUST eat them both, if you buy two,' said the Sheep.

'Then I'll have ONE, please,' said Alice, as she put the money down on
the counter. For she thought to herself, 'They mightn't be at all nice,
you know.'

The Sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said 'I
never put things into people's hands--that would never do--you must get
it for yourself.' And so saying, she went off to the other end of the
shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf.

'I wonder WHY it wouldn't do?' thought Alice, as she groped her way
among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark towards the end.
'The egg seems to get further away the more I walk towards it. Let me
see, is this a chair? Why, it's got branches, I declare! How very odd to
find trees growing here! And actually here's a little brook! Well, this
is the very queerest shop I ever saw!'

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *


So she went on, wondering more and more at every step, as everything
turned into a tree the moment she came up to it, and she quite expected
the egg to do the same.




CHAPTER VI. Humpty Dumpty

However, the egg only got larger and larger, and more and more human:
when she had come within a few yards of it, she saw that it had eyes
and a nose and mouth; and when she had come close to it, she saw clearly
that it was HUMPTY DUMPTY himself. 'It can't be anybody else!' she said
to herself. 'I'm as certain of it, as if his name were written all over
his face.'

It might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormous
face. Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a Turk, on
the top of a high wall--such a narrow one that Alice quite wondered how
he could keep his balance--and, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the
opposite direction, and he didn't take the least notice of her, she
thought he must be a stuffed figure after all.

'And how exactly like an egg he is!' she said aloud, standing with her
hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to
fall.

'It's VERY provoking,' Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence, looking
away from Alice as he spoke, 'to be called an egg--VERY!'

'I said you LOOKED like an egg, Sir,' Alice gently explained. 'And some
eggs are very pretty, you know' she added, hoping to turn her remark
into a sort of a compliment.

'Some people,' said Humpty Dumpty, looking away from her as usual, 'have
no more sense than a baby!'

Alice didn't know what to say to this: it wasn't at all like
conversation, she thought, as he never said anything to HER; in fact,
his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree--so she stood and
softly repeated to herself:--


     'Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall:
     Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
     All the King's horses and all the King's men
     Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.'


'That last line is much too long for the poetry,' she added, almost out
loud, forgetting that Humpty Dumpty would hear her.

'Don't stand there chattering to yourself like that,' Humpty Dumpty
said, looking at her for the first time, 'but tell me your name and your
business.'

'My NAME is Alice, but--'

'It's a stupid enough name!' Humpty Dumpty interrupted impatiently.
'What does it mean?'

'MUST a name mean something?' Alice asked doubtfully.

'Of course it must,' Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh: 'MY name
means the shape I am--and a good handsome shape it is, too. With a name
like yours, you might be any shape, almost.'

'Why do you sit out here all alone?' said Alice, not wishing to begin an
argument.

'Why, because there's nobody with me!' cried Humpty Dumpty. 'Did you
think I didn't know the answer to THAT? Ask another.'

'Don't you think you'd be safer down on the ground?' Alice went on, not
with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her good-natured
anxiety for the queer creature. 'That wall is so VERY narrow!'

'What tremendously easy riddles you ask!' Humpty Dumpty growled out. 'Of
course I don't think so! Why, if ever I DID fall off--which there's no
chance of--but IF I did--' Here he pursed up his lips and looked so solemn
and grand that Alice could hardly help laughing. 'IF I did fall,' he
went on, 'THE KING HAS PROMISED ME--ah, you may turn pale, if you like!
You didn't think I was going to say that, did you? THE KING HAS PROMISED ME--
WITH HIS VERY OWN MOUTH--to--to--'

'To send all his horses and all his men,' Alice interrupted, rather
unwisely.

'Now I declare that's too bad!' Humpty Dumpty cried, breaking into a
sudden passion. 'You've been listening at doors--and behind trees--and
down chimneys--or you couldn't have known it!'

'I haven't, indeed!' Alice said very gently. 'It's in a book.'

'Ah, well! They may write such things in a BOOK,' Humpty Dumpty said in
a calmer tone. 'That's what you call a History of England, that is.
Now, take a good look at me! I'm one that has spoken to a King, _I_ am:
mayhap you'll never see such another: and to show you I'm not proud, you
may shake hands with me!' And he grinned almost from ear to ear, as he
leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so)
and offered Alice his hand. She watched him a little anxiously as she
took it. 'If he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet
behind,' she thought: 'and then I don't know what would happen to his
head! I'm afraid it would come off!'

'Yes, all his horses and all his men,' Humpty Dumpty went on. 'They'd
pick me up again in a minute, THEY would! However, this conversation is
going on a little too fast: let's go back to the last remark but one.'

'I'm afraid I can't quite remember it,' Alice said very politely.

'In that case we start fresh,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'and it's my turn
to choose a subject--' ('He talks about it just as if it was a game!'
thought Alice.) 'So here's a question for you. How old did you say you
were?'

Alice made a short calculation, and said 'Seven years and six months.'

'Wrong!' Humpty Dumpty exclaimed triumphantly. 'You never said a word
like it!'

'I though you meant "How old ARE you?"' Alice explained.

'If I'd meant that, I'd have said it,' said Humpty Dumpty.

Alice didn't want to begin another argument, so she said nothing.

'Seven years and six months!' Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully. 'An
uncomfortable sort of age. Now if you'd asked MY advice, I'd have said
"Leave off at seven"--but it's too late now.'

'I never ask advice about growing,' Alice said indignantly.

'Too proud?' the other inquired.

Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion. 'I mean,' she said,
'that one can't help growing older.'

'ONE can't, perhaps,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'but TWO can. With proper
assistance, you might have left off at seven.'

'What a beautiful belt you've got on!' Alice suddenly remarked.

(They had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought: and if
they really were to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her turn
now.) 'At least,' she corrected herself on second thoughts, 'a beautiful
cravat, I should have said--no, a belt, I mean--I beg your pardon!' she
added in dismay, for Humpty Dumpty looked thoroughly offended, and she
began to wish she hadn't chosen that subject. 'If I only knew,' she
thought to herself, 'which was neck and which was waist!'

Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a
minute or two. When he DID speak again, it was in a deep growl.

'It is a--MOST--PROVOKING--thing,' he said at last, 'when a person
doesn't know a cravat from a belt!'

'I know it's very ignorant of me,' Alice said, in so humble a tone that
Humpty Dumpty relented.

'It's a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. It's a present
from the White King and Queen. There now!'

'Is it really?' said Alice, quite pleased to find that she HAD chosen a
good subject, after all.

'They gave it me,' Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he crossed
one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it, 'they gave it
me--for an un-birthday present.'

'I beg your pardon?' Alice said with a puzzled air.

'I'm not offended,' said Humpty Dumpty.

'I mean, what IS an un-birthday present?'

'A present given when it isn't your birthday, of course.'

Alice considered a little. 'I like birthday presents best,' she said at
last.

'You don't know what you're talking about!' cried Humpty Dumpty. 'How
many days are there in a year?'

'Three hundred and sixty-five,' said Alice.

'And how many birthdays have you?'

'One.'

'And if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five, what remains?'

'Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.'

Humpty Dumpty looked doubtful. 'I'd rather see that done on paper,' he
said.

Alice couldn't help smiling as she took out her memorandum-book, and
worked the sum for him:


               365
                1
               ____

               364
               ___

Humpty Dumpty took the book, and looked at it carefully. 'That seems to
be done right--' he began.

'You're holding it upside down!' Alice interrupted.

'To be sure I was!' Humpty Dumpty said gaily, as she turned it round for
him. 'I thought it looked a little queer. As I was saying, that SEEMS
to be done right--though I haven't time to look it over thoroughly just
now--and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty-four days
when you might get un-birthday presents--'

'Certainly,' said Alice.

'And only ONE for birthday presents, you know. There's glory for you!'

'I don't know what you mean by "glory,"' Alice said.

Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. 'Of course you don't--till I tell
you. I meant "there's a nice knock-down argument for you!"'

'But "glory" doesn't mean "a nice knock-down argument,"' Alice objected.

'When _I_ use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, 'it
means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor less.'

'The question is,' said Alice, 'whether you CAN make words mean so many
different things.'

'The question is,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'which is to be master--that's
all.'

Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute Humpty
Dumpty began again. 'They've a temper, some of them--particularly verbs,
they're the proudest--adjectives you can do anything with, but not
verbs--however, _I_ can manage the whole lot of them! Impenetrability!
That's what _I_ say!'

'Would you tell me, please,' said Alice 'what that means?'

'Now you talk like a reasonable child,' said Humpty Dumpty, looking very
much pleased. 'I meant by "impenetrability" that we've had enough of
that subject, and it would be just as well if you'd mention what you
mean to do next, as I suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest
of your life.'

'That's a great deal to make one word mean,' Alice said in a thoughtful
tone.

'When I make a word do a lot of work like that,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'I
always pay it extra.'

'Oh!' said Alice. She was too much puzzled to make any other remark.

'Ah, you should see 'em come round me of a Saturday night,' Humpty
Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side: 'for to get
their wages, you know.'

(Alice didn't venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see I
can't tell YOU.)

'You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,' said Alice. 'Would you
kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called "Jabberwocky"?'

'Let's hear it,' said Humpty Dumpty. 'I can explain all the poems that
were ever invented--and a good many that haven't been invented just
yet.'

This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse:

     'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.

'That's enough to begin with,' Humpty Dumpty interrupted: 'there
are plenty of hard words there. "BRILLIG" means four o'clock in the
afternoon--the time when you begin BROILING things for dinner.'

'That'll do very well,' said Alice: 'and "SLITHY"?'

'Well, "SLITHY" means "lithe and slimy." "Lithe" is the same as
"active." You see it's like a portmanteau--there are two meanings packed
up into one word.'

'I see it now,' Alice remarked thoughtfully: 'and what are "TOVES"?'

'Well, "TOVES" are something like badgers--they're something like
lizards--and they're something like corkscrews.'

'They must be very curious looking creatures.'

'They are that,' said Humpty Dumpty: 'also they make their nests under
sun-dials--also they live on cheese.'

'And what's the "GYRE" and to "GIMBLE"?'

'To "GYRE" is to go round and round like a gyroscope. To "GIMBLE" is to
make holes like a gimlet.'

'And "THE WABE" is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, I suppose?' said
Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity.

'Of course it is. It's called "WABE," you know, because it goes a long
way before it, and a long way behind it--'

'And a long way beyond it on each side,' Alice added.

'Exactly so. Well, then, "MIMSY" is "flimsy and miserable" (there's
another portmanteau for you). And a "BOROGOVE" is a thin shabby-looking
bird with its feathers sticking out all round--something like a live
mop.'

'And then "MOME RATHS"?' said Alice. 'I'm afraid I'm giving you a great
deal of trouble.'

'Well, a "RATH" is a sort of green pig: but "MOME" I'm not certain
about. I think it's short for "from home"--meaning that they'd lost
their way, you know.'

'And what does "OUTGRABE" mean?'

'Well, "OUTGRABING" is something between bellowing and whistling, with a
kind of sneeze in the middle: however, you'll hear it done, maybe--down
in the wood yonder--and when you've once heard it you'll be QUITE
content. Who's been repeating all that hard stuff to you?'

'I read it in a book,' said Alice. 'But I had some poetry repeated to
me, much easier than that, by--Tweedledee, I think it was.'

'As to poetry, you know,' said Humpty Dumpty, stretching out one of his
great hands, '_I_ can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it comes
to that--'

'Oh, it needn't come to that!' Alice hastily said, hoping to keep him
from beginning.

'The piece I'm going to repeat,' he went on without noticing her remark,
'was written entirely for your amusement.'

Alice felt that in that case she really OUGHT to listen to it, so she
sat down, and said 'Thank you' rather sadly.


     'In winter, when the fields are white,
     I sing this song for your delight--


only I don't sing it,' he added, as an explanation.

'I see you don't,' said Alice.

'If you can SEE whether I'm singing or not, you've sharper eyes than
most.' Humpty Dumpty remarked severely. Alice was silent.


     'In spring, when woods are getting green,
     I'll try and tell you what I mean.'


'Thank you very much,' said Alice.


     'In summer, when the days are long,
     Perhaps you'll understand the song:
     In autumn, when the leaves are brown,
     Take pen and ink, and write it down.'


'I will, if I can remember it so long,' said Alice.

'You needn't go on making remarks like that,' Humpty Dumpty said:
'they're not sensible, and they put me out.'

     'I sent a message to the fish:
     I told them "This is what I wish."

     The little fishes of the sea,
     They sent an answer back to me.

     The little fishes' answer was
     "We cannot do it, Sir, because--"'


'I'm afraid I don't quite understand,' said Alice.

'It gets easier further on,' Humpty Dumpty replied.


     'I sent to them again to say
     "It will be better to obey."

     The fishes answered with a grin,
     "Why, what a temper you are in!"

     I told them once, I told them twice:
     They would not listen to advice.

     I took a kettle large and new,
     Fit for the deed I had to do.

     My heart went hop, my heart went thump;
     I filled the kettle at the pump.

     Then some one came to me and said,
     "The little fishes are in bed."

     I said to him, I said it plain,
     "Then you must wake them up again."

     I said it very loud and clear;
     I went and shouted in his ear.'


Humpty Dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this
verse, and Alice thought with a shudder, 'I wouldn't have been the
messenger for ANYTHING!'


     'But he was very stiff and proud;
     He said "You needn't shout so loud!"

     And he was very proud and stiff;
     He said "I'd go and wake them, if--"

     I took a corkscrew from the shelf:
     I went to wake them up myself.

     And when I found the door was locked,
     I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked.

     And when I found the door was shut,
     I tried to turn the handle, but--'


There was a long pause.

'Is that all?' Alice timidly asked.

'That's all,' said Humpty Dumpty. 'Good-bye.'

This was rather sudden, Alice thought: but, after such a VERY strong
hint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would hardly be civil
to stay. So she got up, and held out her hand. 'Good-bye, till we meet
again!' she said as cheerfully as she could.

'I shouldn't know you again if we DID meet,' Humpty Dumpty replied in
a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake; 'you're so
exactly like other people.'

'The face is what one goes by, generally,' Alice remarked in a
thoughtful tone.

'That's just what I complain of,' said Humpty Dumpty. 'Your face is the
same as everybody has--the two eyes, so--' (marking their places in the
air with this thumb) 'nose in the middle, mouth under. It's always the
same. Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for
instance--or the mouth at the top--that would be SOME help.'

'It wouldn't look nice,' Alice objected. But Humpty Dumpty only shut his
eyes and said 'Wait till you've tried.'

Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he never
opened his eyes or took any further notice of her, she said 'Good-bye!'
once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away:
but she couldn't help saying to herself as she went, 'Of all the
unsatisfactory--' (she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to
have such a long word to say) 'of all the unsatisfactory people I EVER
met--' She never finished the sentence, for at this moment a heavy crash
shook the forest from end to end.




CHAPTER VII. The Lion and the Unicorn

The next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first in twos
and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in such crowds that
they seemed to fill the whole forest. Alice got behind a tree, for fear
of being run over, and watched them go by.

She thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so
uncertain on their feet: they were always tripping over something or
other, and whenever one went down, several more always fell over him, so
that the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men.

Then came the horses. Having four feet, these managed rather better than
the foot-soldiers: but even THEY stumbled now and then; and it seemed
to be a regular rule that, whenever a horse stumbled the rider fell off
instantly. The confusion got worse every moment, and Alice was very glad
to get out of the wood into an open place, where she found the White
King seated on the ground, busily writing in his memorandum-book.

'I've sent them all!' the King cried in a tone of delight, on seeing
Alice. 'Did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came
through the wood?'

'Yes, I did,' said Alice: 'several thousand, I should think.'

'Four thousand two hundred and seven, that's the exact number,' the King
said, referring to his book. 'I couldn't send all the horses, you know,
because two of them are wanted in the game. And I haven't sent the two
Messengers, either. They're both gone to the town. Just look along the
road, and tell me if you can see either of them.'

'I see nobody on the road,' said Alice.

'I only wish _I_ had such eyes,' the King remarked in a fretful tone.
'To be able to see Nobody! And at that distance, too! Why, it's as much
as _I_ can do to see real people, by this light!'

All this was lost on Alice, who was still looking intently along
the road, shading her eyes with one hand. 'I see somebody now!' she
exclaimed at last. 'But he's coming very slowly--and what curious
attitudes he goes into!' (For the messenger kept skipping up and down,
and wriggling like an eel, as he came along, with his great hands spread
out like fans on each side.)

'Not at all,' said the King. 'He's an Anglo-Saxon Messenger--and those
are Anglo-Saxon attitudes. He only does them when he's happy. His name
is Haigha.' (He pronounced it so as to rhyme with 'mayor.')

'I love my love with an H,' Alice couldn't help beginning, 'because
he is Happy. I hate him with an H, because he is Hideous. I fed him
with--with--with Ham-sandwiches and Hay. His name is Haigha, and he
lives--'

'He lives on the Hill,' the King remarked simply, without the least idea
that he was joining in the game, while Alice was still hesitating for
the name of a town beginning with H. 'The other Messenger's called
Hatta. I must have TWO, you know--to come and go. One to come, and one
to go.'

'I beg your pardon?' said Alice.

'It isn't respectable to beg,' said the King.

'I only meant that I didn't understand,' said Alice. 'Why one to come
and one to go?'

'Didn't I tell you?' the King repeated impatiently. 'I must have Two--to
fetch and carry. One to fetch, and one to carry.'

At this moment the Messenger arrived: he was far too much out of breath
to say a word, and could only wave his hands about, and make the most
fearful faces at the poor King.

'This young lady loves you with an H,' the King said, introducing Alice
in the hope of turning off the Messenger's attention from himself--but
it was no use--the Anglo-Saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary
every moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side.

'You alarm me!' said the King. 'I feel faint--Give me a ham sandwich!'

On which the Messenger, to Alice's great amusement, opened a bag that
hung round his neck, and handed a sandwich to the King, who devoured it
greedily.

'Another sandwich!' said the King.

'There's nothing but hay left now,' the Messenger said, peeping into the
bag.

'Hay, then,' the King murmured in a faint whisper.

Alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal. 'There's nothing
like eating hay when you're faint,' he remarked to her, as he munched
away.

'I should think throwing cold water over you would be better,' Alice
suggested: 'or some sal-volatile.'

'I didn't say there was nothing BETTER,' the King replied. 'I said there
was nothing LIKE it.' Which Alice did not venture to deny.

'Who did you pass on the road?' the King went on, holding out his hand
to the Messenger for some more hay.

'Nobody,' said the Messenger.

'Quite right,' said the King: 'this young lady saw him too. So of course
Nobody walks slower than you.'

'I do my best,' the Messenger said in a sulky tone. 'I'm sure nobody
walks much faster than I do!'

'He can't do that,' said the King, 'or else he'd have been here first.
However, now you've got your breath, you may tell us what's happened in
the town.'

'I'll whisper it,' said the Messenger, putting his hands to his mouth
in the shape of a trumpet, and stooping so as to get close to the King's
ear. Alice was sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news too.
However, instead of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of his
voice 'They're at it again!'

'Do you call THAT a whisper?' cried the poor King, jumping up and
shaking himself. 'If you do such a thing again, I'll have you buttered!
It went through and through my head like an earthquake!'

'It would have to be a very tiny earthquake!' thought Alice. 'Who are at
it again?' she ventured to ask.

'Why the Lion and the Unicorn, of course,' said the King.

'Fighting for the crown?'

'Yes, to be sure,' said the King: 'and the best of the joke is, that
it's MY crown all the while! Let's run and see them.' And they trotted
off, Alice repeating to herself, as she ran, the words of the old
song:--


   'The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown:
   The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town.
   Some gave them white bread, some gave them brown;
   Some gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town.'


'Does--the one--that wins--get the crown?' she asked, as well as she
could, for the run was putting her quite out of breath.

'Dear me, no!' said the King. 'What an idea!'

'Would you--be good enough,' Alice panted out, after running a little
further, 'to stop a minute--just to get--one's breath again?'

'I'm GOOD enough,' the King said, 'only I'm not strong enough. You see,
a minute goes by so fearfully quick. You might as well try to stop a
Bandersnatch!'

Alice had no more breath for talking, so they trotted on in silence,
till they came in sight of a great crowd, in the middle of which the
Lion and Unicorn were fighting. They were in such a cloud of dust, that
at first Alice could not make out which was which: but she soon managed
to distinguish the Unicorn by his horn.

They placed themselves close to where Hatta, the other messenger, was
standing watching the fight, with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece
of bread-and-butter in the other.

'He's only just out of prison, and he hadn't finished his tea when
he was sent in,' Haigha whispered to Alice: 'and they only give them
oyster-shells in there--so you see he's very hungry and thirsty. How
are you, dear child?' he went on, putting his arm affectionately round
Hatta's neck.

Hatta looked round and nodded, and went on with his bread and butter.

'Were you happy in prison, dear child?' said Haigha.

Hatta looked round once more, and this time a tear or two trickled down
his cheek: but not a word would he say.

'Speak, can't you!' Haigha cried impatiently. But Hatta only munched
away, and drank some more tea.

'Speak, won't you!' cried the King. 'How are they getting on with the
fight?'

Hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of
bread-and-butter. 'They're getting on very well,' he said in a choking
voice: 'each of them has been down about eighty-seven times.'

'Then I suppose they'll soon bring the white bread and the brown?' Alice
ventured to remark.

'It's waiting for 'em now,' said Hatta: 'this is a bit of it as I'm
eating.'

There was a pause in the fight just then, and the Lion and the Unicorn
sat down, panting, while the King called out 'Ten minutes allowed for
refreshments!' Haigha and Hatta set to work at once, carrying rough
trays of white and brown bread. Alice took a piece to taste, but it was
VERY dry.

'I don't think they'll fight any more to-day,' the King said to Hatta:
'go and order the drums to begin.' And Hatta went bounding away like a
grasshopper.

For a minute or two Alice stood silent, watching him. Suddenly she
brightened up. 'Look, look!' she cried, pointing eagerly. 'There's the
White Queen running across the country! She came flying out of the wood
over yonder--How fast those Queens CAN run!'

'There's some enemy after her, no doubt,' the King said, without even
looking round. 'That wood's full of them.'

'But aren't you going to run and help her?' Alice asked, very much
surprised at his taking it so quietly.

'No use, no use!' said the King. 'She runs so fearfully quick. You might
as well try to catch a Bandersnatch! But I'll make a memorandum about
her, if you like--She's a dear good creature,' he repeated softly to
himself, as he opened his memorandum-book. 'Do you spell "creature" with
a double "e"?'

At this moment the Unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in his
pockets. 'I had the best of it this time?' he said to the King, just
glancing at him as he passed.

'A little--a little,' the King replied, rather nervously. 'You shouldn't
have run him through with your horn, you know.'

'It didn't hurt him,' the Unicorn said carelessly, and he was going
on, when his eye happened to fall upon Alice: he turned round rather
instantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the
deepest disgust.

'What--is--this?' he said at last.

'This is a child!' Haigha replied eagerly, coming in front of Alice
to introduce her, and spreading out both his hands towards her in an
Anglo-Saxon attitude. 'We only found it to-day. It's as large as life,
and twice as natural!'

'I always thought they were fabulous monsters!' said the Unicorn. 'Is it
alive?'

'It can talk,' said Haigha, solemnly.

The Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice, and said 'Talk, child.'

Alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: 'Do
you know, I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters, too! I never
saw one alive before!'

'Well, now that we HAVE seen each other,' said the Unicorn, 'if you'll
believe in me, I'll believe in you. Is that a bargain?'

'Yes, if you like,' said Alice.

'Come, fetch out the plum-cake, old man!' the Unicorn went on, turning
from her to the King. 'None of your brown bread for me!'

'Certainly--certainly!' the King muttered, and beckoned to Haigha. 'Open
the bag!' he whispered. 'Quick! Not that one--that's full of hay!'

Haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to Alice to hold,
while he got out a dish and carving-knife. How they all came out of it
Alice couldn't guess. It was just like a conjuring-trick, she thought.

The Lion had joined them while this was going on: he looked very
tired and sleepy, and his eyes were half shut. 'What's this!' he said,
blinking lazily at Alice, and speaking in a deep hollow tone that
sounded like the tolling of a great bell.

'Ah, what IS it, now?' the Unicorn cried eagerly. 'You'll never guess!
_I_ couldn't.'

The Lion looked at Alice wearily. 'Are you animal--vegetable--or
mineral?' he said, yawning at every other word.

'It's a fabulous monster!' the Unicorn cried out, before Alice could
reply.

'Then hand round the plum-cake, Monster,' the Lion said, lying down and
putting his chin on this paws. 'And sit down, both of you,' (to the King
and the Unicorn): 'fair play with the cake, you know!'

The King was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between
the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him.

'What a fight we might have for the crown, NOW!' the Unicorn said,
looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor King was nearly shaking
off his head, he trembled so much.

'I should win easy,' said the Lion.

'I'm not so sure of that,' said the Unicorn.

'Why, I beat you all round the town, you chicken!' the Lion replied
angrily, half getting up as he spoke.

Here the King interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on: he was very
nervous, and his voice quite quivered. 'All round the town?' he
said. 'That's a good long way. Did you go by the old bridge, or the
market-place? You get the best view by the old bridge.'

'I'm sure I don't know,' the Lion growled out as he lay down again.
'There was too much dust to see anything. What a time the Monster is,
cutting up that cake!'

Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great
dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife. 'It's
very provoking!' she said, in reply to the Lion (she was getting quite
used to being called 'the Monster'). 'I've cut several slices already,
but they always join on again!'

'You don't know how to manage Looking-glass cakes,' the Unicorn
remarked. 'Hand it round first, and cut it afterwards.'

This sounded nonsense, but Alice very obediently got up, and carried the
dish round, and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so.
'NOW cut it up,' said the Lion, as she returned to her place with the
empty dish.

'I say, this isn't fair!' cried the Unicorn, as Alice sat with the knife
in her hand, very much puzzled how to begin. 'The Monster has given the
Lion twice as much as me!'

'She's kept none for herself, anyhow,' said the Lion. 'Do you like
plum-cake, Monster?'

But before Alice could answer him, the drums began.

Where the noise came from, she couldn't make out: the air seemed full
of it, and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite
deafened. She started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in
her terror,

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

and had just time to see the Lion and the Unicorn rise to their feet,
with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she dropped
to her knees, and put her hands over her ears, vainly trying to shut out
the dreadful uproar.

'If THAT doesn't "drum them out of town,"' she thought to herself,
'nothing ever will!'




CHAPTER VIII. 'It's my own Invention'

After a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all was dead
silence, and Alice lifted up her head in some alarm. There was no one
to be seen, and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming
about the Lion and the Unicorn and those queer Anglo-Saxon Messengers.
However, there was the great dish still lying at her feet, on which she
had tried to cut the plum-cake, 'So I wasn't dreaming, after all,' she
said to herself, 'unless--unless we're all part of the same dream. Only
I do hope it's MY dream, and not the Red King's! I don't like belonging
to another person's dream,' she went on in a rather complaining tone:
'I've a great mind to go and wake him, and see what happens!'

At this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of
'Ahoy! Ahoy! Check!' and a Knight dressed in crimson armour came
galloping down upon her, brandishing a great club. Just as he reached
her, the horse stopped suddenly: 'You're my prisoner!' the Knight cried,
as he tumbled off his horse.

Startled as she was, Alice was more frightened for him than for herself
at the moment, and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again.
As soon as he was comfortably in the saddle, he began once more 'You're
my--' but here another voice broke in 'Ahoy! Ahoy! Check!' and Alice
looked round in some surprise for the new enemy.

This time it was a White Knight. He drew up at Alice's side, and tumbled
off his horse just as the Red Knight had done: then he got on again,
and the two Knights sat and looked at each other for some time without
speaking. Alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment.

'She's MY prisoner, you know!' the Red Knight said at last.

'Yes, but then _I_ came and rescued her!' the White Knight replied.

'Well, we must fight for her, then,' said the Red Knight, as he took up
his helmet (which hung from the saddle, and was something the shape of a
horse's head), and put it on.

'You will observe the Rules of Battle, of course?' the White Knight
remarked, putting on his helmet too.

'I always do,' said the Red Knight, and they began banging away at each
other with such fury that Alice got behind a tree to be out of the way
of the blows.

'I wonder, now, what the Rules of Battle are,' she said to herself, as
she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her hiding-place: 'one
Rule seems to be, that if one Knight hits the other, he knocks him off
his horse, and if he misses, he tumbles off himself--and another Rule
seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms, as if they were
Punch and Judy--What a noise they make when they tumble! Just like
a whole set of fire-irons falling into the fender! And how quiet the
horses are! They let them get on and off them just as if they were
tables!'

Another Rule of Battle, that Alice had not noticed, seemed to be that
they always fell on their heads, and the battle ended with their both
falling off in this way, side by side: when they got up again, they
shook hands, and then the Red Knight mounted and galloped off.

'It was a glorious victory, wasn't it?' said the White Knight, as he
came up panting.

'I don't know,' Alice said doubtfully. 'I don't want to be anybody's
prisoner. I want to be a Queen.'

'So you will, when you've crossed the next brook,' said the White
Knight. 'I'll see you safe to the end of the wood--and then I must go
back, you know. That's the end of my move.'

'Thank you very much,' said Alice. 'May I help you off with your
helmet?' It was evidently more than he could manage by himself; however,
she managed to shake him out of it at last.

'Now one can breathe more easily,' said the Knight, putting back his
shaggy hair with both hands, and turning his gentle face and large mild
eyes to Alice. She thought she had never seen such a strange-looking
soldier in all her life.

He was dressed in tin armour, which seemed to fit him very badly, and
he had a queer-shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder,
upside-down, and with the lid hanging open. Alice looked at it with
great curiosity.

'I see you're admiring my little box.' the Knight said in a friendly
tone. 'It's my own invention--to keep clothes and sandwiches in. You see
I carry it upside-down, so that the rain can't get in.'

'But the things can get OUT,' Alice gently remarked. 'Do you know the
lid's open?'

'I didn't know it,' the Knight said, a shade of vexation passing over
his face. 'Then all the things must have fallen out! And the box is no
use without them.' He unfastened it as he spoke, and was just going to
throw it into the bushes, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him,
and he hung it carefully on a tree. 'Can you guess why I did that?' he
said to Alice.

Alice shook her head.

'In hopes some bees may make a nest in it--then I should get the honey.'

'But you've got a bee-hive--or something like one--fastened to the
saddle,' said Alice.

'Yes, it's a very good bee-hive,' the Knight said in a discontented
tone, 'one of the best kind. But not a single bee has come near it yet.
And the other thing is a mouse-trap. I suppose the mice keep the bees
out--or the bees keep the mice out, I don't know which.'

'I was wondering what the mouse-trap was for,' said Alice. 'It isn't
very likely there would be any mice on the horse's back.'

'Not very likely, perhaps,' said the Knight: 'but if they DO come, I
don't choose to have them running all about.'

'You see,' he went on after a pause, 'it's as well to be provided for
EVERYTHING. That's the reason the horse has all those anklets round his
feet.'

'But what are they for?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

'To guard against the bites of sharks,' the Knight replied. 'It's an
invention of my own. And now help me on. I'll go with you to the end of
the wood--What's the dish for?'

'It's meant for plum-cake,' said Alice.

'We'd better take it with us,' the Knight said. 'It'll come in handy if
we find any plum-cake. Help me to get it into this bag.'

This took a very long time to manage, though Alice held the bag open
very carefully, because the Knight was so VERY awkward in putting in
the dish: the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself
instead. 'It's rather a tight fit, you see,' he said, as they got it in
a last; 'There are so many candlesticks in the bag.' And he hung it
to the saddle, which was already loaded with bunches of carrots, and
fire-irons, and many other things.

'I hope you've got your hair well fastened on?' he continued, as they
set off.

'Only in the usual way,' Alice said, smiling.

'That's hardly enough,' he said, anxiously. 'You see the wind is so VERY
strong here. It's as strong as soup.'

'Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off?'
Alice enquired.

'Not yet,' said the Knight. 'But I've got a plan for keeping it from
FALLING off.'

'I should like to hear it, very much.'

'First you take an upright stick,' said the Knight. 'Then you make your
hair creep up it, like a fruit-tree. Now the reason hair falls off is
because it hangs DOWN--things never fall UPWARDS, you know. It's a plan
of my own invention. You may try it if you like.'

It didn't sound a comfortable plan, Alice thought, and for a few minutes
she walked on in silence, puzzling over the idea, and every now and then
stopping to help the poor Knight, who certainly was NOT a good rider.

Whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often), he fell off in
front; and whenever it went on again (which it generally did rather
suddenly), he fell off behind. Otherwise he kept on pretty well, except
that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways; and as he
generally did this on the side on which Alice was walking, she soon
found that it was the best plan not to walk QUITE close to the horse.

'I'm afraid you've not had much practice in riding,' she ventured to
say, as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble.

The Knight looked very much surprised, and a little offended at the
remark. 'What makes you say that?' he asked, as he scrambled back into
the saddle, keeping hold of Alice's hair with one hand, to save himself
from falling over on the other side.

'Because people don't fall off quite so often, when they've had much
practice.'

'I've had plenty of practice,' the Knight said very gravely: 'plenty of
practice!'

Alice could think of nothing better to say than 'Indeed?' but she said
it as heartily as she could. They went on a little way in silence after
this, the Knight with his eyes shut, muttering to himself, and Alice
watching anxiously for the next tumble.

'The great art of riding,' the Knight suddenly began in a loud voice,
waving his right arm as he spoke, 'is to keep--' Here the sentence ended
as suddenly as it had begun, as the Knight fell heavily on the top of
his head exactly in the path where Alice was walking. She was quite
frightened this time, and said in an anxious tone, as she picked him up,
'I hope no bones are broken?'

'None to speak of,' the Knight said, as if he didn't mind breaking two
or three of them. 'The great art of riding, as I was saying, is--to keep
your balance properly. Like this, you know--'

He let go the bridle, and stretched out both his arms to show Alice
what he meant, and this time he fell flat on his back, right under the
horse's feet.

'Plenty of practice!' he went on repeating, all the time that Alice was
getting him on his feet again. 'Plenty of practice!'

'It's too ridiculous!' cried Alice, losing all her patience this time.
'You ought to have a wooden horse on wheels, that you ought!'

'Does that kind go smoothly?' the Knight asked in a tone of great
interest, clasping his arms round the horse's neck as he spoke, just in
time to save himself from tumbling off again.

'Much more smoothly than a live horse,' Alice said, with a little scream
of laughter, in spite of all she could do to prevent it.

'I'll get one,' the Knight said thoughtfully to himself. 'One or
two--several.'

There was a short silence after this, and then the Knight went on again.
'I'm a great hand at inventing things. Now, I daresay you noticed, that
last time you picked me up, that I was looking rather thoughtful?'

'You WERE a little grave,' said Alice.

'Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gate--would
you like to hear it?'

'Very much indeed,' Alice said politely.

'I'll tell you how I came to think of it,' said the Knight. 'You see, I
said to myself, "The only difficulty is with the feet: the HEAD is high
enough already." Now, first I put my head on the top of the gate--then I
stand on my head--then the feet are high enough, you see--then I'm over,
you see.'

'Yes, I suppose you'd be over when that was done,' Alice said
thoughtfully: 'but don't you think it would be rather hard?'

'I haven't tried it yet,' the Knight said, gravely: 'so I can't tell for
certain--but I'm afraid it WOULD be a little hard.'

He looked so vexed at the idea, that Alice changed the subject hastily.
'What a curious helmet you've got!' she said cheerfully. 'Is that your
invention too?'

The Knight looked down proudly at his helmet, which hung from the
saddle. 'Yes,' he said, 'but I've invented a better one than that--like
a sugar loaf. When I used to wear it, if I fell off the horse, it always
touched the ground directly. So I had a VERY little way to fall, you
see--But there WAS the danger of falling INTO it, to be sure. That
happened to me once--and the worst of it was, before I could get out
again, the other White Knight came and put it on. He thought it was his
own helmet.'

The knight looked so solemn about it that Alice did not dare to laugh.
'I'm afraid you must have hurt him,' she said in a trembling voice,
'being on the top of his head.'

'I had to kick him, of course,' the Knight said, very seriously. 'And
then he took the helmet off again--but it took hours and hours to get me
out. I was as fast as--as lightning, you know.'

'But that's a different kind of fastness,' Alice objected.

The Knight shook his head. 'It was all kinds of fastness with me, I can
assure you!' he said. He raised his hands in some excitement as he said
this, and instantly rolled out of the saddle, and fell headlong into a
deep ditch.

Alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him. She was rather
startled by the fall, as for some time he had kept on very well, and she
was afraid that he really WAS hurt this time. However, though she could
see nothing but the soles of his feet, she was much relieved to hear
that he was talking on in his usual tone. 'All kinds of fastness,'
he repeated: 'but it was careless of him to put another man's helmet
on--with the man in it, too.'

'How CAN you go on talking so quietly, head downwards?' Alice asked, as
she dragged him out by the feet, and laid him in a heap on the bank.

The Knight looked surprised at the question. 'What does it matter where
my body happens to be?' he said. 'My mind goes on working all the same.
In fact, the more head downwards I am, the more I keep inventing new
things.'

'Now the cleverest thing of the sort that I ever did,' he went on after
a pause, 'was inventing a new pudding during the meat-course.'

'In time to have it cooked for the next course?' said Alice. 'Well,
not the NEXT course,' the Knight said in a slow thoughtful tone: 'no,
certainly not the next COURSE.'

'Then it would have to be the next day. I suppose you wouldn't have two
pudding-courses in one dinner?'

'Well, not the NEXT day,' the Knight repeated as before: 'not the next
DAY. In fact,' he went on, holding his head down, and his voice getting
lower and lower, 'I don't believe that pudding ever WAS cooked! In fact,
I don't believe that pudding ever WILL be cooked! And yet it was a very
clever pudding to invent.'

'What did you mean it to be made of?' Alice asked, hoping to cheer him
up, for the poor Knight seemed quite low-spirited about it.

'It began with blotting paper,' the Knight answered with a groan.

'That wouldn't be very nice, I'm afraid--'

'Not very nice ALONE,' he interrupted, quite eagerly: 'but you've no
idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other things--such as
gunpowder and sealing-wax. And here I must leave you.' They had just
come to the end of the wood.

Alice could only look puzzled: she was thinking of the pudding.

'You are sad,' the Knight said in an anxious tone: 'let me sing you a
song to comfort you.'

'Is it very long?' Alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of poetry
that day.

'It's long,' said the Knight, 'but very, VERY beautiful. Everybody that
hears me sing it--either it brings the TEARS into their eyes, or else--'

'Or else what?' said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden pause.

'Or else it doesn't, you know. The name of the song is called "HADDOCKS'
EYES."'

'Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?' Alice said, trying to feel
interested.

'No, you don't understand,' the Knight said, looking a little vexed.
'That's what the name is CALLED. The name really IS "THE AGED AGED
MAN."'

'Then I ought to have said "That's what the SONG is called"?' Alice
corrected herself.

'No, you oughtn't: that's quite another thing! The SONG is called "WAYS
AND MEANS": but that's only what it's CALLED, you know!'

'Well, what IS the song, then?' said Alice, who was by this time
completely bewildered.

'I was coming to that,' the Knight said. 'The song really IS "A-SITTING
ON A GATE": and the tune's my own invention.'

So saying, he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck:
then, slowly beating time with one hand, and with a faint smile lighting
up his gentle foolish face, as if he enjoyed the music of his song, he
began.

Of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The
Looking-Glass, this was the one that she always remembered most clearly.
Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again, as if it
had been only yesterday--the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the
Knight--the setting sun gleaming through his hair, and shining on his
armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled her--the horse quietly
moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the
grass at her feet--and the black shadows of the forest behind--all this
she took in like a picture, as, with one hand shading her eyes, she
leant against a tree, watching the strange pair, and listening, in a
half dream, to the melancholy music of the song.

'But the tune ISN'T his own invention,' she said to herself: 'it's "I
GIVE THEE ALL, I CAN NO MORE."' She stood and listened very attentively,
but no tears came into her eyes.


     'I'll tell thee everything I can;
      There's little to relate.
     I saw an aged aged man,
      A-sitting on a gate.
     "Who are you, aged man?" I said,
      "and how is it you live?"
     And his answer trickled through my head
      Like water through a sieve.

     He said "I look for butterflies
      That sleep among the wheat:
     I make them into mutton-pies,
      And sell them in the street.
     I sell them unto men," he said,
      "Who sail on stormy seas;
     And that's the way I get my bread--
      A trifle, if you please."

     But I was thinking of a plan
      To dye one's whiskers green,
     And always use so large a fan
      That they could not be seen.
     So, having no reply to give
      To what the old man said,
     I cried, "Come, tell me how you live!"
      And thumped him on the head.

     His accents mild took up the tale:
      He said "I go my ways,
     And when I find a mountain-rill,
      I set it in a blaze;
     And thence they make a stuff they call
      Rolands' Macassar Oil--
     Yet twopence-halfpenny is all
      They give me for my toil."

     But I was thinking of a way
      To feed oneself on batter,
     And so go on from day to day
      Getting a little fatter.
     I shook him well from side to side,
      Until his face was blue:
     "Come, tell me how you live," I cried,
      "And what it is you do!"

     He said "I hunt for haddocks' eyes
      Among the heather bright,
     And work them into waistcoat-buttons
      In the silent night.
     And these I do not sell for gold
      Or coin of silvery shine
     But for a copper halfpenny,
      And that will purchase nine.

     "I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,
      Or set limed twigs for crabs;
     I sometimes search the grassy knolls
      For wheels of Hansom-cabs.
     And that's the way" (he gave a wink)
      "By which I get my wealth--
     And very gladly will I drink
      Your Honour's noble health."

     I heard him then, for I had just
      Completed my design
     To keep the Menai bridge from rust
      By boiling it in wine.
     I thanked him much for telling me
      The way he got his wealth,
     But chiefly for his wish that he
      Might drink my noble health.

     And now, if e'er by chance I put
      My fingers into glue
     Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
      Into a left-hand shoe,
     Or if I drop upon my toe
      A very heavy weight,
     I weep, for it reminds me so,
      Of that old man I used to know--

     Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow,
     Whose hair was whiter than the snow,
     Whose face was very like a crow,
     With eyes, like cinders, all aglow,
     Who seemed distracted with his woe,
     Who rocked his body to and fro,
     And muttered mumblingly and low,
     As if his mouth were full of dough,
     Who snorted like a buffalo--
     That summer evening, long ago,
      A-sitting on a gate.'


As the Knight sang the last words of the ballad, he gathered up the
reins, and turned his horse's head along the road by which they had
come. 'You've only a few yards to go,' he said, 'down the hill and over
that little brook, and then you'll be a Queen--But you'll stay and
see me off first?' he added as Alice turned with an eager look in the
direction to which he pointed. 'I shan't be long. You'll wait and wave
your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the road? I think it'll
encourage me, you see.'

'Of course I'll wait,' said Alice: 'and thank you very much for coming
so far--and for the song--I liked it very much.'

'I hope so,' the Knight said doubtfully: 'but you didn't cry so much as
I thought you would.'

So they shook hands, and then the Knight rode slowly away into the
forest. 'It won't take long to see him OFF, I expect,' Alice said to
herself, as she stood watching him. 'There he goes! Right on his head as
usual! However, he gets on again pretty easily--that comes of having so
many things hung round the horse--' So she went on talking to herself,
as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and the
Knight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other. After
the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn, and then she waved her
handkerchief to him, and waited till he was out of sight.

'I hope it encouraged him,' she said, as she turned to run down the
hill: 'and now for the last brook, and to be a Queen! How grand it
sounds!' A very few steps brought her to the edge of the brook. 'The
Eighth Square at last!' she cried as she bounded across,

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

and threw herself down to rest on a lawn as soft as moss, with little
flower-beds dotted about it here and there. 'Oh, how glad I am to get
here! And what IS this on my head?' she exclaimed in a tone of dismay,
as she put her hands up to something very heavy, and fitted tight all
round her head.

'But how CAN it have got there without my knowing it?' she said to
herself, as she lifted it off, and set it on her lap to make out what it
could possibly be.

It was a golden crown.




CHAPTER IX. Queen Alice

'Well, this IS grand!' said Alice. 'I never expected I should be a Queen
so soon--and I'll tell you what it is, your majesty,' she went on in
a severe tone (she was always rather fond of scolding herself), 'it'll
never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that! Queens have
to be dignified, you know!'

So she got up and walked about--rather stiffly just at first, as she was
afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with the
thought that there was nobody to see her, 'and if I really am a Queen,'
she said as she sat down again, 'I shall be able to manage it quite well
in time.'

Everything was happening so oddly that she didn't feel a bit surprised
at finding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close to her, one
on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came
there, but she feared it would not be quite civil. However, there would
be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over. 'Please, would
you tell me--' she began, looking timidly at the Red Queen.

'Speak when you're spoken to!' The Queen sharply interrupted her.

'But if everybody obeyed that rule,' said Alice, who was always ready
for a little argument, 'and if you only spoke when you were spoken to,
and the other person always waited for YOU to begin, you see nobody
would ever say anything, so that--'

'Ridiculous!' cried the Queen. 'Why, don't you see, child--' here she
broke off with a frown, and, after thinking for a minute, suddenly
changed the subject of the conversation. 'What do you mean by "If you
really are a Queen"? What right have you to call yourself so? You can't
be a Queen, you know, till you've passed the proper examination. And the
sooner we begin it, the better.'

'I only said "if"!' poor Alice pleaded in a piteous tone.

The two Queens looked at each other, and the Red Queen remarked, with a
little shudder, 'She SAYS she only said "if"--'

'But she said a great deal more than that!' the White Queen moaned,
wringing her hands. 'Oh, ever so much more than that!'

'So you did, you know,' the Red Queen said to Alice. 'Always speak the
truth--think before you speak--and write it down afterwards.'

'I'm sure I didn't mean--' Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen
interrupted her impatiently.

'That's just what I complain of! You SHOULD have meant! What do you
suppose is the use of child without any meaning? Even a joke should
have some meaning--and a child's more important than a joke, I hope. You
couldn't deny that, even if you tried with both hands.'

'I don't deny things with my HANDS,' Alice objected.

'Nobody said you did,' said the Red Queen. 'I said you couldn't if you
tried.'

'She's in that state of mind,' said the White Queen, 'that she wants to
deny SOMETHING--only she doesn't know what to deny!'

'A nasty, vicious temper,' the Red Queen remarked; and then there was an
uncomfortable silence for a minute or two.

The Red Queen broke the silence by saying to the White Queen, 'I invite
you to Alice's dinner-party this afternoon.'

The White Queen smiled feebly, and said 'And I invite YOU.'

'I didn't know I was to have a party at all,' said Alice; 'but if there
is to be one, I think _I_ ought to invite the guests.'

'We gave you the opportunity of doing it,' the Red Queen remarked: 'but
I daresay you've not had many lessons in manners yet?'

'Manners are not taught in lessons,' said Alice. 'Lessons teach you to
do sums, and things of that sort.'

'And you do Addition?' the White Queen asked. 'What's one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?'

'I don't know,' said Alice. 'I lost count.'

'She can't do Addition,' the Red Queen interrupted. 'Can you do
Subtraction? Take nine from eight.'

'Nine from eight I can't, you know,' Alice replied very readily: 'but--'

'She can't do Subtraction,' said the White Queen. 'Can you do Division?
Divide a loaf by a knife--what's the answer to that?'

'I suppose--' Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen answered for her.
'Bread-and-butter, of course. Try another Subtraction sum. Take a bone
from a dog: what remains?'

Alice considered. 'The bone wouldn't remain, of course, if I took
it--and the dog wouldn't remain; it would come to bite me--and I'm sure
I shouldn't remain!'

'Then you think nothing would remain?' said the Red Queen.

'I think that's the answer.'

'Wrong, as usual,' said the Red Queen: 'the dog's temper would remain.'

'But I don't see how--'

'Why, look here!' the Red Queen cried. 'The dog would lose its temper,
wouldn't it?'

'Perhaps it would,' Alice replied cautiously.

'Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain!' the Queen
exclaimed triumphantly.

Alice said, as gravely as she could, 'They might go different ways.' But
she couldn't help thinking to herself, 'What dreadful nonsense we ARE
talking!'

'She can't do sums a BIT!' the Queens said together, with great
emphasis.

'Can YOU do sums?' Alice said, turning suddenly on the White Queen, for
she didn't like being found fault with so much.

The Queen gasped and shut her eyes. 'I can do Addition, if you give me
time--but I can't do Subtraction, under ANY circumstances!'

'Of course you know your A B C?' said the Red Queen.

'To be sure I do.' said Alice.

'So do I,' the White Queen whispered: 'we'll often say it over together,
dear. And I'll tell you a secret--I can read words of one letter! Isn't
THAT grand! However, don't be discouraged. You'll come to it in time.'

Here the Red Queen began again. 'Can you answer useful questions?' she
said. 'How is bread made?'

'I know THAT!' Alice cried eagerly. 'You take some flour--'

'Where do you pick the flower?' the White Queen asked. 'In a garden, or
in the hedges?'

'Well, it isn't PICKED at all,' Alice explained: 'it's GROUND--'

'How many acres of ground?' said the White Queen. 'You mustn't leave out
so many things.'

'Fan her head!' the Red Queen anxiously interrupted. 'She'll be feverish
after so much thinking.' So they set to work and fanned her with bunches
of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave off, it blew her hair about
so.

'She's all right again now,' said the Red Queen. 'Do you know Languages?
What's the French for fiddle-de-dee?'

'Fiddle-de-dee's not English,' Alice replied gravely.

'Who ever said it was?' said the Red Queen.

Alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. 'If you'll
tell me what language "fiddle-de-dee" is, I'll tell you the French for
it!' she exclaimed triumphantly.

But the Red Queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said 'Queens never
make bargains.'

'I wish Queens never asked questions,' Alice thought to herself.

'Don't let us quarrel,' the White Queen said in an anxious tone. 'What
is the cause of lightning?'

'The cause of lightning,' Alice said very decidedly, for she felt quite
certain about this, 'is the thunder--no, no!' she hastily corrected
herself. 'I meant the other way.'

'It's too late to correct it,' said the Red Queen: 'when you've once
said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences.'

'Which reminds me--' the White Queen said, looking down and nervously
clasping and unclasping her hands, 'we had SUCH a thunderstorm last
Tuesday--I mean one of the last set of Tuesdays, you know.'

Alice was puzzled. 'In OUR country,' she remarked, 'there's only one day
at a time.'

The Red Queen said, 'That's a poor thin way of doing things. Now HERE,
we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and sometimes
in the winter we take as many as five nights together--for warmth, you
know.'

'Are five nights warmer than one night, then?' Alice ventured to ask.

'Five times as warm, of course.'

'But they should be five times as COLD, by the same rule--'

'Just so!' cried the Red Queen. 'Five times as warm, AND five times
as cold--just as I'm five times as rich as you are, AND five times as
clever!'

Alice sighed and gave it up. 'It's exactly like a riddle with no
answer!' she thought.

'Humpty Dumpty saw it too,' the White Queen went on in a low voice, more
as if she were talking to herself. 'He came to the door with a corkscrew
in his hand--'

'What did he want?' said the Red Queen.

'He said he WOULD come in,' the White Queen went on, 'because he was
looking for a hippopotamus. Now, as it happened, there wasn't such a
thing in the house, that morning.'

'Is there generally?' Alice asked in an astonished tone.

'Well, only on Thursdays,' said the Queen.

'I know what he came for,' said Alice: 'he wanted to punish the fish,
because--'

Here the White Queen began again. 'It was SUCH a thunderstorm, you can't
think!' ('She NEVER could, you know,' said the Red Queen.) 'And part of
the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got in--and it went
rolling round the room in great lumps--and knocking over the tables and
things--till I was so frightened, I couldn't remember my own name!'

Alice thought to herself, 'I never should TRY to remember my name in the
middle of an accident! Where would be the use of it?' but she did not
say this aloud, for fear of hurting the poor Queen's feeling.

'Your Majesty must excuse her,' the Red Queen said to Alice, taking
one of the White Queen's hands in her own, and gently stroking it:
'she means well, but she can't help saying foolish things, as a general
rule.'

The White Queen looked timidly at Alice, who felt she OUGHT to say
something kind, but really couldn't think of anything at the moment.

'She never was really well brought up,' the Red Queen went on: 'but
it's amazing how good-tempered she is! Pat her on the head, and see how
pleased she'll be!' But this was more than Alice had courage to do.

'A little kindness--and putting her hair in papers--would do wonders
with her--'

The White Queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on Alice's shoulder.
'I AM so sleepy?' she moaned.

'She's tired, poor thing!' said the Red Queen. 'Smooth her hair--lend
her your nightcap--and sing her a soothing lullaby.'

'I haven't got a nightcap with me,' said Alice, as she tried to obey the
first direction: 'and I don't know any soothing lullabies.'

'I must do it myself, then,' said the Red Queen, and she began:


   'Hush-a-by lady, in Alice's lap!
   Till the feast's ready, we've time for a nap:
   When the feast's over, we'll go to the ball--
   Red Queen, and White Queen, and Alice, and all!


'And now you know the words,' she added, as she put her head down on
Alice's other shoulder, 'just sing it through to ME. I'm getting sleepy,
too.' In another moment both Queens were fast asleep, and snoring loud.

'What AM I to do?' exclaimed Alice, looking about in great perplexity,
as first one round head, and then the other, rolled down from her
shoulder, and lay like a heavy lump in her lap. 'I don't think it EVER
happened before, that any one had to take care of two Queens asleep
at once! No, not in all the History of England--it couldn't, you know,
because there never was more than one Queen at a time. Do wake up, you
heavy things!' she went on in an impatient tone; but there was no answer
but a gentle snoring.

The snoring got more distinct every minute, and sounded more like a
tune: at last she could even make out the words, and she listened so
eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she hardly
missed them.

She was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words
QUEEN ALICE in large letters, and on each side of the arch there was a
bell-handle; one was marked 'Visitors' Bell,' and the other 'Servants'
Bell.'

'I'll wait till the song's over,' thought Alice, 'and then I'll
ring--the--WHICH bell must I ring?' she went on, very much puzzled by
the names. 'I'm not a visitor, and I'm not a servant. There OUGHT to be
one marked "Queen," you know--'

Just then the door opened a little way, and a creature with a long beak
put its head out for a moment and said 'No admittance till the week
after next!' and shut the door again with a bang.

Alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time, but at last, a very old
Frog, who was sitting under a tree, got up and hobbled slowly towards
her: he was dressed in bright yellow, and had enormous boots on.

'What is it, now?' the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.

Alice turned round, ready to find fault with anybody. 'Where's the
servant whose business it is to answer the door?' she began angrily.

'Which door?' said the Frog.

Alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he
spoke. 'THIS door, of course!'

The Frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute:
then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb, as if he were trying
whether the paint would come off; then he looked at Alice.

'To answer the door?' he said. 'What's it been asking of?' He was so
hoarse that Alice could scarcely hear him.

'I don't know what you mean,' she said.

'I talks English, doesn't I?' the Frog went on. 'Or are you deaf? What
did it ask you?'

'Nothing!' Alice said impatiently. 'I've been knocking at it!'

'Shouldn't do that--shouldn't do that--' the Frog muttered. 'Vexes it,
you know.' Then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his
great feet. 'You let IT alone,' he panted out, as he hobbled back to his
tree, 'and it'll let YOU alone, you know.'

At this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice was heard
singing:


   'To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said,
   "I've a sceptre in hand, I've a crown on my head;
   Let the Looking-Glass creatures, whatever they be,
   Come and dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me."'


And hundreds of voices joined in the chorus:


  'Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can,
  And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran:
  Put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea--
  And welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three!'


Then followed a confused noise of cheering, and Alice thought to
herself, 'Thirty times three makes ninety. I wonder if any one's
counting?' In a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill
voice sang another verse;


  '"O Looking-Glass creatures," quoth Alice, "draw near!
  'Tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear:
  'Tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea
  Along with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!"'


Then came the chorus again:--


  'Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink,
  Or anything else that is pleasant to drink:
  Mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine--
  And welcome Queen Alice with ninety-times-nine!'


'Ninety times nine!' Alice repeated in despair, 'Oh, that'll never
be done! I'd better go in at once--' and there was a dead silence the
moment she appeared.

Alice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up the large
hall, and noticed that there were about fifty guests, of all kinds: some
were animals, some birds, and there were even a few flowers among them.
'I'm glad they've come without waiting to be asked,' she thought: 'I
should never have known who were the right people to invite!'

There were three chairs at the head of the table; the Red and White
Queens had already taken two of them, but the middle one was empty.
Alice sat down in it, rather uncomfortable in the silence, and longing
for some one to speak.

At last the Red Queen began. 'You've missed the soup and fish,' she
said. 'Put on the joint!' And the waiters set a leg of mutton before
Alice, who looked at it rather anxiously, as she had never had to carve
a joint before.

'You look a little shy; let me introduce you to that leg of mutton,'
said the Red Queen. 'Alice--Mutton; Mutton--Alice.' The leg of mutton
got up in the dish and made a little bow to Alice; and Alice returned
the bow, not knowing whether to be frightened or amused.

'May I give you a slice?' she said, taking up the knife and fork, and
looking from one Queen to the other.

'Certainly not,' the Red Queen said, very decidedly: 'it isn't etiquette
to cut any one you've been introduced to. Remove the joint!' And the
waiters carried it off, and brought a large plum-pudding in its place.

'I won't be introduced to the pudding, please,' Alice said rather
hastily, 'or we shall get no dinner at all. May I give you some?'

But the Red Queen looked sulky, and growled 'Pudding--Alice;
Alice--Pudding. Remove the pudding!' and the waiters took it away so
quickly that Alice couldn't return its bow.

However, she didn't see why the Red Queen should be the only one to give
orders, so, as an experiment, she called out 'Waiter! Bring back the
pudding!' and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring-trick. It
was so large that she couldn't help feeling a LITTLE shy with it, as she
had been with the mutton; however, she conquered her shyness by a great
effort and cut a slice and handed it to the Red Queen.

'What impertinence!' said the Pudding. 'I wonder how you'd like it, if I
were to cut a slice out of YOU, you creature!'

It spoke in a thick, suety sort of voice, and Alice hadn't a word to say
in reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp.

'Make a remark,' said the Red Queen: 'it's ridiculous to leave all the
conversation to the pudding!'

'Do you know, I've had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me to-day,'
Alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment she opened
her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed upon her; 'and
it's a very curious thing, I think--every poem was about fishes in some
way. Do you know why they're so fond of fishes, all about here?'

She spoke to the Red Queen, whose answer was a little wide of the mark.
'As to fishes,' she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her mouth
close to Alice's ear, 'her White Majesty knows a lovely riddle--all in
poetry--all about fishes. Shall she repeat it?'

'Her Red Majesty's very kind to mention it,' the White Queen murmured
into Alice's other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon. 'It
would be SUCH a treat! May I?'

'Please do,' Alice said very politely.

The White Queen laughed with delight, and stroked Alice's cheek. Then
she began:


    '"First, the fish must be caught."
  That is easy: a baby, I think, could have caught it.
    "Next, the fish must be bought."
  That is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it.

    "Now cook me the fish!"
  That is easy, and will not take more than a minute.
    "Let it lie in a dish!"
  That is easy, because it already is in it.

    "Bring it here! Let me sup!"
  It is easy to set such a dish on the table.
    "Take the dish-cover up!"
  Ah, THAT is so hard that I fear I'm unable!

    For it holds it like glue--
  Holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle:
    Which is easiest to do,
  Un-dish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle?'


'Take a minute to think about it, and then guess,' said the Red Queen.
'Meanwhile, we'll drink your health--Queen Alice's health!' she screamed
at the top of her voice, and all the guests began drinking it directly,
and very queerly they managed it: some of them put their glasses upon
their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that trickled down their
faces--others upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off
the edges of the table--and three of them (who looked like kangaroos)
scrambled into the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping up
the gravy, 'just like pigs in a trough!' thought Alice.

'You ought to return thanks in a neat speech,' the Red Queen said,
frowning at Alice as she spoke.

'We must support you, you know,' the White Queen whispered, as Alice got
up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened.

'Thank you very much,' she whispered in reply, 'but I can do quite well
without.'

'That wouldn't be at all the thing,' the Red Queen said very decidedly:
so Alice tried to submit to it with a good grace.

('And they DID push so!' she said afterwards, when she was telling her
sister the history of the feast. 'You would have thought they wanted to
squeeze me flat!')

In fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she
made her speech: the two Queens pushed her so, one on each side, that
they nearly lifted her up into the air: 'I rise to return thanks--'
Alice began: and she really DID rise as she spoke, several inches; but
she got hold of the edge of the table, and managed to pull herself down
again.

'Take care of yourself!' screamed the White Queen, seizing Alice's hair
with both her hands. 'Something's going to happen!'

And then (as Alice afterwards described it) all sorts of things happened
in a moment. The candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking something
like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. As to the bottles, they
each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and
so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions: 'and
very like birds they look,' Alice thought to herself, as well as she
could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning.

At this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side, and turned to see
what was the matter with the White Queen; but, instead of the Queen,
there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair. 'Here I am!' cried a
voice from the soup tureen, and Alice turned again, just in time to see
the Queen's broad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over
the edge of the tureen, before she disappeared into the soup.

There was not a moment to be lost. Already several of the guests were
lying down in the dishes, and the soup ladle was walking up the table
towards Alice's chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of
its way.

'I can't stand this any longer!' she cried as she jumped up and seized
the table-cloth with both hands: one good pull, and plates, dishes,
guests, and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor.

'And as for YOU,' she went on, turning fiercely upon the Red Queen, whom
she considered as the cause of all the mischief--but the Queen was no
longer at her side--she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a
little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round
after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her.

At any other time, Alice would have felt surprised at this, but she was
far too much excited to be surprised at anything NOW. 'As for YOU,'
she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of
jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table, 'I'll shake
you into a kitten, that I will!'




CHAPTER X. Shaking

She took her off the table as she spoke, and shook her backwards and
forwards with all her might.

The Red Queen made no resistance whatever; only her face grew very
small, and her eyes got large and green: and still, as Alice went on
shaking her, she kept on growing shorter--and fatter--and softer--and
rounder--and--




CHAPTER XI. Waking

--and it really WAS a kitten, after all.




CHAPTER XII. Which Dreamed it?

'Your majesty shouldn't purr so loud,' Alice said, rubbing her eyes, and
addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some severity. 'You
woke me out of oh! such a nice dream! And you've been along with me,
Kitty--all through the Looking-Glass world. Did you know it, dear?'

It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made the
remark) that, whatever you say to them, they ALWAYS purr. 'If they would
only purr for "yes" and mew for "no," or any rule of that sort,' she had
said, 'so that one could keep up a conversation! But how CAN you talk
with a person if they always say the same thing?'

On this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess
whether it meant 'yes' or 'no.'

So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the
Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put
the kitten and the Queen to look at each other. 'Now, Kitty!' she cried,
clapping her hands triumphantly. 'Confess that was what you turned
into!'

('But it wouldn't look at it,' she said, when she was explaining the
thing afterwards to her sister: 'it turned away its head, and pretended
not to see it: but it looked a LITTLE ashamed of itself, so I think it
MUST have been the Red Queen.')

'Sit up a little more stiffly, dear!' Alice cried with a merry laugh.
'And curtsey while you're thinking what to--what to purr. It saves time,
remember!' And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, 'just in
honour of having been a Red Queen.'

'Snowdrop, my pet!' she went on, looking over her shoulder at the White
Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, 'when WILL
Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder? That must be the
reason you were so untidy in my dream--Dinah! do you know that you're
scrubbing a White Queen? Really, it's most disrespectful of you!

'And what did DINAH turn to, I wonder?' she prattled on, as she settled
comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her hand,
to watch the kittens. 'Tell me, Dinah, did you turn to Humpty Dumpty? I
THINK you did--however, you'd better not mention it to your friends just
yet, for I'm not sure.

'By the way, Kitty, if only you'd been really with me in my dream, there
was one thing you WOULD have enjoyed--I had such a quantity of poetry
said to me, all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall have a real
treat. All the time you're eating your breakfast, I'll repeat "The
Walrus and the Carpenter" to you; and then you can make believe it's
oysters, dear!

'Now, Kitty, let's consider who it was that dreamed it all. This is a
serious question, my dear, and you should NOT go on licking your paw
like that--as if Dinah hadn't washed you this morning! You see, Kitty,
it MUST have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my dream,
of course--but then I was part of his dream, too! WAS it the Red King,
Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know--Oh, Kitty, DO
help to settle it! I'm sure your paw can wait!' But the provoking kitten
only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn't heard the question.

Which do YOU think it was?


              ----


         A boat beneath a sunny sky,
         Lingering onward dreamily
         In an evening of July--

         Children three that nestle near,
         Eager eye and willing ear,
         Pleased a simple tale to hear--

         Long has paled that sunny sky:
         Echoes fade and memories die.
         Autumn frosts have slain July.

         Still she haunts me, phantomwise,
         Alice moving under skies
         Never seen by waking eyes.

         Children yet, the tale to hear,
         Eager eye and willing ear,
         Lovingly shall nestle near.

         In a Wonderland they lie,
         Dreaming as the days go by,
         Dreaming as the summers die:

         Ever drifting down the stream--
         Lingering in the golden gleam--
         Life, what is it but a dream?

PREFACE TO THE POEMS.


The text of the present issue of Lord Byron's Poetical Works is based on
that of 'The Works of Lord Byron', in six volumes, 12mo, which was
published by John Murray in 1831. That edition followed the text of the
successive issues of plays and poems which appeared in the author's
lifetime, and were subject to his own revision, or that of Gifford and
other accredited readers. A more or less thorough collation of the
printed volumes with the MSS. which were at Moore's disposal, yielded a
number of variorum readings which have appeared in subsequent editions
published by John Murray. Fresh collations of the text of individual
poems with the original MSS. have been made from time to time, with the
result that the text of the latest edition (one-vol. 8vo, 1891) includes
some emendations, and has been supplemented by additional variants.
Textual errors of more or less importance, which had crept into the
numerous editions which succeeded the seventeen-volume edition of 1832,
were in some instances corrected, but in others passed over. For the
purposes of the present edition the printed text has been collated with
all the MSS. which passed through Moore's hands, and, also, for the
first time, with MSS. of the following plays and poems, viz. 'English
Bards, and Scotch Reviewers'; 'Childe Harold', Canto IV.; 'Don Juan',
Cantos VI.-XVI.; 'Werner'; 'The Deformed Transformed'; 'Lara';
'Parisina'; 'The Prophecy of Dante'; 'The Vision of Judgment'; 'The Age
of Bronze'; 'The Island'. The only works of any importance which have
been printed directly from the text of the first edition, without
reference to the MSS., are the following, which appeared in 'The
Liberal' (1822-23), viz.: 'Heaven and Earth', 'The Blues', and 'Morgante
Maggiore'.

A new and, it is believed, an improved punctuation has been adopted. In
this respect Byron did not profess to prepare his MSS. for the press,
and the punctuation, for which Gifford is mainly responsible, has been
reconsidered with reference solely to the meaning and interpretation of
the sentences as they occur.

In the 'Hours of Idleness and Other Early Poems', the typography of the
first four editions, as a rule, has been preserved. A uniform typography
in accordance with modern use has been adopted for all poems of later
date. Variants, being the readings of one or more MSS. or of successive
editions, are printed in italics [as footnotes. text Ed] immediately
below the text. They are marked by Roman numerals. Words and lines
through which the author has drawn his pen in the MSS. or Revises are
marked 'MS. erased'.

Poems and plays are given, so far as possible, in chronological order.
'Childe Harold' and 'Don Juan', which were written and published in
parts, are printed continuously; and minor poems, including the first
four satires, have been arranged in groups according to the date of
composition. Epigrams and 'jeux d'esprit' have been placed together, in
chronological order, towards the end of the sixth volume. A Bibliography
of the poems will immediately precede the Index at the close of the
sixth volume.

The edition contains at least thirty hitherto unpublished poems,
including fifteen stanzas of the unfinished seventeenth canto of 'Don
Juan', and a considerable fragment of the third part of 'The Deformed
Transformed'. The eleven unpublished poems from MSS. preserved at
Newstead, which appear in the first volume, are of slight if any
literary value, but they reflect with singular clearness and sincerity
the temper and aspirations of the tumultuous and moody stripling to whom
"the numbers came," but who wisely abstained from printing them himself.

Byron's notes, of which many are published for the first time, and
editorial notes, enclosed in brackets, are printed immediately below the
variorum readings. The editorial notes are designed solely to supply the
reader with references to passages in other works illustrative of the
text, or to interpret expressions and allusions which lapse of time may
have rendered obscure.

Much of the knowledge requisite for this purpose is to be found in the
articles of the 'Dictionary of National Biography', to which the fullest
acknowledgments are due; and much has been arrived at after long
research, involving a minute examination of the literature, the
magazines, and often the newspapers of the period.

Inasmuch as the poems and plays have been before the public for more
than three quarters of a century, it has not been thought necessary to
burden the notes with the eulogies and apologies of the great poets and
critics who were Byron's contemporaries, and regarded his writings, both
for good and evil, for praise and blame, from a different standpoint
from ours. Perhaps, even yet, the time has not come for a definite and
positive appreciation of his genius. The tide of feeling and opinion
must ebb and flow many times before his rank and station among the poets
of all time will be finally adjudged. The splendour of his reputation,
which dazzled his own countrymen, and, for the first time, attracted the
attention of a contemporary European audience to an English writer, has
faded, and belongs to history; but the poet's work remains, inviting a
more intimate and a more extended scrutiny than it has hitherto received
in this country. The reader who cares to make himself acquainted with
the method of Byron's workmanship, to unravel his allusions, and to
follow the tenour of his verse, will, it is hoped, find some assistance
in these volumes.

I beg to record my especial thanks to the Earl of Lovelace for the use
of MSS. of his grandfather's poems, including unpublished fragments; for
permission to reproduce portraits in his possession; and for valuable
information and direction in the construction of some of the notes.

My grateful acknowledgments are due to Dr. Garnett, C.B., Dr. A. H.
Murray, Mr. R. E. Graves, and other officials of the British Museum, for
invaluable assistance in preparing the notes, and in compiling a
bibliography of the poems.

I have also to thank Mr. Leslie Stephen and others for important hints
and suggestions with regard to the interpretation of some obscure
passages in 'Hints from Horace'.

In correcting the proofs for the press, I have had the advantage of the
skill and knowledge of my friend Mr. Frank E. Taylor, of Chertsey, to
whom my thanks are due.

On behalf of the Publisher, I beg to acknowledge with gratitude the
kindness of the Lady Dorchester, the Earl Stanhope, Lord Glenesk and Sir
Theodore Martin, K.C.B., for permission to examine MSS. in their
possession; and of Mrs. Chaworth Musters, for permission to reproduce
her miniature of Miss Chaworth, and for other favours. He desires also
to acknowledge the generous assistance of Mr. and Miss Webb, of Newstead
Abbey, in permitting the publication of MS. poems, and in making
transcripts for the press.

I need hardly add that, throughout the progress of the work, the advice
and direct assistance of Mr. John Murray and Mr. R. E. Prothero have
been always within my reach. They have my cordial thanks.

The only Apology necessary to be adduced, in extenuation of any errors
in the following collection, is, that the Author has not yet completed
his nineteenth year.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE TO 'HOURS OF IDLENESS AND OTHER EARLY POEMS'.

There were four distinct issues of Byron's Juvenilia. The first
collection, entitled 'Fugitive Pieces', was printed in quarto by S. and
J. Ridge of Newark. Two of the poems, "The Tear" and the "Reply to Some
Verses of J. M. B. Pigot, Esq.," were signed "BYRON;" but the volume
itself, which is without a title-page, was anonymous. It numbers
sixty-six pages, and consists of thirty-eight distinct pieces. The last
piece, "Imitated from Catullus. To Anna," is dated November 16, 1806.
The whole of this issue, with the exception of two or three copies, was
destroyed. An imperfect copy, lacking pp. 17-20 and pp. 58-66, is
preserved at Newstead. A perfect copy, which had been retained by the
Rev. J. T. Becher, at whose instance the issue was suppressed, was
preserved by his family (see 'Life', by Karl Elze, 1872, p. 450), and is
now in the possession of Mr. H. Buxton Forman, C.B. A facsimile reprint
of this unique volume, limited to one hundred copies, was issued, for
private circulation only, from the Chiswick Press in 1886.

Of the thirty-eight 'Fugitive Pieces', two poems, viz. "To Caroline" and
"To Mary," together with the last six stanzas of the lines, "To Miss E.
P. [To Eliza]," have never been republished in any edition of Byron's
Poetical Works.

A second edition, small octavo, of 'Fugitive Pieces', entitled 'Poems on
Various Occasions', was printed by S. and J. Ridge of Newark, and
distributed in January, 1807. This volume was issued anonymously. It
numbers 144 pages, and consists of a reproduction of thirty-six
'Fugitive Pieces', and of twelve hitherto unprinted poems--forty-eight
in all. For references to the distribution of this issue--limited, says
Moore, to one hundred copies--see letters to Mr. Pigot and the Earl of
Clare, dated January 16, February 6, 1807, and undated letters of the
same period to Mr. William Bankes and Mr. Falkner ('Life', pp. 41, 42).
The annotated copy of 'Poems on Various Occasions', referred to in the
present edition, is in the British Museum.

Early in the summer (June--July) of 1807, a volume, small octavo, named
'Hours of Idleness'--a title henceforth associated with Byron's early
poems--was printed and published by S. and J. Ridge of Newark, and was
sold by the following London booksellers: Crosby and Co.; Longman,
Hurst, Rees, and Orme; F. and C. Rivington; and J, Mawman. The full
title is, 'Hours of Idleness; a Series of Poems Original and
Translated'. By George Gordon, Lord Byron, a Minor. It numbers 187
pages, and consists of thirty-nine poems. Of these, nineteen belonged to
the original 'Fugitive Pieces', eight had first appeared in 'Poems on
Various Occasions', and twelve were published for the first time. The
"Fragment of a Translation from the 9th Book of Virgil's Æneid"
('sic'), numbering sixteen lines, reappears as "The Episode of Nisus and
Euryalus, A Paraphrase from the Æneid, Lib. 9," numbering 406 lines.

The final collection, also in small octavo, bearing the title 'Poems
Original and Translated', by George Gordon, Lord Byron, second edition,
was printed and published in 1808 by S. and J. Ridge of Newark, and sold
by the same London booksellers as 'Hours of Idleness'. It numbers 174
pages, and consists of seventeen of the original 'Fugitive Pieces', four
of those first published in 'Poems on Various Occasions', a reprint of
the twelve poems first published in 'Hours of Idleness', and five poems
which now appeared for the first time--thirty-eight poems in all.
Neither the title nor the contents of this so-called second edition
corresponds exactly with the previous issue.

Of the thirty-eight 'Fugitive Pieces' which constitute the suppressed
quarto, only seventeen appear in all three subsequent issues. Of the
twelve additions to 'Poems on Various Occasions', four were excluded
from 'Hours of Idleness', and four more from 'Poems Original and
Translated'.

The collection of minor poems entitled 'Hours of Idleness', which has
been included in every edition of Byron's Poetical Works issued by John
Murray since 1831, consists of seventy pieces, being the aggregate of
the poems published in the three issues, 'Poems on Various Occasions',
'Hours of Idleness', and 'Poems Original and Translated', together with
five other poems of the same period derived from other sources.

In the present issue a general heading, "Hours of Idleness, and other
Early Poems," has been applied to the entire collection of Early Poems,
1802-1809. The quarto has been reprinted (excepting the lines "To Mary,"
which Byron himself deliberately suppressed) in its entirety, and in the
original order. The successive additions to the 'Poems on Various
Occasions', 'Hours of Idleness', and 'Poems Original and Translated',
follow in order of publication. The remainder of the series, viz. poems
first published in Moore's 'Life and Journals of Lord Byron' (1830);
poems hitherto unpublished; poems first published in the 'Works of Lord
Byron' (1832), and poems contributed to J. C. Hobhouse's 'Imitations and
Translations' (1809), have been arranged in chronological order. (For an
important contribution to the bibliography of the quarto of 1806, and of
the other issues of Byron's Juvenilia, see papers by Mr. R. Edgcumbe,
Mr. H. Buxton Forman, C.B., and others, in the 'Athenaeum', 1885, vol.
ii. pp. 731-733, 769; and 1886, vol. i. p. 101, etc. For a collation of
the contents of the four first issues and of certain large-paper copies
of 'Hours of Idleness', etc., see 'The Bibliography of the Poetical
Works of Lord Byron', vol. vi. of the present edition.)

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE TO ENGLISH BARDS, AND SCOTCH REVIEWERS.


The MS. ('MS. M.') of the first draft of Byron's "Satire" (see Letter to
Pigot, October 26, 1807) is now in Mr. Murray's possession. It is
written on folio sheets paged 6-25, 28-41, and numbers 360 lines.
Mutilations on pages 12, 13, 34, 35 account for the absence of ten
additional lines.

After the publication of the January number of 'The Edinburgh Review'
for 1808 (containing the critique on 'Hours of Idleness'), which was
delayed till the end of February, Byron added a beginning and an ending
to the original draft. The MSS. of these additions, which number ninety
lines, are written on quarto sheets, and have been bound up with the
folios. (Lines 1-16 are missing.) The poem, which with these and other
additions had run up to 560 lines, was printed in book form (probably by
Ridge of Newark), under the title of 'British Bards, A Satire'. "This
Poem," writes Byron ['MSS. M.'], "was begun in October, 1807, in London,
and at different intervals composed from that period till September,
1808, when it was completed at Newstead Abbey.--B., 1808." A date, 1808,
is affixed to the last line. Only one copy is extant, that which was
purchased, in 1867, from the executors of R.C. Dallas, by the Trustees
of the British Museum. Even this copy has been mutilated. Pages 17, 18,
which must have contained the first version of the attack on Jeffrey
(see 'English Bards', p. 332, line 439, 'note' 2), have been torn out,
and quarto proof-sheets in smaller type of lines 438-527, "Hail to
immortal Jeffrey," etc., together with a quarto proof-sheet, in the same
type as 'British Bards', containing lines 540-559, "Illustrious
Holland," etc., have been inserted. Hobhouse's lines (first edition,
lines 247-262), which are not in the original draft, are included in
'British Bards'. The insertion of the proofs increased the printed
matter to 584 lines. After the completion of this revised version of
'British Bards', additions continued to be made. Marginal corrections
and MS. fragments, bound up with 'British Bards', together with
forty-four lines (lines 723-726, 819-858) which do not occur in MS. M.,
make up with the printed matter the 696 lines which were published in
March, 1809, under the title of 'English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers'.
The folio and quarto sheets in Mr. Murray's possession ('MS. M.') may be
regarded as the MS. of 'British Bards; British Bards' (there are a few
alterations, e.g. the substitution of lines 319-326, "Moravians, arise,"
etc., for the eight lines on Pratt, which are to be found in the folio
MS., and are printed in 'British Bards'), with its accompanying MS.
fragments, as the foundation of the text of the first edition of
'English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers'.

Between the first edition, published in March, and the second edition in
October, 1809, the difference is even greater than between the first
edition and 'British Bards'. The Preface was enlarged, and a postscript
affixed to the text of the poem. Hobhouse's lines (first edition,
247-262) were omitted, and the following additional passages inserted,
viz.: (i.) lines 1-96, "Still must I hear," etc.; (ii.) lines 129-142,
"Thus saith the Preacher," etc.; (iii.) lines 363-417, "But if some
new-born whim," etc.; (iv.) lines 638-706, "Or hail at once," etc.; (v.)
lines 765-798, "When some brisk youth," etc.; (vi.) lines 859-880, "And
here let Shee," etc.; (vii.) lines 949-960, "Yet what avails," etc.;
(viii.) lines 973-980, "There, Clarke," etc.; (ix.) lines 1011-1070,
"Then hapless Britain," etc. These additions number 370 lines, and,
together with the 680 lines of the first edition (reduced from 696 by
the omission of Hobhouse's contribution), make up the 1050 lines of the
second and third editions, and the doubtful fourth edition of 1810. Of
these additions, Nos. i., ii., iii., iv., vi., viii., ix. exist in MS.,
and are bound up with the folio MS. now in Mr. Murray's possession.

The third edition, which is, generally, dated 1810, is a replica of the
second edition.

The first issue of the fourth edition, which appeared in 1810, is
identical with the second and third editions. A second issue of the
fourth edition, dated 1811, must have passed under Byron's own
supervision. Lines 723, 724 are added, and lines 725, 726 are materially
altered. The fourth edition of 1811 numbers 1052 lines.

The suppressed fifth edition, numbering 1070 lines (the copy in the
British Museum has the title-page of the fourth edition; a second copy,
in Mr. Murray's possession, has no title-page), varies from the fourth
edition of 1811 by the addition of lines 97-102 and 528-539, and by some
twenty-nine emendations of the text. Eighteen of these emendations were
made by Byron in a copy of the fourth edition which belonged to Leigh
Hunt. On another copy, in Mr. Murray's possession, Byron made nine
emendations, of which six are identical with those in the Hunt copy, and
three appear for the first time. It was in the latter volume that he
inscribed his after-thoughts, which are dated "B. 1816."

Scotch Reviewers', and textual emendations in the two annotated volumes,
and for a note on genuine and spurious copies of the first and other
editions, see 'The Bibliography of the Poetical Works of Lord Byron',

ON LEAVING NEWSTEAD ABBEY. [i]

    Why dost thou build the hall, Son of the winged days? Thou lookest
    from thy tower to-day: yet a few years, and the blast of the desart
    comes: it howls in thy empty court.-OSSIAN. [1]


I.

  Through thy battlements, Newstead, [2] the hollow winds whistle: [ii]
    Thou, the hall of my Fathers, art gone to decay;
  In thy once smiling garden, the hemlock and thistle
    Have choak'd up the rose, which late bloom'd in the way.


2.

  Of the mail-cover'd Barons, who, proudly, to battle, [iii]
    Led their vassals from Europe to Palestine's plain, [3]
  The escutcheon and shield, which with ev'ry blast rattle,
    Are the only sad vestiges now that remain.


3.

  No more doth old Robert, with harp-stringing numbers,
    Raise a flame, in the breast, for the war-laurell'd wreath;
  Near Askalon's towers, John of Horistan [4] slumbers,
    Unnerv'd is the hand of his minstrel, by death.


4.

  Paul and Hubert too sleep in the valley of Cressy;
    For the safety of Edward and England they fell:
  My Fathers! the tears of your country redress ye:
    How you fought! how you died! still her annals can tell.


5.

  On Marston, [5] with Rupert, [6] 'gainst traitors contending,
    Four brothers enrich'd, with their blood, the bleak field;
  For the rights of a monarch their country defending, [iv]
    Till death their attachment to royalty seal'd. [7]


6.

  Shades of heroes, farewell! your descendant departing
    From the seat of his ancestors, bids you adieu! [v]
  Abroad, or at home, your remembrance imparting
    New courage, he'll think upon glory and you.


7.

  Though a tear dim his eye at this sad separation, [vi]
    'Tis nature, not fear, that excites his regret; [vii]
  Far distant he goes, with the same emulation,
    The fame of his Fathers he ne'er can forget. [viii]


8.

  That fame, and that memory, still will he cherish; [ix]
    He vows that he ne'er will disgrace your renown:
  Like you will he live, or like you will he perish;
    When decay'd, may he mingle his dust with your own!

founded about the year 1170, by Henry II. On the dissolution of the
monasteries it was granted (in 1540) by Henry VIII. to "Sir John Byron
the Little, with the great beard." His portrait is still preserved at
Newstead.]

[Footnote 3: No record of any crusading ancestors in the Byron family
can be found. Moore conjectures that the legend was suggested by some
groups of heads on the old panel-work at Newstead, which appear to
represent Christian soldiers and Saracens, and were, most probably, put
up before the Abbey came into the possession of the family.]

[Footnote 7: Sir Nicholas Byron, the great-grandson of Sir John Byron
the Little, distinguished himself in the Civil Wars. He is described by
Clarendon (_Hist, of the Rebellion_, 1807, i. 216) as "a person of great
affability and dexterity, as well as martial knowledge." He was Governor
of Carlisle, and afterwards Governor of Chester. His nephew and
heir-at-law, Sir John Byron, of Clayton, K.B. (1599-1652), was raised to
the peerage as Baron Byron of Rochdale, after the Battle of Newbury,
October 26, 1643. He held successively the posts of Lieutenant of the
Tower, Governor of Chester, and, after the expulsion of the Royal Family
from England, Governor to the Duke of York. He died childless, and was
succeeded by his brother Richard, the second lord, from whom the poet
was descended. Five younger brothers, as Richard's monument in the
chancel of Hucknall Torkard Church records, "faithfully served King
Charles the First in the Civil Wars, suffered much for their loyalty,
and lost all their present fortunes." (See _Life of Lord Byron_, by Karl
Elze: Appendix, Note (A), p. 436.)]

TO E---[1]


  Let Folly smile, to view the names
    Of thee and me, in Friendship twin'd;
  Yet Virtue will have greater claims
    To love, than rank with vice combin'd.

  And though unequal is _thy_ fate,
    Since title deck'd my higher birth;
  Yet envy not this gaudy state,
    _Thine_ is the pride of modest worth.

  Our _souls_ at least congenial meet,
    Nor can _thy_ lot _my_ rank disgrace;
  Our intercourse is not less sweet,
    Since worth of rank supplies the place.


_November_, 1802.



[Footnote 1: E---was, according to Moore, a boy of Byron's own age, the
  son of one of the tenants at Newstead.]







ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG LADY, [1]
  COUSIN TO THE AUTHOR, AND VERY DEAR TO HIM.


1.

  Hush'd are the winds, and still the evening gloom,
    Not e'en a zephyr wanders through the grove,
  Whilst I return to view my Margaret's tomb,
    And scatter flowers on the dust I love.


2.

  Within this narrow cell reclines her clay,
    That clay, where once such animation beam'd;
  The King of Terrors seiz'd her as his prey;
    Not worth, nor beauty, have her life redeem'd.


3.

  Oh! could that King of Terrors pity feel,
    Or Heaven reverse the dread decree of fate,
  Not here the mourner would his grief reveal,
    Not here the Muse her virtues would relate.


4.

  But wherefore weep? Her matchless spirit soars
    Beyond where splendid shines the orb of day;
  And weeping angels lead her to those bowers,
    Where endless pleasures virtuous deeds repay.


5.

  And shall presumptuous mortals Heaven arraign!
    And, madly, Godlike Providence accuse!
  Ah! no, far fly from me attempts so vain;--
    I'll ne'er submission to my God refuse.


6.

  Yet is remembrance of those virtues dear,
    Yet fresh the memory of that beauteous face;
  Still they call forth my warm affection's tear,
    Still in my heart retain their wonted place. [i]



1802.


[Footnote 1: The author claims the indulgence of the reader more for
this piece than, perhaps, any other in the collection; but as it was
written at an earlier period than the rest (being composed at the age of
fourteen), and his first essay, he preferred submitting it to the
indulgence of his friends in its present state, to making either
addition or alteration.--[4to]

  "My first dash into poetry was as early as 1800. It was the ebullition
  of a passion for--my first cousin, Margaret Parker (daughter and
  granddaughter of the two Admirals Parker), one of the most beautiful
  of evanescent beings. I have long forgotten the verse; but it would be
  difficult for me to forget her--her dark eyes--her long
  eye-lashes--her completely Greek cast of face and figure! I was then
  about twelve--she rather older, perhaps a year. She died about a year
  or two afterwards, in consequence of a fall, which injured her spine,
  and induced consumption ... I knew nothing of her illness, being at
  Harrow and in the country till she was gone. Some years after, I made
  an attempt at an elegy--a very dull one."--_Byron Diary_, 1821;
  _Life_, p. 17.

[Margaret Parker was the sister of Sir Peter Parker, whose death at
Baltimore, in 1814, Byron celebrated in the "Elegiac Stanzas," which
were first published in the poems attached to the seventh edition of
_Childe Harold_.]

TO D---[1]


1.

  In thee, I fondly hop'd to clasp
    A friend, whom death alone could sever;
  Till envy, with malignant grasp, [i]
    Detach'd thee from my breast for ever.


2.

  True, she has forc'd thee from my _breast_,
    Yet, in my _heart_, thou keep'st thy seat; [ii]
  There, there, thine image still must rest,
    Until that heart shall cease to beat.


3.

  And, when the grave restores her dead,
    When life again to dust is given,
  On _thy dear_ breast I'll lay my head--
    Without _thee! where_ would be _my Heaven?_

TO CAROLINE. [i]


1.

  Think'st thou I saw thy beauteous eyes,
    Suffus'd in tears, implore to stay;
  And heard _unmov'd_ thy plenteous sighs,
    Which said far more than words can say? [ii]


2.

  Though keen the grief _thy_ tears exprest, [iii]
    When love and hope lay _both_ o'erthrown;
  Yet still, my girl, _this_ bleeding breast
    Throbb'd, with deep sorrow, as _thine own_.


3.

  But, when our cheeks with anguish glow'd,
    When _thy_ sweet lips were join'd to mine;
  The tears that from _my_ eyelids flow'd
    Were lost in those which fell from _thine_.


4.

  Thou could'st not feel my burning cheek,
    _Thy_ gushing tears had quench'd its flame,
  And, as thy tongue essay'd to speak,
    In _sighs alone_ it breath'd my name.


5.

  And yet, my girl, we weep in vain,
    In vain our fate in sighs deplore;
  Remembrance only can remain,
    But _that_, will make us weep the more.


6.

  Again, thou best belov'd, adieu!
    Ah! if thou canst, o'ercome regret,
  Nor let thy mind past joys review,
    Our only _hope_ is, to _forget_!

TO CAROLINE. [1]


1.

  You say you love, and yet your eye
    No symptom of that love conveys,
  You say you love, yet know not why,
    Your cheek no sign of love betrays.


2.

  Ah! did that breast with ardour glow,
  With me alone it joy could know,
  Or feel with me the listless woe,
    Which racks my heart when far from thee.


3.

  Whene'er we meet my blushes rise,
    And mantle through my purpled cheek,
  But yet no blush to mine replies,
    Nor e'en your eyes your love bespeak.


4.

  Your voice alone declares your flame,
  And though so sweet it breathes my name,
  Our passions still are not the same;
    Alas! you cannot love like me.


5.

  For e'en your lip seems steep'd in snow,
    And though so oft it meets my kiss,
  It burns with no responsive glow,
    Nor melts like mine in dewy bliss.


6.

  Ah! what are words to love like _mine_,
  Though uttered by a voice like thine,
  I still in murmurs must repine,
    And think that love can ne'er be _true_,


7.

  Which meets me with no joyous sign,
    Without a sigh which bids adieu;
  How different is my love from thine,
    How keen my grief when leaving you.


8.

  Your image fills my anxious breast,
  Till day declines adown the West,
  And when at night, I sink to rest,
      In dreams your fancied form I view.


9.

  'Tis then your breast, no longer cold,
    With equal ardour seems to burn,
  While close your arms around me fold,
    Your lips my kiss with warmth return.


10.

  Ah! would these joyous moments last;
  Vain HOPE! the gay delusion's past,
  That voice!--ah! no, 'tis but the blast,
    Which echoes through the neighbouring grove.


11.

  But when _awake_, your lips I seek,
    And clasp enraptur'd all your charms,
  So chill's the pressure of your cheek,
    I fold a statue in my arms.


12.

  If thus, when to my heart embrac'd,
  No pleasure in your eyes is trac'd,
  You may be prudent, fair, and _chaste_,
    But ah! my girl, you _do not love_.


[Footnote 1: These lines, which appear in the Quarto, were never

TO EMMA. [1]


  1.

  Since now the hour is come at last,
    When you must quit your anxious lover;
  Since now, our dream of bliss is past,
    One pang, my girl, and all is over.


  2.

  Alas! that pang will be severe,
    Which bids us part to meet no more;
  Which tears me far from _one_ so dear,
    _Departing_ for a distant shore.


  3.

  Well! we have pass'd some happy hours,
    And joy will mingle with our tears;
  When thinking on these ancient towers,
    The shelter of our infant years;


  4.

  Where from this Gothic casement's height,
    We view'd the lake, the park, the dell,
  And still, though tears obstruct our sight,
    We lingering look a last farewell,


  5.

  O'er fields through which we us'd to run,
    And spend the hours in childish play;
  O'er shades where, when our race was done,
    Reposing on my breast you lay;


  6.

  Whilst I, admiring, too remiss,
    Forgot to scare the hovering flies,
  Yet envied every fly the kiss,
    It dar'd to give your slumbering eyes:


  7.

  See still the little painted _bark_,
    In which I row'd you o'er the lake;
  See there, high waving o'er the park,
    The _elm_ I clamber'd for your sake.


  8.

  These times are past, our joys are gone,
    You leave me, leave this happy vale;
  These scenes, I must retrace alone;
    Without thee, what will they avail?


  9.

  Who can conceive, who has not prov'd,
    The anguish of a last embrace?
  When, torn from all you fondly lov'd,
    You bid a long adieu to peace.


  10.

  _This_ is the deepest of our woes,
    For _this_ these tears our cheeks bedew;
  This is of love the final close,
    Oh, God! the fondest, _last_ adieu!

  Dear simple girl, those flattering arts,

  Mere phantoms of thine own creation; [iii]

ON A CHANGE OF MASTERS AT A GREAT PUBLIC SCHOOL. [1]


  Where are those honours, IDA! once your own,
  When Probus fill'd your magisterial throne?
  As ancient Rome, fast falling to disgrace,
  Hail'd a Barbarian in her Cæsar's place,
  So you, degenerate, share as hard a fate,
  And seat _Pomposus_ where your _Probus_ sate.
  Of narrow brain, yet of a narrower soul, [i]
  Pomposus holds you in his harsh controul;
  Pomposus, by no social virtue sway'd,
  With florid jargon, and with vain parade;
  With noisy nonsense, and new-fangled rules,
  (Such as were ne'er before enforc'd in schools.) [ii]
  Mistaking _pedantry_ for _learning's_ laws,

[Footnote 1: In March, 1805, Dr. Drury, the Probus of the piece,
retired from the Head-mastership of Harrow School, and was succeeded by
Dr. Butler, the Pomposus. "Dr. Drury," said Byron, in one of his
note-books, "was the best, the kindest (and yet strict, too) friend I
ever had; and I look upon him still as a father." Out of affection to
his late preceptor, Byron advocated the election of Mark Drury to the
vacant post, and hence his dislike of the successful candidate. He was
reconciled to Dr. Butler before departing for Greece, in 1809, and in
his diary he says, "I treated him rebelliously, and have been sorry ever
since." (See allusions in and notes to "Childish Recollections," pp.
84-106, and especially note I, p. 88, notes I and 2, p. 89, and note I,

EPITAPH ON A BELOVED FRIEND.[1]

[Greek: Astaer prin men elampes eni tsuoisin hepsos.]

[Plato's Epitaph (Epig. Græc., Jacobs, 1826, p. 309),
quoted by Diog. Laertins.]


  Oh, Friend! for ever lov'd, for ever dear! [i]
  What fruitless tears have bathed thy honour'd bier!
  What sighs re-echo'd to thy parting breath,
  Whilst thou wast struggling in the pangs of death!
  Could tears retard the tyrant in his course;
  Could sighs avert his dart's relentless force;
  Could youth and virtue claim a short delay,
  Or beauty charm the spectre from his prey;
  Thou still hadst liv'd to bless my aching sight,
  Thy comrade's honour and thy friend's delight.
  If yet thy gentle spirit hover nigh
  The spot where now thy mouldering ashes lie,
  Here wilt thou read, recorded on my heart,
  A grief too deep to trust the sculptor's art.
  No marble marks thy couch of lowly sleep,
  But living statues there are seen to weep;
  Affliction's semblance bends not o'er thy tomb,
  Affliction's self deplores thy youthful doom.
  What though thy sire lament his failing line,
  A father's sorrows cannot equal mine!
  Though none, like thee, his dying hour will cheer,
  Yet other offspring soothe his anguish here:
  But, who with me shall hold thy former place?
  Thine image, what new friendship can efface?
  Ah, none!--a father's tears will cease to flow,
  Time will assuage an infant brother's woe;
  To all, save one, is consolation known,
  While solitary Friendship sighs alone.

  _Oh Boy! for ever loved, for ever dear!
  What fruitless tears have wash'd thy honour'd bier;
  What sighs re-echoed to thy parting breath,

  Could sighs have checked his dart's relentless force; [iii]
  Could youth and virtue claim a short delay,
  Or beauty charm the spectre from his prey,
  Thou still had'st liv'd to bless my aching sight,
  Thy comrade's honour, and thy friend's delight:
  Though low thy lot since in a cottage born,
  No titles did thy humble name adorn,
  To me, far dearer, was thy artless love,
  Than all the joys, wealth, fame, and friends could prove.
  For thee alone I liv'd, or wish'd to live,
  (Oh God! if impious, this rash word forgive,)
  Heart-broken now, I wait an equal doom,
  Content to join thee in thy turf-clad tomb;
  Where this frail form compos'd in endless rest,
  I'll make my last, cold, pillow on thy breast;
  That breast where oft in life, I've laid my head,
  Will yet receive me mouldering with the dead;
  This life resign'd, without one parting sigh,
  Together in one bed of earth we'll lie!
  Together share the fate to mortals given,
  Together mix our dust, and hope for Heaven._

A FRAGMENT. [1]

  When, to their airy hall, my Fathers' voice
  Shall call my spirit, joyful in their choice;
  When, pois'd upon the gale, my form shall ride,
  Or, dark in mist, descend the mountain's side;
  Oh! may my shade behold no sculptur'd urns,
  To mark the spot where earth to earth returns!
  No lengthen'd scroll, no praise-encumber'd stone; [i]
  My _epitaph_ shall be my name alone: [2]
  If _that_ with honour fail to crown my clay, [ii]
  Oh! may no other fame my deeds repay!
  _That_, only _that_, shall single out the spot;
  By that remember'd, or with that forgot. [iii]

[Footnote 1: There is no heading in the Quarto.]

[Footnote 2: In his will, drawn up in 1811, Byron gave directions that
"no inscription, save his name and age, should be written on his tomb."
June, 1819, he wrote to Murray: "Some of the epitaphs at the Certosa
cemetery, at Ferrara, pleased me more than the more splendid monuments
at Bologna; for instance, 'Martini Luigi Implora pace.' Can anything be
more full of pathos? I hope whoever may survive me will see those two
words, and no more, put over me."--'Life', pp. 131, 398.]

TO CAROLINE. [1]


1.

  Oh! when shall the grave hide for ever my sorrow?
  Oh! when shall my soul wing her flight from this clay?
  The present is hell! and the coming to-morrow
    But brings, with new torture, the curse of to-day.


2.

  From my eye flows no tear, from my lips flow no curses, [i]
    I blast not the fiends who have hurl'd me from bliss;
  For poor is the soul which, bewailing, rehearses
    Its querulous grief, when in anguish like this--


3.

  Was my eye, 'stead of tears, with red fury flakes bright'ning,
    Would my lips breathe a flame which no stream could assuage,
  On our foes should my glance launch in vengeance its lightning,
    With transport my tongue give a loose to its rage.


4.

  But now tears and curses, alike unavailing,
    Would add to the souls of our tyrants delight;
  Could they view us our sad separation bewailing,
    Their merciless hearts would rejoice at the sight.


5.

  Yet, still, though we bend with a feign'd resignation,
    Life beams not for us with one ray that can cheer;
  Love and Hope upon earth bring no more consolation,
    In the grave is our hope, for in life is our fear.


6.

  Oh! when, my ador'd, in the tomb will they place me,
    Since, in life, love and friendship for ever are fled?
  If again in the mansion of death I embrace thee,
    Perhaps they will leave unmolested--the dead.


1805.


[Footnote 1: [To------.--[4to].]]

[Footnote i: 'fall no curses'.--[4to. 'P. on V. Occasions'.]]







TO CAROLINE. [1]


1.

  When I hear you express an affection so warm,
    Ne'er think, my belov'd, that I do not believe;
  For your lip would the soul of suspicion disarm,
    And your eye beams a ray which can never deceive.


2.

  Yet still, this fond bosom regrets, while adoring,
    That love, like the leaf, must fall into the sear,
  That Age will come on, when Remembrance, deploring,
  Contemplates the scenes of her youth, with a tear;


3.

  That the time must arrive, when, no longer retaining
    Their auburn, those locks must wave thin to the breeze,
  When a few silver hairs of those tresses remaining,
    Prove nature a prey to decay and disease.


4.

  Tis this, my belov'd, which spreads gloom o'er my features,
    Though I ne'er shall presume to arraign the decree
  Which God has proclaim'd as the fate of his creatures,
    In the death which one day will deprive you of me. [i]


5.

  Mistake not, sweet sceptic, the cause of emotion, [ii]
    No doubt can the mind of your lover invade;
  He worships each look with such faithful devotion,
    A smile can enchant, or a tear can dissuade.


6.

  But as death, my belov'd, soon or late shall o'ertake us,
    And our breasts, which alive with such sympathy glow,
  Will sleep in the grave, till the blast shall awake us,
    When calling the dead, in Earth's bosom laid low.


7.

  Oh! then let us drain, while we may, draughts of pleasure,
    Which from passion, like ours, must unceasingly flow; [iii]
  Let us pass round the cup of Love's bliss in full measure,
    And quaff the contents as our nectar below.

ON A DISTANT VIEW OF THE VILLAGE AND SCHOOL OF HARROW ON THE HILL, 1806.


      Oh! mihi præteritos referat si Jupiter annos.[1]

      VIRGIL.


1.

  Ye scenes of my childhood, whose lov'd recollection
    Embitters the present, compar'd with the past;
  Where science first dawn'd on the powers of reflection,
    And friendships were form'd, too romantic to last; [2]

2.

  Where fancy, yet, joys to retrace the resemblance
    Of comrades, in friendship and mischief allied; [3]
  How welcome to me your ne'er fading remembrance, [i]
    Which rests in the bosom, though hope is deny'd!


3.

  Again I revisit the hills where we sported,
    The streams where we swam, and the fields where we fought; [4]
  The school where, loud warn'd by the bell, we resorted,
    To pore o'er the precepts by Pedagogues taught.


4.

  Again I behold where for hours I have ponder'd,
    As reclining, at eve, on yon tombstone [5] I lay;
  Or round the steep brow of the churchyard I wander'd,
    To catch the last gleam of the sun's setting ray.


5.

  I once more view the room, with spectators surrounded,
    Where, as Zanga, [6] I trod on Alonzo o'erthrown;
  While, to swell my young pride, such applauses resounded,
    I fancied that Mossop [7] himself was outshone.


6.

  Or, as Lear, I pour'd forth the deep imprecation,
    By my daughters, of kingdom and reason depriv'd;
  Till, fir'd by loud plaudits and self-adulation,
    I regarded myself as a _Garrick_ reviv'd. [ii]


7.

  Ye dreams of my boyhood, how much I regret you!
    Unfaded your memory dwells in my breast; [iii]
  Though sad and deserted, I ne'er can forget you:
    Your pleasures may still be in fancy possest.


8.

  To Ida full oft may remembrance restore me, [iv]
    While Fate shall the shades of the future unroll!
  Since Darkness o'ershadows the prospect before me,
    More dear is the beam of the past to my soul!


9.

  But if, through the course of the years which await me,
    Some new scene of pleasure should open to view,
  I will say, while with rapture the thought shall elate me,
    "Oh! such were the days which my infancy knew." [8]

[Footnote 3: Byron was at first placed in the house of Mr. Henry
Drury, but in 1803 was removed to that of Mr. Evans.

  business, and his propensity to make others laugh and disregard their
  employment as much as himself."

THOUGHTS SUGGESTED BY A COLLEGE EXAMINATION.


  High in the midst, surrounded by his peers,
  Magnus [1] his ample front sublime uprears: [i]
  Plac'd on his chair of state, he seems a God,
  While Sophs [2] and Freshmen tremble at his nod;
  As all around sit wrapt in speechless gloom, [ii]
  _His_ voice, in thunder, shakes the sounding dome;
  Denouncing dire reproach to luckless fools,
  Unskill'd to plod in mathematic rules.

   Happy the youth! in Euclid's axioms tried,
  Though little vers'd in any art beside;                          10
  Who, scarcely skill'd an English line to pen, [iii]
  Scans Attic metres with a critic's ken.

  What! though he knows not how his fathers bled,
  When civil discord pil'd the fields with dead,
  When Edward bade his conquering bands advance,
  Or Henry trampled on the crest of France:
  Though marvelling at the name of _Magna Charta_,
  Yet well he recollects the _laws_ of _Sparta_;
  Can tell, what edicts sage _Lycurgus_ made,
  While _Blackstone's_ on the _shelf_, _neglected_ laid;           20
  Of _Grecian dramas_ vaunts the deathless fame,
  Of _Avon's bard_, rememb'ring scarce the name.

  Such is the youth whose scientific pate
  Class-honours, medals, fellowships, await;
  Or even, perhaps, the _declamation_ prize,
  If to such glorious height, he lifts his eyes.
  But lo! no _common_ orator can hope
  The envied silver cup within his scope:
  Not that our _heads_ much eloquence require,
  Th' ATHENIAN'S [3] glowing style, or TULLY'S fire.               30
  A _manner_ clear or warm is useless, since [iv]
  We do not try by _speaking_ to _convince_;
  Be other _orators_ of pleasing _proud_,--
  We speak to _please_ ourselves, not _move_ the crowd:
  Our gravity prefers the _muttering_ tone,
  A proper mixture of the _squeak_ and _groan_:
  No borrow'd _grace_ of _action_ must be seen,
  The slightest motion would displease the _Dean_;
  Whilst every staring Graduate would prate,
  Against what--_he_ could never imitate.                          40

  The man, who hopes t' obtain the promis'd cup,
  Must in one _posture_ stand, and _ne'er look up_;
  Nor _stop_, but rattle over _every_ word--
  No matter _what_, so it can _not_ be heard:
  Thus let him hurry on, nor think to rest:
  Who speaks the _fastest's_ sure to speak the _best_;
  Who utters most within the shortest space,
  May, safely, hope to win the _wordy race_.

  The Sons of _Science_ these, who, thus repaid,
  Linger in ease in Granta's sluggish shade;                       50
  Where on Cam's sedgy banks, supine, they lie,
  Unknown, unhonour'd live--unwept for die:
  Dull as the pictures, which adorn their halls,
  They think all learning fix'd within their walls:
  In manners rude, in foolish forms precise,
  All modern arts affecting to despise;
  Yet prizing _Bentley's, Brunck's_, or _Porson's_ [4] note, [v]
  More than the _verse on which the critic wrote_:
  Vain as their honours, heavy as their Ale, [5]
  Sad as their wit, and tedious as their tale;                     60
  To friendship dead, though not untaught to feel,
  When Self and Church demand a Bigot zeal.
  With eager haste they court the lord of power, [vi]
  (Whether 'tis PITT or PETTY [6] rules the hour;)
  To _him_, with suppliant smiles, they bend the head,
  While distant mitres to their eyes are spread; [vii]
  But should a storm o'erwhelm him with disgrace,
  They'd fly to seek the next, who fill'd his place.
  _Such_ are the men who learning's treasures guard!
  _Such_ is their _practice_, such is their _reward_!              70
  This _much_, at least, we may presume to say--
  The premium can't exceed the _price_ they _pay_. [viii]

  1806.


[Footnote 1:

  No reflection is here intended against the person mentioned under the
  name of Magnus. He is merely represented as performing an unavoidable
  function of his office. Indeed, such an attempt could only recoil upon
  myself; as that gentleman is now as much distinguished by his
  eloquence, and the dignified propriety with which he fills his
  situation, as he was in his younger days for wit and conviviality.

[Dr. William Lort Mansel (1753-1820) was, in 1798, appointed Master of

December 17, 18, 1813) that he wrote the 'Devil's Drive' in imitation of
Porson's 'Devil's Walk'. This was a common misapprehension at the time.
The 'Devil's Thoughts' was the joint composition of Coleridge and
Southey, but it was generally attributed to Porson, who took no trouble
to disclaim it. It was originally published in the 'Morning Post', Sept.
6, 1799, and Stuart, the editor, said that it raised the circulation of
the paper for several days after. (See Coleridge's Poems (1893), pp.
147, 621.)]

place, and subsequently (I had almost said consequently) the honour of
representing the University. A fact so glaring requires no comment.

of the Exchequer in 1805; but in 1807 he lost his seat. In 1809 he

TO MARY,

ON RECEIVING HER PICTURE. [1]


1.

  This faint resemblance of thy charms,
    (Though strong as mortal art could give,)
  My constant heart of fear disarms,
    Revives my hopes, and bids me live.


2.

  Here, I can trace the locks of gold
    Which round thy snowy forehead wave;
  The cheeks which sprung from Beauty's mould,
    The lips, which made me 'Beauty's' slave.


3.

  Here I can trace--ah, no! that eye,
    Whose azure floats in liquid fire,
  Must all the painter's art defy,
    And bid him from the task retire.


4.

  Here, I behold its beauteous hue;
  But where's the beam so sweetly straying, [i.]
  Which gave a lustre to its blue,
    Like Luna o'er the ocean playing?


5.

  Sweet copy! far more dear to me,
    Lifeless, unfeeling as thou art,
  Than all the living forms could be,
    Save her who plac'd thee next my heart.


6.

  She plac'd it, sad, with needless fear,
    Lest time might shake my wavering soul,
  Unconscious that her image there
    Held every sense in fast controul.


7.

  Thro' hours, thro' years, thro' time,'twill cheer--
    My hope, in gloomy moments, raise;
  In life's last conflict 'twill appear,

ON THE DEATH OF MR. FOX,[1]

THE FOLLOWING ILLIBERAL IMPROMPTU APPEARED IN THE "MORNING POST."


  "Our Nation's foes lament on _Fox's_ death,
  But bless the hour, when PITT resign'd his breath:
  These feelings wide, let Sense and Truth unclue,
  We give the palm, where Justice points its due."




TO WHICH THE AUTHOR OF THESE PIECES SENT THE FOLLOWING REPLY [i]
FOR INSERTION IN THE "MORNING CHRONICLE."


  Oh, factious viper! whose envenom'd tooth
  Would mangle, still, the dead, perverting truth; [ii]
  What, though our "nation's foes" lament the fate,
  With generous feeling, of the good and great;
  Shall dastard tongues essay to blast the name [iii]
  Of him, whose meed exists in endless fame?
  When PITT expir'd in plenitude of power,
  Though ill success obscur'd his dying hour,
  Pity her dewy wings before him spread,
  For noble spirits "war not with the dead:"
  His friends in tears, a last sad requiem gave,
  As all his errors slumber'd in the grave; [iv]
  He sunk, an Atlas bending "'neath the weight" [v]
  Of cares o'erwhelming our conflicting state.
  When, lo! a Hercules, in Fox, appear'd,
  Who for a time the ruin'd fabric rear'd:
  He, too, is fall'n, who Britain's loss supplied, [vi]
  With him, our fast reviving hopes have died;
  Not one great people, only, raise his urn,
  All Europe's far-extended regions mourn.
  "These feelings wide, let Sense and Truth undue,
  To give the palm where Justice points its due;" [vii]
  Yet, let not canker'd Calumny assail, [viii]
  Or round her statesman wind her gloomy veil.
  FOX! o'er whose corse a mourning world must weep,
  Whose dear remains in honour'd marble sleep;
  For whom, at last, e'en hostile nations groan,
  While friends and foes, alike, his talents own.--[ix]
  Fox! shall, in Britain's future annals, shine,
  Nor e'en to PITT, the patriot's 'palm' resign;
  Which Envy, wearing Candour's sacred mask,
  For PITT, and PITT alone, has dar'd to ask. [x]

TO A LADY WHO PRESENTED TO THE AUTHOR A LOCK OF HAIR BRAIDED WITH HIS
OWN, AND APPOINTED A NIGHT IN DECEMBER TO MEET HIM IN THE GARDEN. [1]

  These locks, which fondly thus entwine,
  In firmer chains our hearts confine,
  Than all th' unmeaning protestations
  Which swell with nonsense, love orations.
  Our love is fix'd, I think we've prov'd it;
  Nor time, nor place, nor art have mov'd it;
  Then wherefore should we sigh and whine,
  With groundless jealousy repine;
  With silly whims, and fancies frantic,
  Merely to make our love romantic?
  Why should you weep, like _Lydia Languish_,
  And fret with self-created anguish?
  Or doom the lover you have chosen,
  On winter nights to sigh half frozen;
  In leafless shades, to sue for pardon,
  Only because the scene's a garden?
  For gardens seem, by one consent,
  (Since Shakespeare set the precedent;
  Since Juliet first declar'd her passion)
  To form the place of assignation.
  Oh! would some modern muse inspire,
  And seat her by a _sea-coal_ fire;
  Or had the bard at Christmas written,
  And laid the scene of love in Britain;
  He surely, in commiseration,
  Had chang'd the place of declaration.
  In Italy, I've no objection,
  Warm nights are proper for reflection;
  But here our climate is so rigid,
  That love itself, is rather frigid:
  Think on our chilly situation,
  And curb this rage for imitation.
  Then let us meet, as oft we've done,
  Beneath the influence of the sun;
  Or, if at midnight I must meet you,
  Within your mansion let me greet you: [i.]
  'There', we can love for hours together,
  Much better, in such snowy weather,
  Than plac'd in all th' Arcadian groves,
  That ever witness'd rural loves;
  'Then', if my passion fail to please, [ii.]
  Next night I'll be content to freeze;
  No more I'll give a loose to laughter,
  But curse my fate, for ever after. [2]


[Footnote 1: These lines are addressed to the same Mary referred to in
the lines beginning, "This faint resemblance of thy charms." ('Vide
ante', p. 32.)]

[Footnote 2: In the above little piece the author has been accused by
some 'candid readers' of introducing the name of a lady [Julia
Leacroft] from whom he was some hundred miles distant at the time this
was written; and poor Juliet, who has slept so long in "the tomb of all
the Capulets," has been converted, with a trifling alteration of her
name, into an English damsel, walking in a garden of their own creation,
during the month of 'December', in a village where the author never
passed a winter. Such has been the candour of some ingenious critics. We
would advise these 'liberal' commentators on taste and arbiters of
decorum to read 'Shakespeare'.

Having heard that a very severe and indelicate censure has been passed
on the above poem, I beg leave to reply in a quotation from an admired
work, 'Carr's Stranger in France'.--"As we were contemplating a
painting on a large scale, in which, among other figures, is the
uncovered whole length of a warrior, a prudish-looking lady, who seemed
to have touched the age of desperation, after having attentively
surveyed it through her glass, observed to her party that there was a
great deal of indecorum in that picture. Madame S. shrewdly whispered in
my ear 'that the indecorum was in the remark.'"--[Ed. 1803, cap. xvi, p.
171. Compare the note on verses addressed "To a Knot of Ungenerous
Critics," p. 213.]]

TO A BEAUTIFUL QUAKER. [1]


  Sweet girl! though only once we met,
  That meeting I shall ne'er forget;
  And though we ne'er may meet again,
  Remembrance will thy form retain;
  I would not say, "I love," but still,
  My senses struggle with my will:
  In vain to drive thee from my breast,
  My thoughts are more and more represt;
  In vain I check the rising sighs,
  Another to the last replies:
  Perhaps, this is not love, but yet,
  Our meeting I can ne'er forget.

  What, though we never silence broke,
  Our eyes a sweeter language spoke;
  The tongue in flattering falsehood deals,
  And tells a tale it never feels:
  Deceit, the guilty lips impart,
  And hush the mandates of the heart;
  But soul's interpreters, the eyes,
  Spurn such restraint, and scorn disguise.
  As thus our glances oft convers'd,
  And all our bosoms felt rehears'd,
  No _spirit_, from within, reprov'd us,
  Say rather, "'twas the _spirit mov'd_ us."
  Though, what they utter'd, I repress,
  Yet I conceive thou'lt partly guess;
  For as on thee, my memory ponders,
  Perchance to me, thine also wanders.
  This, for myself, at least, I'll say,
  Thy form appears through night, through day;
  Awake, with it my fancy teems,
  In sleep, it smiles in fleeting dreams;
  The vision charms the hours away,
  And bids me curse Aurora's ray
  For breaking slumbers of delight,
  Which make me wish for endless night.
  Since, oh! whate'er my future fate,
  Shall joy or woe my steps await;
  Tempted by love, by storms beset,
  Thine image, I can ne'er forget.

  Alas! again no more we meet,
  No more our former looks repeat;
  Then, let me breathe this parting prayer,
  The dictate of my bosom's care:
  "May Heaven so guard my lovely quaker,
  That anguish never can o'ertake her;
  That peace and virtue ne'er forsake her,
  But bliss be aye her heart's partaker!
  Oh! may the happy mortal, fated [i]
  To be, by dearest ties, related,
  For _her_, each hour, _new joys_ discover, [ii]
  And lose the husband in the lover!
  May that fair bosom never know
  What 'tis to feel the restless woe,
  Which stings the soul, with vain regret,
  Of him, who never can forget!"

TO LESBIA! [i] [1]



1.

  LESBIA! since far from you I've rang'd, [ii]
    Our souls with fond affection glow not;
  You say, 'tis I, not you, have chang'd,
   I'd tell you why,--but yet I know not.


2.

  Your polish'd brow no cares have crost;
    And Lesbia! we are not much older, [iii]
  Since, trembling, first my heart I lost,
    Or told my love, with hope grown bolder.


3.

  Sixteen was then our utmost age,
    Two years have lingering pass'd away, love!
  And now new thoughts our minds engage,
    At least, I feel disposed to stray, love!


4.

  "Tis _I_ that am alone to blame,
    _I_, that am guilty of love's treason;
  Since your sweet breast is still the same,
    Caprice must be my only reason.


5.

  I do not, love! suspect your truth,
    With jealous doubt my bosom heaves not;
  Warm was the passion of my youth,
    One trace of dark deceit it leaves not.


6.

  No, no, my flame was not pretended;
    For, oh! I lov'd you most sincerely;
  And though our dream at last is ended
    My bosom still esteems you dearly.


7.

  No more we meet in yonder bowers;
    Absence has made me prone to roving; [iv]
  But older, firmer _hearts_ than ours
    Have found monotony in loving.


8.

  Your cheek's soft bloom is unimpair'd,
    New beauties, still, are daily bright'ning,
  Your eye, for conquest beams prepar'd, [v]
    The forge of love's resistless lightning.


9.

  Arm'd thus, to make their bosoms bleed,
    Many will throng, to sigh like me, love!
  More constant they may prove, indeed;
    Fonder, alas! they ne'er can be, love!

TO WOMAN.


  Woman! experience might have told me [i]
  That all must love thee, who behold thee:
  Surely experience might have taught
  Thy firmest promises are nought; [ii]
  But, plac'd in all thy charms before me,
  All I forget, but to _adore_ thee.
  Oh memory! thou choicest blessing,
  When join'd with hope, when still possessing; [iii]
  But how much curst by every lover
  When hope is fled, and passion's over.
  Woman, that fair and fond deceiver,
  How prompt are striplings to believe her!
  How throbs the pulse, when first we view
  The eye that rolls in glossy blue,
  Or sparkles black, or mildly throws
  A beam from under hazel brows!
  How quick we credit every oath,
  And hear her plight the willing troth!
  Fondly we hope 'twill last for ay,
  When, lo! she changes in a day.
  This record will for ever stand,'
  "Woman, thy vows are trac'd in sand." [1] [iv]

  _This Record will for ever stand
  That Woman's vows are writ in sand_.

[Footnote 1: The last line is almost a literal translation from a
Spanish proverb.

(The last line is not "almost a literal translation from a Spanish
proverb," but an adaptation of part of a stanza from the 'Diana' of
Jorge de Montemajor--

  "Mirà, el Amor, lo que ordena;
  Que os viene a hazer creer
  Cosas dichas por muger,
  Y escriptas en el arena."

Southey, in his 'Letters from Spain', 1797, pp. 87-91, gives a specimen
of the 'Diana', and renders the lines in question thus--

  "And Love beheld us from his secret stand,
  And mark'd his triumph, laughing, to behold me,
  To see me trust a writing traced in sand,
  To see me credit what a woman told me."

Byron, who at this time had little or no knowledge of Spanish
literature, seems to have been struck with Southey's paraphrase, and
compressed the quatrain into an epigram.]









AN OCCASIONAL PROLOGUE,

DELIVERED BY THE AUTHOR PREVIOUS TO THE PERFORMANCE OF "THE WHEEL OF
FORTUNE" AT A PRIVATE THEATRE. [1]


  Since the refinement of this polish'd age
  Has swept immoral raillery from the stage;
  Since taste has now expung'd licentious wit,
  Which stamp'd disgrace on all an author writ;
  Since, now, to please with purer scenes we seek,
  Nor dare to call the blush from Beauty's cheek;
  Oh! let the modest Muse some pity claim,
  And meet indulgence--though she find not fame.
  Still, not for _her_ alone, we wish respect, [i]
  _Others_ appear more conscious of defect:
  To-night no _vet'ran Roscii_ you behold,
  In all the arts of scenic action old;
  No COOKE, no KEMBLE, can salute you here,
  No SIDDONS draw the sympathetic tear;
  To-night you throng to witness the _début_
  Of embryo Actors, to the Drama new:
  Here, then, our almost unfledg'd wings we try;
  Clip not our _pinions_, ere the _birds can fly_:
  Failing in this our first attempt to soar,
  Drooping, alas! we fall to rise no more.
  Not one poor trembler, only, fear betrays,
  Who hopes, yet almost dreads to meet your praise;
  But all our Dramatis Personæ wait,
  In fond suspense this crisis of their fate.
  No venal views our progress can retard,
  Your generous plaudits are our sole reward;
  For these, each _Hero_ all his power displays, [ii]
  Each timid _Heroine_ shrinks before your gaze:
  Surely the last will some protection find? [iii]
  None, to the softer sex, can prove unkind:
  While Youth and Beauty form the female shield, [iv]
  The sternest Censor to the fair must yield. [v]
  Yet, should our feeble efforts nought avail,
  Should, _after all_, our best endeavours fail;
  Still, let some mercy in your bosoms live,
  And, if you can't applaud, at least _forgive_.

composition."--'Diary; Life', p. 38. The prologue was written by him,
between stages, on his way from Harrogate. On getting into the carriage
at Chesterfield, he said to his companion, "Now, Pigot, I'll spin a

completed his task,--interrupting only once his rhyming reverie, to ask

TO ELIZA. [i]


1.

  Eliza! [1] what fools are the Mussulman sect,
    Who, to woman, deny the soul's future existence;
  Could they see thee, Eliza! they'd own their defect,
    And this doctrine would meet with a general resistance. [ii]


2.

  Had their Prophet possess'd half an atom of sense, [iii]
    He ne'er would have _woman_ from Paradise driven;
  Instead of his _Houris_, a flimsy pretence, [iv]
    With _woman alone_ he had peopled his Heaven.


3.

  Yet, still, to increase your calamities more, [v]
    Not content with depriving your bodies of spirit,
  He allots one poor husband to share amongst four! [vi]--
    With _souls_ you'd dispense; but, this last, who could bear it?


4.

  His religion to please neither party is made;
    On _husbands_ 'tis _hard_, to the wives most uncivil;
  Still I can't contradict, [vii] what so oft has been said,
    "Though women are angels, yet wedlock's the devil."


5.

  This terrible truth, even Scripture has told, [2]
    Ye Benedicks! hear me, and listen with rapture;
  If a glimpse of redemption you wish to behold,
    Of ST. MATT.--read the second and twentieth chapter.


6.

  'Tis surely enough upon earth to be vex'd,
    With wives who eternal confusion are spreading;
  "But in Heaven" (so runs the Evangelists' Text)
    "We neither have giving in marriage, or wedding."


7.

  From this we suppose, (as indeed well we may,)
    That should Saints after death, with their spouses put up more,
  And wives, as in life, aim at absolute sway,
    All Heaven would ring with the conjugal uproar.


8.

  Distraction and Discord would follow in course,
    Nor MATTHEW, nor MARK, nor ST. PAUL, can deny it,
  The only expedient is general divorce,
    To prevent universal disturbance and riot.


9.

  But though husband and wife, shall at length be disjoin'd,
    Yet woman and man ne'er were meant to dissever,
  Our chains once dissolv'd, and our hearts unconfin'd,
    We'll love without bonds, but we'll love you for ever.


10.

  Though souls are denied you by fools and by rakes,
    Should you own it yourselves, I would even then doubt you,
  Your nature so much of _celestial_ partakes,
    The Garden of Eden would wither without you.

THE TEAR.



    O lachrymarum fons, tenero sacros
    Ducentium ortus ex animo; quater
      Felix! in imo qui scatentem
        Pectore te, pia Nympha, sensit. [1]

                 GRAY, 'Alcaic Fragment'.



1.

     When Friendship or Love
     Our sympathies move;
  When Truth, in a glance, should appear,
     The lips may beguile,
     With a dimple or smile,
  But the test of affection's a _Tear_.


2.

     Too oft is a smile
     But the hypocrite's wile,
  To mask detestation, or fear;
     Give me the soft sigh,
     Whilst the soul-telling eye
  Is dimm'd, for a time, with a _Tear_.


3.

     Mild Charity's glow,
     To us mortals below,
  Shows the soul from barbarity clear;
     Compassion will melt,
     Where this virtue is felt,
  And its dew is diffused in a _Tear_.


4.

     The man, doom'd to sail
     With the blast of the gale,
  Through billows Atlantic to steer,
     As he bends o'er the wave
     Which may soon be his grave,
  The green sparkles bright with a _Tear_.


5.

     The Soldier braves death
     For a fanciful wreath
  In Glory's romantic career;
     But he raises the foe
     When in battle laid low,
  And bathes every wound with a _Tear_.


6.

     If, with high-bounding pride,[i]
     He return to his bride!
  Renouncing the gore-crimson'd spear;
     All his toils are repaid
     When, embracing the maid,
  From her eyelid he kisses the _Tear_.


7.

     Sweet scene of my youth! [2]
     Seat of Friendship and Truth,
  Where Love chas'd each fast-fleeting year;
     Loth to leave thee, I mourn'd,
     For a last look I turn'd,
  But thy spire was scarce seen through a _Tear_.


8.

     Though my vows I can pour,
     To my Mary no more, [3]
  My Mary, to Love once so dear,
    In the shade of her bow'r,
    I remember the hour,
  She rewarded those vows with a _Tear_.


9.

     By another possest,
     May she live ever blest!
  Her name still my heart must revere:
     With a sigh I resign,
     What I once thought was mine,
  And forgive her deceit with a _Tear_.


10.

     Ye friends of my heart,
     Ere from you I depart,
  This hope to my breast is most near:
     If again we shall meet,
     In this rural retreat,
  May we _meet_, as we _part_, with a _Tear_.


11.

     When my soul wings her flight
     To the regions of night,
  And my corse shall recline on its bier; [ii]
    As ye pass by the tomb,
    Where my ashes consume,
  Oh! moisten their dust with a _Tear_.


12.

    May no marble bestow
    The splendour of woe,
  Which the children of Vanity rear;
    No fiction of fame
    Shall blazon my name,
  All I ask, all I wish, is a _Tear_.

REPLY TO SOME VERSES OF J. M. B. PIGOT, ESQ.,
ON THE CRUELTY OF HIS MISTRESS. [1]


1.

    Why, Pigot, complain
    Of this damsel's disdain,
  Why thus in despair do you fret?
    For months you may try,
    Yet, believe me, a _sigh_ [i]
  Will never obtain a _coquette_.


2.

     Would you teach her to love?
     For a time seem to rove;
  At first she may _frown_ in a _pet;_
     But leave her awhile,
     She shortly will smile,
  And then you may _kiss_ your _coquette_.


3.

     For such are the airs
     Of these fanciful fairs,
  They think all our _homage_ a _debt_:
     Yet a partial neglect [ii]
     Soon takes an effect,
  And humbles the proudest _coquette_.


4.

     Dissemble your pain,
     And lengthen your chain,
  And seem her _hauteur_ to _regret;_ [iii]
     If again you shall sigh,
     She no more will deny,
  That _yours_ is the rosy _coquette_.


5.

     If still, from false pride, [iv]
     Your pangs she deride,
  This whimsical virgin forget;
     Some _other_ admire,
     Who will _melt_ with your _fire_,
  And laugh at the _little coquette_.


6.

     For _me_, I adore
     Some _twenty_ or more,
  And love them most dearly; but yet,
     Though my heart they enthral,
     I'd abandon them all,
  Did they act like your blooming _coquette_.


7.

     No longer repine,
     Adopt this design, [v]
  And break through her slight-woven net!
     Away with despair,
     No longer forbear
  To fly from the captious _coquette_.


8.

    Then quit her, my friend!
    Your bosom defend,
  Ere quite with her snares you're beset:
    Lest your deep-wounded heart,
    When incens'd by the smart,
  Should lead you to _curse_ the _coquette_.

GRANTA. A MEDLEY.

[Greek: Argureais logchaisi machou kai panta krataese_o.] [1]

(Reply of the Pythian Oracle to Philip of Macedon.)


1.

  Oh! could LE SAGE'S [2] demon's gift
    Be realis'd at my desire,
  This night my trembling form he'd lift
    To place it on St. Mary's spire. [i]


2.

  Then would, unroof'd, old Granta's halls,
    Pedantic inmates full display;
  _Fellows_ who dream on _lawn_ or _stalls_,
    The price of venal votes to pay. [ii]


3.

  Then would I view each rival wight,
    PETTY and PALMERSTON survey;
  Who canvass there, with all their might, [iii]
    Against the next elective day. [3]


4.

  Lo! candidates and voters lie [iv]
    All lull'd in sleep, a goodly number!
  A race renown'd for piety,
    Whose conscience won't disturb their slumber.


5.

  Lord H---[4] indeed, may not demur;
    Fellows are sage, reflecting men:
  They know preferment can occur,
    But very seldom,--_now_ and _then_.


6.

  They know the Chancellor has got
    Some pretty livings in disposal:
  Each hopes that _one_ may be his _lot_,
    And, therefore, smiles on his proposal. [v]


7.

  Now from the soporific scene [vi]
    I'll turn mine eye, as night grows later,
  To view, unheeded and unseen, [vii]
    The studious sons of Alma Mater.


8.

  There, in apartments small and damp,
    The candidate for college prizes,
  Sits poring by the midnight lamp;
    Goes late to bed, yet early rises. [viii]

9.

  He surely well deserves to gain them,
    With all the honours of his college, [ix]
  Who, striving hardly to obtain them,
    Thus seeks unprofitable knowledge:


10.

  Who sacrifices hours of rest,
    To scan precisely metres Attic;
  Or agitates his anxious breast, [x]
    In solving problems mathematic:


11.

  Who reads false quantities in Seale, [5]
    Or puzzles o'er the deep triangle;
  Depriv'd of many a wholesome meal; [xi]
    In _barbarous Latin_ [6] doom'd to wrangle:


12.

  Renouncing every pleasing page,
    From authors of historic use;
  Preferring to the letter'd sage,
    The square of the hypothenuse. [7]


13.

  Still, harmless are these occupations, [xii]
  That hurt none but the hapless student,
  Compar'd with other recreations,
  Which bring together the imprudent;


14.

  Whose daring revels shock the sight,
  When vice and infamy combine,
  When Drunkenness and dice invite, [xiii]
  As every sense is steep'd in wine.


15.

  Not so the methodistic crew,
  Who plans of reformation lay:
  In humble attitude they sue,
  And for the sins of others pray:


16.

  Forgetting that their pride of spirit,
  Their exultation in their trial, [xiv]
  Detracts most largely from the merit
  Of all their boasted self-denial.


17.

  'Tis morn:--from these I turn my sight:
  What scene is this which meets the eye?
  A numerous crowd array'd in white, [8]
  Across the green in numbers fly.


18.

  Loud rings in air the chapel bell;
  'Tis hush'd:--what sounds are these I hear?
  The organ's soft celestial swell
  Rolls deeply on the listening ear.


19.

  To this is join'd the sacred song,
  The royal minstrel's hallow'd strain;
  Though _he_ who hears the _music_ long, [xv]
  Will _never_ wish to _hear again_.


20.

  Our choir would scarcely be excus'd,
  E'en as a band of raw beginners;
  All mercy, now, must be refus'd [xvi]
  To such a set of croaking sinners.


21.

  If David, when his toils were ended,
  Had heard these blockheads sing before him,
  To us his psalms had ne'er descended,--
  In furious mood he would have tore 'em.


22.

  The luckless Israelites, when taken
  By some inhuman tyrant's order,
  Were ask'd to sing, by joy forsaken,
  On Babylonian river's border.


23.

  Oh! had they sung in notes like these [xvii]
  Inspir'd by stratagem or fear,
  They might have set their hearts at ease,
  The devil a soul had stay'd to hear.


24.

  But if I scribble longer now, [xviii]
  The deuce a soul will _stay to read_;
  My pen is blunt, my ink is low;
  'Tis almost time to _stop_, _indeed_.


25.

  Therefore, farewell, old _Granta's_ spires!
  No more, like _Cleofas_, I fly;
  No more thy theme my Muse inspires:
  The reader's tir'd, and so am I.

TO THE SIGHING STREPHON. [1]


1.

  Your pardon, my friend,
  If my rhymes did offend,
  Your pardon, a thousand times o'er;
  From friendship I strove,
  Your pangs to remove,
  But, I swear, I will do so no more.


2.

  Since your _beautiful_ maid,
  Your flame has repaid,
  No more I your folly regret;
  She's now most divine,
  And I bow at the shrine,
  Of this quickly reformèd coquette.


3.

  Yet still, I must own, [i]
  I should never have known,
  From _your verses_, what else she deserv'd;
  Your pain seem'd so great,
  I pitied your fate,
  As your fair was so dev'lish reserv'd.


4.

  Since the balm-breathing kiss [ii]
  Of this magical Miss,
  Can such wonderful transports produce; [iii]
  Since the _"world you forget,
  When your lips once have met,"_
  My counsel will get but abuse.


5.

  You say, "When I rove,"
  "I know nothing of love;"
  Tis true, I am given to range;
  If I rightly remember,
  _I've lov'd_ a good number; [iv]
  Yet there's pleasure, at least, in a change.


6.

  I will not advance, [v]
  By the rules of romance,
  To humour a whimsical fair;
  Though a smile may delight,
  Yet a _frown_ will _affright,_ [vi]
  Or drive me to dreadful despair.


7.

  While my blood is thus warm,
  I ne'er shall reform,
  To mix in the Platonists' school;
  Of this I am sure,
  Was my Passion so pure,
  Thy _Mistress_ would think me a fool. [vii]


8 [viii]

  And if I should shun,
  Every _woman_ for _one,_
  Whose _image_ must fill my whole breast;
  Whom I must _prefer,_
  And _sigh_ but for _her,_
  What an _insult_ 'twould be to the _rest!_


9.

  Now Strephon, good-bye;
  I cannot deny,
  Your _passion_ appears most _absurd;_
  Such _love_ as you plead,
  Is _pure_ love, indeed,
  For it _only_ consists in the _word_.

THE CORNELIAN. [1]


1.

  No specious splendour of this stone
  Endears it to my memory ever;
  With lustre _only once_ it shone,
  And blushes modest as the giver. [i]


2.

  Some, who can sneer at friendship's ties,
  Have, for my weakness, oft reprov'd me;
  Yet still the simple gift I prize,
  For I am sure, the giver lov'd me.


3.

  He offer'd it with downcast look,
  As _fearful_ that I might refuse it;
  I told him, when the gift I took,
  My _only fear_ should be, to lose it.


4.

  This pledge attentively I view'd,
  And _sparkling_ as I held it near,
  Methought one drop the stone bedew'd,
  And, ever since, _I've lov'd a tear._


5.

  Still, to adorn his humble youth,
  Nor wealth nor birth their treasures yield;
  But he, who seeks the flowers of truth,
  Must quit the garden, for the field.


6.

  'Tis not the plant uprear'd in sloth,
  Which beauty shews, and sheds perfume;
  The flowers, which yield the most of both,
  In Nature's wild luxuriance bloom.


7.

  Had Fortune aided Nature's care,
  For once forgetting to be blind,
  _His_ would have been an ample share,
  If well proportioned to his mind.


8.

  But had the Goddess clearly seen,
  His form had fix'd her fickle breast;
  _Her_ countless hoards would _his_ have been,
  And none remain'd to give the rest.



[Footnote 1: The cornelian was a present from his friend Edleston, a
Cambridge chorister, afterwards a clerk in a mercantile house in London.
Edleston died of consumption, May 11, 1811. (See letter from Byron to
Miss Pigot, October 28, 1811.) Their acquaintance began by Byron saving
him from drowning. (MS. note by the Rev. W. Harness.)]

TO M----[i]


1.

  Oh! did those eyes, instead of fire,
    With bright, but mild affection shine:
  Though they might kindle less desire,
    Love, more than mortal, would be thine.


2.

  For thou art form'd so heavenly fair,
    _Howe'er_ those orbs _may_ wildly beam,
  We must _admire,_ but still despair;
    That fatal glance forbids esteem.


3.

  When Nature stamp'd thy beauteous birth,
    So much perfection in thee shone,
  She fear'd that, too divine for earth,
    The skies might claim thee for their own.


4.

  Therefore, to guard her dearest work,
    Lest angels might dispute the prize,
  She bade a secret lightning lurk,
    Within those once celestial eyes.


5.

  These might the boldest Sylph appall,
    When gleaming with meridian blaze;
  Thy beauty must enrapture all;
    But who can dare thine ardent gaze?


6.

  'Tis said that Berenice's hair,
    In stars adorns the vault of heaven;
  But they would ne'er permit _thee_ there,
    _Thou_ wouldst so far outshine the seven.


7.

  For did those eyes as planets roll,
    Thy sister-lights would scarce appear:
  E'en suns, which systems now controul,
    Would twinkle dimly through their sphere. [1]

LINES ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY.[1]


[As the author was discharging his Pistols in a Garden, Two Ladies
passing near the spot were alarmed by the sound of a Bullet hissing near
them, to one of whom the following stanzas were addressed the next
morning.] [2]


1.

  Doubtless, sweet girl! the hissing lead,
    Wafting destruction o'er thy charms [i]
  And hurtling o'er [3] thy lovely head,
    Has fill'd that breast with fond alarms.


2.

  Surely some envious Demon's force,
    Vex'd to behold such beauty here,
  Impell'd the bullet's viewless course,
    Diverted from its first career.


3.

  Yes! in that nearly fatal hour,
    The ball obey'd some hell-born guide;
  But Heaven, with interposing power,
    In pity turn'd the death aside.


4.

  Yet, as perchance one trembling tear
    Upon that thrilling bosom fell;
  Which _I_, th' unconscious cause of fear,
    Extracted from its glistening cell;--


5.

  Say, what dire penance can atone
    For such an outrage, done to thee?
  Arraign'd before thy beauty's throne,
    What punishment wilt thou decree?


6.

  Might I perform the Judge's part,
    The sentence I should scarce deplore;
  It only would restore a heart,
    Which but belong'd to _thee_ before.


7.

  The least atonement I can make
    Is to become no longer free;
  Henceforth, I breathe but for thy sake,
    Thou shalt be _all in all_ to me.


8.

  But thou, perhaps, may'st now reject
    Such expiation of my guilt;
  Come then--some other mode elect?
    Let it be death--or what thou wilt.


9.

  Choose, then, relentless! and I swear
    Nought shall thy dread decree prevent;
  Yet hold--one little word forbear!
    Let it be aught but banishment.

TRANSLATION FROM CATULLUS.

AD LESBIAM.


  Equal to Jove that youth must be--
  _Greater_ than Jove he seems to me--
  Who, free from Jealousy's alarms,
  Securely views thy matchless charms;
  That cheek, which ever dimpling glows,
  That mouth, from whence such music flows,
  To him, alike, are always known,
  Reserv'd for him, and him alone.
  Ah! Lesbia! though 'tis death to me,
  I cannot choose but look on thee;
  But, at the sight, my senses fly,
  I needs must gaze, but, gazing, die;
  Whilst trembling with a thousand fears,
  Parch'd to the throat my tongue adheres,
  My pulse beats quick, my breath heaves short,
  My limbs deny their slight support;
  Cold dews my pallid face o'erspread,
  With deadly languor droops my head,
  My ears with tingling echoes ring,
  And Life itself is on the wing;
  My eyes refuse the cheering light,
  Their orbs are veil'd in starless night:
  Such pangs my nature sinks beneath,
  And feels a temporary death.

  Cruel Cerinthus! does the fell disease [i]

  That I might live for Love and you again;
  But, now, I scarcely shall bewail my fate:
  By Death alone I can avoid your hate.

LUGETE VENERES CUPIDINESQUE (CARM. III.) [i]


  Ye Cupids, droop each little head,
  Nor let your wings with joy be spread,
  My Lesbia's favourite bird is dead,
    Whom dearer than her eyes she lov'd: [ii]
  For he was gentle, and so true,
  Obedient to her call he flew,
  No fear, no wild alarm he knew,
    But lightly o'er her bosom mov'd:

  And softly fluttering here and there,
  He never sought to cleave the air,
  He chirrup'd oft, and, free from care, [iii]
    Tun'd to her ear his grateful strain.
  Now having pass'd the gloomy bourn, [iv]
  From whence he never can return,
  His death, and Lesbia's grief I mourn,
    Who sighs, alas! but sighs in vain.

  Oh! curst be thou, devouring grave!
  Whose jaws eternal victims crave,
  From whom no earthly power can save,
    For thou hast ta'en the bird away:
  From thee my Lesbia's eyes o'erflow,
  Her swollen cheeks with weeping glow;
  Thou art the cause of all her woe,
    Receptacle of life's decay.

IMITATED FROM CATULLUS. [1]

TO ELLEN. [i]


  Oh! might I kiss those eyes of fire,
  A million scarce would quench desire;
  Still would I steep my lips in bliss,
  And dwell an age on every kiss;
  Nor then my soul should sated be,
  Still would I kiss and cling to thee:
  Nought should my kiss from thine dissever,
  Still would we kiss and kiss for ever;
  E'en though the numbers did exceed [ii]
  The yellow harvest's countless seed;
  To part would be a vain endeavour:
  Could I desist?--ah! never--never.

POEMS ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS




TO M. S. G.


1.

  Whene'er I view those lips of thine,
    Their hue invites my fervent kiss;
  Yet, I forego that bliss divine,
    Alas! it were--unhallow'd bliss.


2.

  Whene'er I dream of that pure breast,
    How could I dwell upon its snows!
  Yet, is the daring wish represt,
    For that,--would banish its repose.


3.

  A glance from thy soul-searching eye
    Can raise with hope, depress with fear;
  Yet, I conceal my love,--and why?
    I would not force a painful tear.


4.

  I ne'er have told my love, yet thou
    Hast seen my ardent flame too well;
  And shall I plead my passion now,
    To make thy bosom's heaven a hell?


5.

  No! for thou never canst be mine,
    United by the priest's decree:
  By any ties but those divine,
    Mine, my belov'd, thou ne'er shalt be.


6.

  Then let the secret fire consume,
    Let it consume, thou shalt not know:
  With joy I court a certain doom,
    Rather than spread its guilty glow.


7.

  I will not ease my tortur'd heart,
    By driving dove-ey'd peace from thine;
  Rather than such a sting impart,
    Each thought presumptuous I resign.


8.

  Yes! yield those lips, for which I'd brave
    More than I here shall dare to tell;
  Thy innocence and mine to save,--
    I bid thee now a last farewell.


9.

  Yes! yield that breast, to seek despair
    And hope no more thy soft embrace;
  Which to obtain, my soul would dare,
    All, all reproach, but thy disgrace.


10.

  At least from guilt shall thou be free,
    No matron shall thy shame reprove;
  Though cureless pangs may prey on me,
    No martyr shall thou be to love.







STANZAS TO A LADY, WITH THE POEMS OF CAMOËNS. [1]


1.

  This votive pledge of fond esteem,
    Perhaps, dear girl! for me thou'lt prize;
  It sings of Love's enchanting dream,
    A theme we never can despise.


2.

  Who blames it but the envious fool,
    The old and disappointed maid?
  Or pupil of the prudish school,
    In single sorrow doom'd to fade?


3.

  Then read, dear Girl! with feeling read,
    For thou wilt ne'er be one of those;
  To thee, in vain, I shall not plead
    In pity for the Poet's woes.


4.

  He was, in sooth, a genuine Bard;
    His was no faint, fictitious flame:
  Like his, may Love be thy reward,
    But not thy hapless fate the same.

TO M. S. G. [1]


1.

  When I dream that you love me, you'll surely forgive;
    Extend not your anger to sleep;
  For in visions alone your affection can live,--
    I rise, and it leaves me to weep.


2.

  Then, Morpheus! envelop my faculties fast,
    Shed o'er me your languor benign;
  Should the dream of to-night but resemble the last,
    What rapture celestial is mine!


3.

  They tell us that slumber, the sister of death,
    Mortality's emblem is given;
  To fate how I long to resign my frail breath,
    If this be a foretaste of Heaven!


4.

  Ah! frown not, sweet Lady, unbend your soft brow,
    Nor deem me too happy in this;
  If I sin in my dream, I atone for it now,
    Thus doom'd, but to gaze upon bliss.


5.

  Though in visions, sweet Lady, perhaps you may smile,
    Oh! think not my penance deficient!
  When dreams of your presence my slumbers beguile,
    To awake, will be torture sufficient.

TRANSLATION FROM HORACE.


        Justum et tenacem propositi virum.

        HOR. 'Odes', iii. 3. I.


1.

    The man of firm and noble soul
    No factious clamours can controul;
    No threat'ning tyrant's darkling brow
      Can swerve him from his just intent:
    Gales the warring waves which plough,
      By Auster on the billows spent,
    To curb the Adriatic main,
Would awe his fix'd determined mind in vain.


2.

    Aye, and the red right arm of Jove,
    Hurtling his lightnings from above,
    With all his terrors there unfurl'd,
      He would, unmov'd, unaw'd, behold;
    The flames of an expiring world,
      Again in crashing chaos roll'd,
    In vast promiscuous ruin hurl'd,
    Might light his glorious funeral pile:
Still dauntless 'midst the wreck of earth he'd smile.









THE FIRST KISS OF LOVE.


[Greek:

    Ha barbitos de chordais
    Er_ota mounon aechei. [1]

ANACREON ['Ode' 1].


1.

  Away with your fictions of flimsy romance,
    Those tissues of falsehood which Folly has wove; [i]
  Give me the mild beam of the soul-breathing glance,
    Or the rapture which dwells on the first kiss of love.


2.

  Ye rhymers, whose bosoms with fantasy glow, [ii]
    Whose pastoral passions are made for the grove;
  From what blest inspiration your sonnets would flow, [iii]
    Could you ever have tasted the first kiss of love.


3.

  If Apollo should e'er his assistance refuse,
    Or the Nine be dispos'd from your service to rove,
  Invoke them no more, bid adieu to the Muse,
    And try the effect, of the first kiss of love.


4.

  I hate you, ye cold compositions of art,
    Though prudes may condemn me, and bigots reprove;
  I court the effusions that spring from the heart,
    Which throbs, with delight, to the first kiss of love. [iv]


5.

  Your shepherds, your flocks, those fantastical themes, [v]
    Perhaps may amuse, yet they never can move:
  Arcadia displays but a region of dreams; [vi]
    What are visions like these, to the first kiss of love?


6.

  Oh! cease to affirm that man, since his birth, [vii]
    From Adam, till now, has with wretchedness strove;
  Some portion of Paradise still is on earth,
    And Eden revives, in the first kiss of love.


7.

  When age chills the blood, when our pleasures are past--
  For years fleet away with the wings of the dove--
  The dearest remembrance will still be the last,
  Our sweetest memorial, the first kiss of love.

CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1]


    "I cannot but remember such things were,
    And were most dear to me."

    'Macbeth' [2]

    ["That were most precious to me."

    'Macbeth', act iv, sc. 3.]



  When slow Disease, with all her host of Pains, [i]
  Chills the warm tide, which flows along the veins;
  When Health, affrighted, spreads her rosy wing,
  And flies with every changing gale of spring;
  Not to the aching frame alone confin'd,
  Unyielding pangs assail the drooping mind:
  What grisly forms, the spectre-train of woe,
  Bid shuddering Nature shrink beneath the blow,
  With Resignation wage relentless strife,
  While Hope retires appall'd, and clings to life.               10
  Yet less the pang when, through the tedious hour,
  Remembrance sheds around her genial power,
  Calls back the vanish'd days to rapture given,
  When Love was bliss, and Beauty form'd our heaven;
  Or, dear to youth, pourtrays each childish scene,
  Those fairy bowers, where all in turn have been.
  As when, through clouds that pour the summer storm,
  The orb of day unveils his distant form,
  Gilds with faint beams the crystal dews of rain
  And dimly twinkles o'er the watery plain;                      20
  Thus, while the future dark and cheerless gleams,
  The Sun of Memory, glowing through my dreams,
  Though sunk the radiance of his former blaze,
  To scenes far distant points his paler rays,
  Still rules my senses with unbounded sway,
  The past confounding with the present day.

  Oft does my heart indulge the rising thought,
  Which still recurs, unlook'd for and unsought;
  My soul to Fancy's fond suggestion yields,
  And roams romantic o'er her airy fields.                       30
  Scenes of my youth, develop'd, crowd to view,
  To which I long have bade a last adieu!
  Seats of delight, inspiring youthful themes;
  Friends lost to me, for aye, except in dreams;
  Some, who in marble prematurely sleep,
  Whose forms I now remember, but to weep;
  Some, who yet urge the same scholastic course
  Of early science, future fame the source;
  Who, still contending in the studious race,
  In quick rotation, fill the senior place!                      40
  These, with a thousand visions, now unite,
  To dazzle, though they please, my aching sight. [3]

  IDA! blest spot, where Science holds her reign,
  How joyous, once, I join'd thy youthful train!
  Bright, in idea, gleams thy lofty spire,
  Again, I mingle with thy playful quire;
  Our tricks of mischief, [4] every childish game,
  Unchang'd by time or distance, seem the same;
  Through winding paths, along the glade I trace
  The social smile of every welcome face;                        50
  My wonted haunts, my scenes of joy or woe,
  Each early boyish friend, or youthful foe,
  Our feuds dissolv'd, but not my friendship past,--
  I bless the former, and forgive the last.
  Hours of my youth! when, nurtur'd in my breast,
  To Love a stranger, Friendship made me blest,--
  Friendship, the dear peculiar bond of youth,
  When every artless bosom throbs with truth;
  Untaught by worldly wisdom how to feign,
  And check each impulse with prudential rein;                   60
  When, all we feel, our honest souls disclose,
  In love to friends, in open hate to foes;
  No varnish'd tales the lips of youth repeat,
  No dear-bought knowledge purchased by deceit;
  Hypocrisy, the gift of lengthen'd years,
  Matured by age, the garb of Prudence wears: [ii]
  When, now, the Boy is ripen'd into Man,
  His careful Sire chalks forth some wary plan;
  Instructs his Son from Candour's path to shrink,
  Smoothly to speak, and cautiously to think;                    70
  Still to assent, and never to deny--
  A patron's praise can well reward the lie:
  And who, when Fortune's warning voice is heard,
  Would lose his opening prospects for a word?
  Although, against that word, his heart rebel,
  And Truth, indignant, all his bosom swell.

    Away with themes like this! not mine the task,
  From flattering friends to tear the hateful mask;
  Let keener bards delight in Satire's sting,
  My Fancy soars not on Detraction's wing:                       80
  Once, and but once, she aim'd a deadly blow,
  To hurl Defiance on a secret Foe;
  But when that foe, from feeling or from shame,
  The cause unknown, yet still to me the same,
  Warn'd by some friendly hint, perchance, retir'd,
  With this submission all her rage expired.
  From dreaded pangs that feeble Foe to save,
  She hush'd her young resentment, and forgave.
  Or, if my Muse a Pedant's portrait drew,
  POMPOSUS' [5] virtues are but known to few:                    90
  I never fear'd the young usurper's nod,
  And he who wields must, sometimes, feel the rod.
  If since on Granta's failings, known to all
  Who share the converse of a college hall,
  She sometimes trifled in a lighter strain,
  'Tis past, and thus she will not sin again:
  Soon must her early song for ever cease,
  And, all may rail, when I shall rest in peace.

    Here, first remember'd be the joyous band,
  Who hail'd me chief, [6] obedient to command;                   100
  Who join'd with me, in every boyish sport,
  Their first adviser, and their last resort;
  Nor shrunk beneath the upstart pedant's frown, [iii]
  Or all the sable glories of his gown; [iv]
  Who, thus, transplanted from his father's school,
  Unfit to govern, ignorant of rule--
  Succeeded him, whom all unite to praise,
  The dear preceptor of my early days,
  PROBUS, [7] the pride of science, and the boast--
  To IDA now, alas! for ever lost!                               110
  With him, for years, we search'd the classic page, [v]
  And fear'd the Master, though we lov'd the Sage:
  Retir'd at last, his small yet peaceful seat
  From learning's labour is the blest retreat.
  POMPOSUS fills his magisterial chair;
  POMPOSUS governs,--but, my Muse, forbear:
  Contempt, in silence, be the pedant's lot, [vi]
  His name and precepts be alike forgot;
  No more his mention shall my verse degrade,--
  To him my tribute is already paid. [8]                         120

    High, through those elms with hoary branches crown'd [9]
  Fair IDA'S bower adorns the landscape round;
  There Science, from her favour'd seat, surveys
  The vale where rural Nature claims her praise;
  To her awhile resigns her youthful train,
  Who move in joy, and dance along the plain;
  In scatter'd groups, each favour'd haunt pursue,
  Repeat old pastimes, and discover new;
  Flush'd with his rays, beneath the noontide Sun,
  In rival bands, between the wickets run,                       130
  Drive o'er the sward the ball with active force,
  Or chase with nimble feet its rapid course.
  But these with slower steps direct their way,
  Where Brent's cool waves in limpid currents stray,
  While yonder few search out some green retreat,
  And arbours shade them from the summer heat:
  Others, again, a pert and lively crew,
  Some rough and thoughtless stranger plac'd in view,
  With frolic quaint their antic jests expose,
  And tease the grumbling rustic as he goes;                     140
  Nor rest with this, but many a passing fray
  Tradition treasures for a future day:
  "'Twas here the gather'd swains for vengeance fought,
  And here we earn'd the conquest dearly bought:
  Here have we fled before superior might,
  And here renew'd the wild tumultuous fight."
  While thus our souls with early passions swell,
  In lingering tones resounds the distant bell;
  Th' allotted hour of daily sport is o'er,
  And Learning beckons from her temple's door.                    150
  No splendid tablets grace her simple hall,
  But ruder records fill the dusky wall:
  There, deeply carv'd, behold! each Tyro's name
  Secures its owner's academic fame;
  Here mingling view the names of Sire and Son,
  The one long grav'd, the other just begun:
  These shall survive alike when Son and Sire,
  Beneath one common stroke of fate expire; [10]
  Perhaps, their last memorial these alone,
  Denied, in death, a monumental stone,                           160
  Whilst to the gale in mournful cadence wave
  The sighing weeds, that hide their nameless grave.
  And, here, my name, and many an early friend's,
  Along the wall in lengthen'd line extends.
  Though, still, our deeds amuse the youthful race,
  Who tread our steps, and fill our former place,
  Who young obeyed their lords in silent awe,
  Whose nod commanded, and whose voice was law;
  And now, in turn, possess the reins of power,
  To rule, the little Tyrants of an hour;                         170
  Though sometimes, with the Tales of ancient day,
  They pass the dreary Winter's eve away;
