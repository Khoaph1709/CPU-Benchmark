  Behold the well-pair'd couple now advance.
  In such sweet posture our first parents moved,
  While, hand in hand, through Eden's bower they roved.
  Ere yet the devil, with promise fine and false,
  Turned their poor heads, and taught them how to waltz.
  One hand grasps hers, the other holds her hip.
  ...
  For so the law's laid down by Baron Trip."]

[Footnote 26: Richard Fitzpatrick (1747-1813), second son of John, first
Earl of Ossory, served in the first American War at the battles of
Brandywine and Germanstown. He sat as M.P. for Tavistock for
thirty-three years. The chosen friend and companion of Fox, he was a
prominent member of the opposition during the close of the eighteenth
century. In the ministry of "All the Talents" he was Secretary at War.
He dabbled in literature, was one of the authors of the 'Rolliad', and
in 1775 published 'Dorinda: A Town Eclogue'. He was noted for his social
gifts, and in recognition, it is said, of his "fine manners and polite
address," inherited a handsome annuity from the Duke of Queensberry.
Byron associates him with Sheridan as 'un homme galant' and leader of
'ton' of the past generation.]


[Footnote 27: William Douglas, third Earl of March and fourth Duke of
Queensberry (1724-1810), otherwise "old Q.," was conspicuous as a
"blood" and evil liver from youth to extreme old age. He was a patron of
the turf, a connoisseur of Italian Opera, and 'surtout' an inveterate
libertine. As a Whig, he held office in the Household during North's
Coalition Ministry, but throughout George the Third's first illness in
1788, displayed such indecent partisanship with the Prince of Wales,
that, when the king recovered, he lost his post. His dukedom died with
him, and his immense fortune was divided between the heirs to his other
titles and his friends. Lord Yarmouth, whose wife, Maria Fagniani, he
believed to be his natural daughter, was one of the principal legatees.]

TO IANTHE. {1}



   Not in those climes where I have late been straying,
   Though Beauty long hath there been matchless deemed,
   Not in those visions to the heart displaying
   Forms which it sighs but to have only dreamed,
   Hath aught like thee in truth or fancy seemed:
   Nor, having seen thee, shall I vainly seek
   To paint those charms which varied as they beamed -
   To such as see thee not my words were weak;
To those who gaze on thee, what language could they speak?

   Ah! mayst thou ever be what now thou art,
   Nor unbeseem the promise of thy spring,
   As fair in form, as warm yet pure in heart,
   Love's image upon earth without his wing,
   And guileless beyond Hope's imagining!
   And surely she who now so fondly rears
   Thy youth, in thee, thus hourly brightening,
   Beholds the rainbow of her future years,
Before whose heavenly hues all sorrow disappears.

   Young Peri of the West!--'tis well for me
   My years already doubly number thine;
   My loveless eye unmoved may gaze on thee,
   And safely view thy ripening beauties shine:
   Happy, I ne'er shall see them in decline;
   Happier, that while all younger hearts shall bleed
   Mine shall escape the doom thine eyes assign
   To those whose admiration shall succeed,
But mixed with pangs to Love's even loveliest hours decreed.

   Oh! let that eye, which, wild as the gazelle's,
   Now brightly bold or beautifully shy,
   Wins as it wanders, dazzles where it dwells,
   Glance o'er this page, nor to my verse deny
   That smile for which my breast might vainly sigh,
   Could I to thee be ever more than friend:
   This much, dear maid, accord; nor question why
   To one so young my strain I would commend,
But bid me with my wreath one matchless lily blend.

   Such is thy name with this my verse entwined;
   And long as kinder eyes a look shall cast
   On Harold's page, Ianthe's here enshrined
   Shall thus be first beheld, forgotten last:
   My days once numbered, should this homage past
   Attract thy fairy fingers near the lyre
   Of him who hailed thee, loveliest as thou wast,
   Such is the most my memory may desire;
Though more than Hope can claim, could Friendship less require?



CANTO THE FIRST.



I.

   Oh, thou, in Hellas deemed of heavenly birth,
   Muse, formed or fabled at the minstrel's will!
   Since shamed full oft by later lyres on earth,
   Mine dares not call thee from thy sacred hill:
   Yet there I've wandered by thy vaunted rill;
   Yes! sighed o'er Delphi's long-deserted shrine
   Where, save that feeble fountain, all is still;
   Nor mote my shell awake the weary Nine
To grace so plain a tale--this lowly lay of mine.

II.

   Whilome in Albion's isle there dwelt a youth,
   Who ne in virtue's ways did take delight;
   But spent his days in riot most uncouth,
   And vexed with mirth the drowsy ear of Night.
   Ah, me! in sooth he was a shameless wight,
   Sore given to revel and ungodly glee;
   Few earthly things found favour in his sight
   Save concubines and carnal companie,
And flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.

III.

   Childe Harold was he hight: --but whence his name
   And lineage long, it suits me not to say;
   Suffice it, that perchance they were of fame,
   And had been glorious in another day:
   But one sad losel soils a name for aye,
   However mighty in the olden time;
   Nor all that heralds rake from coffined clay,
   Nor florid prose, nor honeyed lines of rhyme,
Can blazon evil deeds, or consecrate a crime.

IV.

   Childe Harold basked him in the noontide sun,
   Disporting there like any other fly,
   Nor deemed before his little day was done
   One blast might chill him into misery.
   But long ere scarce a third of his passed by,
   Worse than adversity the Childe befell;
   He felt the fulness of satiety:
   Then loathed he in his native land to dwell,
Which seemed to him more lone than eremite's sad cell.

V.

   For he through Sin's long labyrinth had run,
   Nor made atonement when he did amiss,
   Had sighed to many, though he loved but one,
   And that loved one, alas, could ne'er be his.
   Ah, happy she! to 'scape from him whose kiss
   Had been pollution unto aught so chaste;
   Who soon had left her charms for vulgar bliss,
   And spoiled her goodly lands to gild his waste,
Nor calm domestic peace had ever deigned to taste.

VI.

   And now Childe Harold was sore sick at heart,
   And from his fellow bacchanals would flee;
   'Tis said, at times the sullen tear would start,
   But pride congealed the drop within his e'e:
   Apart he stalked in joyless reverie,
   And from his native land resolved to go,
   And visit scorching climes beyond the sea;
   With pleasure drugged, he almost longed for woe,
And e'en for change of scene would seek the shades below.

VII.

   The Childe departed from his father's hall;
   It was a vast and venerable pile;
   So old, it seemed only not to fall,
   Yet strength was pillared in each massy aisle.
   Monastic dome! condemned to uses vile!
   Where superstition once had made her den,
   Now Paphian girls were known to sing and smile;
   And monks might deem their time was come agen,
If ancient tales say true, nor wrong these holy men.

VIII.

   Yet ofttimes in his maddest mirthful mood,
   Strange pangs would flash along Childe Harold's brow,
   As if the memory of some deadly feud
   Or disappointed passion lurked below:
   But this none knew, nor haply cared to know;
   For his was not that open, artless soul
   That feels relief by bidding sorrow flow;
   Nor sought he friend to counsel or condole,
Whate'er this grief mote be, which he could not control.

IX.

   And none did love him:  though to hall and bower
   He gathered revellers from far and near,
   He knew them flatterers of the festal hour;
   The heartless parasites of present cheer.
   Yea, none did love him--not his lemans dear -
   But pomp and power alone are woman's care,
   And where these are light Eros finds a feere;
   Maidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare,
And Mammon wins his way where seraphs might despair.

X.

   Childe Harold had a mother--not forgot,
   Though parting from that mother he did shun;
   A sister whom he loved, but saw her not
   Before his weary pilgrimage begun:
   If friends he had, he bade adieu to none.
   Yet deem not thence his breast a breast of steel;
   Ye, who have known what 'tis to dote upon
   A few dear objects, will in sadness feel
Such partings break the heart they fondly hope to heal.

XI.

   His house, his home, his heritage, his lands,
   The laughing dames in whom he did delight,
   Whose large blue eyes, fair locks, and snowy hands,
   Might shake the saintship of an anchorite,
   And long had fed his youthful appetite;
   His goblets brimmed with every costly wine,
   And all that mote to luxury invite,
   Without a sigh he left to cross the brine,
And traverse Paynim shores, and pass earth's central line.

XII.

   The sails were filled, and fair the light winds blew
   As glad to waft him from his native home;
   And fast the white rocks faded from his view,
   And soon were lost in circumambient foam;
   And then, it may be, of his wish to roam
   Repented he, but in his bosom slept
   The silent thought, nor from his lips did come
   One word of wail, whilst others sate and wept,
And to the reckless gales unmanly moaning kept.

XIII.

   But when the sun was sinking in the sea,
   He seized his harp, which he at times could string,
   And strike, albeit with untaught melody,
   When deemed he no strange ear was listening:
   And now his fingers o'er it he did fling,
   And tuned his farewell in the dim twilight,
   While flew the vessel on her snowy wing,
   And fleeting shores receded from his sight,
Thus to the elements he poured his last 'Good Night.'

Adieu, adieu! my native shore
   Fades o'er the waters blue;
The night-winds sigh, the breakers roar,
   And shrieks the wild sea-mew.
Yon sun that sets upon the sea
   We follow in his flight;
Farewell awhile to him and thee,
   My Native Land--Good Night!

A few short hours, and he will rise
   To give the morrow birth;
And I shall hail the main and skies,
   But not my mother earth.
Deserted is my own good hall,
   Its hearth is desolate;
Wild weeds are gathering on the wall,
   My dog howls at the gate.

'Come hither, hither, my little page:
   Why dost thou weep and wail?
Or dost thou dread the billow's rage,
   Or tremble at the gale?
But dash the tear-drop from thine eye,
   Our ship is swift and strong;
Our fleetest falcon scarce can fly
   More merrily along.'

'Let winds be shrill, let waves roll high,
   I fear not wave nor wind;
Yet marvel not, Sir Childe, that I
   Am sorrowful in mind;
For I have from my father gone,
   A mother whom I love,
And have no friend, save these alone,
   But thee--and One above.

'My father blessed me fervently,
   Yet did not much complain;
But sorely will my mother sigh
   Till I come back again.' -
'Enough, enough, my little lad!
   Such tears become thine eye;
If I thy guileless bosom had,
   Mine own would not be dry.

'Come hither, hither, my staunch yeoman,
   Why dost thou look so pale?
Or dost thou dread a French foeman,
   Or shiver at the gale?' -
'Deem'st thou I tremble for my life?
   Sir Childe, I'm not so weak;
But thinking on an absent wife
   Will blanch a faithful cheek.

'My spouse and boys dwell near thy hall,
   Along the bordering lake;
And when they on their father call,
   What answer shall she make?' -
'Enough, enough, my yeoman good,
   Thy grief let none gainsay;
But I, who am of lighter mood,
   Will laugh to flee away.'

For who would trust the seeming sighs
   Of wife or paramour?
Fresh feeres will dry the bright blue eyes
   We late saw streaming o'er.
For pleasures past I do not grieve,
   Nor perils gathering near;
My greatest grief is that I leave
   No thing that claims a tear.

And now I'm in the world alone,
   Upon the wide, wide sea;
But why should I for others groan,
   When none will sigh for me?
Perchance my dog will whine in vain
   Till fed by stranger hands;
But long ere I come back again
   He'd tear me where he stands.

With thee, my bark, I'll swiftly go
   Athwart the foaming brine;
Nor care what land thou bear'st me to,
   So not again to mine.
Welcome, welcome, ye dark blue waves!
   And when you fail my sight,
Welcome, ye deserts, and ye caves!
   My Native Land--Good Night!

XIV.

   On, on the vessel flies, the land is gone,
   And winds are rude in Biscay's sleepless bay.
   Four days are sped, but with the fifth, anon,
   New shores descried make every bosom gay;
   And Cintra's mountain greets them on their way,
   And Tagus dashing onward to the deep,
   His fabled golden tribute bent to pay;
   And soon on board the Lusian pilots leap,
And steer 'twixt fertile shores where yet few rustics reap.

XV.

   Oh, Christ! it is a goodly sight to see
   What Heaven hath done for this delicious land!
   What fruits of fragrance blush on every tree!
   What goodly prospects o'er the hills expand!
   But man would mar them with an impious hand:
   And when the Almighty lifts his fiercest scourge
   'Gainst those who most transgress his high command,
   With treble vengeance will his hot shafts urge
Gaul's locust host, and earth from fellest foemen purge.

XVI.

   What beauties doth Lisboa first unfold!
   Her image floating on that noble tide,
   Which poets vainly pave with sands of gold,
   But now whereon a thousand keels did ride
   Of mighty strength, since Albion was allied,
   And to the Lusians did her aid afford
   A nation swoll'n with ignorance and pride,
   Who lick, yet loathe, the hand that waves the sword.
To save them from the wrath of Gaul's unsparing lord.

XVII.

   But whoso entereth within this town,
   That, sheening far, celestial seems to be,
   Disconsolate will wander up and down,
   Mid many things unsightly to strange e'e;
   For hut and palace show like filthily;
   The dingy denizens are reared in dirt;
   No personage of high or mean degree
   Doth care for cleanness of surtout or shirt,
Though shent with Egypt's plague, unkempt, unwashed, unhurt.

XVIII.

   Poor, paltry slaves! yet born midst noblest scenes -
   Why, Nature, waste thy wonders on such men?
   Lo! Cintra's glorious Eden intervenes
   In variegated maze of mount and glen.
   Ah me! what hand can pencil guide, or pen,
   To follow half on which the eye dilates
   Through views more dazzling unto mortal ken
   Than those whereof such things the bard relates,
Who to the awe-struck world unlocked Elysium's gates?

XIX.

   The horrid crags, by toppling convent crowned,
   The cork-trees hoar that clothe the shaggy steep,
   The mountain moss by scorching skies imbrowned,
   The sunken glen, whose sunless shrubs must weep,
   The tender azure of the unruffled deep,
   The orange tints that gild the greenest bough,
   The torrents that from cliff to valley leap,
   The vine on high, the willow branch below,
Mixed in one mighty scene, with varied beauty glow.

XX.

   Then slowly climb the many-winding way,
   And frequent turn to linger as you go,
   From loftier rocks new loveliness survey,
   And rest ye at 'Our Lady's House of Woe;'
   Where frugal monks their little relics show,
   And sundry legends to the stranger tell:
   Here impious men have punished been; and lo,
   Deep in yon cave Honorius long did dwell,
In hope to merit Heaven by making earth a Hell.

XXI.

   And here and there, as up the crags you spring,
   Mark many rude-carved crosses near the path;
   Yet deem not these devotion's offering -
   These are memorials frail of murderous wrath;
   For wheresoe'er the shrieking victim hath
   Poured forth his blood beneath the assassin's knife,
   Some hand erects a cross of mouldering lath;
   And grove and glen with thousand such are rife
Throughout this purple land, where law secures not life!

XXII.

   On sloping mounds, or in the vale beneath,
   Are domes where whilom kings did make repair;
   But now the wild flowers round them only breathe:
   Yet ruined splendour still is lingering there.
   And yonder towers the prince's palace fair:
   There thou, too, Vathek! England's wealthiest son,
   Once formed thy Paradise, as not aware
   When wanton Wealth her mightiest deeds hath done,
Meek Peace voluptuous lures was ever wont to shun.

XXIII.

   Here didst thou dwell, here schemes of pleasure plan.
   Beneath yon mountain's ever beauteous brow;
   But now, as if a thing unblest by man,
   Thy fairy dwelling is as lone as thou!
   Here giant weeds a passage scarce allow
   To halls deserted, portals gaping wide;
   Fresh lessons to the thinking bosom, how
   Vain are the pleasaunces on earth supplied;
Swept into wrecks anon by Time's ungentle tide.

XXIV.

   Behold the hall where chiefs were late convened!
   Oh! dome displeasing unto British eye!
   With diadem hight foolscap, lo! a fiend,
   A little fiend that scoffs incessantly,
   There sits in parchment robe arrayed, and by
   His side is hung a seal and sable scroll,
   Where blazoned glare names known to chivalry,
   And sundry signatures adorn the roll,
Whereat the urchin points, and laughs with all his soul.

XXV.

   Convention is the dwarfish demon styled
   That foiled the knights in Marialva's dome:
   Of brains (if brains they had) he them beguiled,
   And turned a nation's shallow joy to gloom.
   Here Folly dashed to earth the victor's plume,
   And Policy regained what Arms had lost:
   For chiefs like ours in vain may laurels bloom!
   Woe to the conquering, not the conquered host,
Since baffled Triumph droops on Lusitania's coast.

XXVI.

   And ever since that martial synod met,
   Britannia sickens, Cintra, at thy name;
   And folks in office at the mention fret,
   And fain would blush, if blush they could, for shame.
   How will posterity the deed proclaim!
   Will not our own and fellow-nations sneer,
   To view these champions cheated of their fame,
   By foes in fight o'erthrown, yet victors here,
Where Scorn her finger points through many a coming year?

XXVII.

   So deemed the Childe, as o'er the mountains he
   Did take his way in solitary guise:
   Sweet was the scene, yet soon he thought to flee,
   More restless than the swallow in the skies:
   Though here awhile he learned to moralise,
   For Meditation fixed at times on him,
   And conscious Reason whispered to despise
   His early youth misspent in maddest whim;
But as he gazed on Truth, his aching eyes grew dim.

XXVIII.

   To horse! to horse! he quits, for ever quits
   A scene of peace, though soothing to his soul:
   Again he rouses from his moping fits,
   But seeks not now the harlot and the bowl.
   Onward he flies, nor fixed as yet the goal
   Where he shall rest him on his pilgrimage;
   And o'er him many changing scenes must roll,
   Ere toil his thirst for travel can assuage,
Or he shall calm his breast, or learn experience sage.

XXIX.

   Yet Mafra shall one moment claim delay,
   Where dwelt of yore the Lusians' luckless queen;
   And church and court did mingle their array,
   And mass and revel were alternate seen;
   Lordlings and freres--ill-sorted fry, I ween!
   But here the Babylonian whore had built
   A dome, where flaunts she in such glorious sheen,
   That men forget the blood which she hath spilt,
And bow the knee to Pomp that loves to garnish guilt.

XXX.

   O'er vales that teem with fruits, romantic hills,
   (Oh that such hills upheld a free-born race!)
   Whereon to gaze the eye with joyaunce fills,
   Childe Harold wends through many a pleasant place.
   Though sluggards deem it but a foolish chase,
   And marvel men should quit their easy chair,
   The toilsome way, and long, long league to trace.
   Oh, there is sweetness in the mountain air
And life, that bloated Ease can never hope to share.

XXXI.

   More bleak to view the hills at length recede,
   And, less luxuriant, smoother vales extend:
   Immense horizon-bounded plains succeed!
   Far as the eye discerns, withouten end,
   Spain's realms appear, whereon her shepherds tend
   Flocks, whose rich fleece right well the trader knows -
   Now must the pastor's arm his lambs defend:
   For Spain is compassed by unyielding foes,
And all must shield their all, or share Subjection's woes.

XXXII.

   Where Lusitania and her Sister meet,
   Deem ye what bounds the rival realms divide?
   Or e'er the jealous queens of nations greet,
   Doth Tayo interpose his mighty tide?
   Or dark sierras rise in craggy pride?
   Or fence of art, like China's vasty wall? -
   Ne barrier wall, ne river deep and wide,
   Ne horrid crags, nor mountains dark and tall
Rise like the rocks that part Hispania's land from Gaul

XXXIII.

   But these between a silver streamlet glides,
   And scarce a name distinguisheth the brook,
   Though rival kingdoms press its verdant sides.
   Here leans the idle shepherd on his crook,
   And vacant on the rippling waves doth look,
   That peaceful still 'twixt bitterest foemen flow:
   For proud each peasant as the noblest duke:
   Well doth the Spanish hind the difference know
'Twixt him and Lusian slave, the lowest of the low.

XXXIV.

   But ere the mingling bounds have far been passed,
   Dark Guadiana rolls his power along
   In sullen billows, murmuring and vast,
   So noted ancient roundelays among.
   Whilome upon his banks did legions throng
   Of Moor and Knight, in mailed splendour drest;
   Here ceased the swift their race, here sunk the strong;
   The Paynim turban and the Christian crest
Mixed on the bleeding stream, by floating hosts oppressed.

XXXV.

   Oh, lovely Spain! renowned, romantic land!
   Where is that standard which Pelagio bore,
   When Cava's traitor-sire first called the band
   That dyed thy mountain-streams with Gothic gore?
   Where are those bloody banners which of yore
   Waved o'er thy sons, victorious to the gale,
   And drove at last the spoilers to their shore?
   Red gleamed the cross, and waned the crescent pale,
While Afric's echoes thrilled with Moorish matrons' wail.

XXXVI.

   Teems not each ditty with the glorious tale?
   Ah! such, alas, the hero's amplest fate!
   When granite moulders and when records fail,
   A peasant's plaint prolongs his dubious date.
   Pride! bend thine eye from heaven to thine estate,
   See how the mighty shrink into a song!
   Can volume, pillar, pile, preserve thee great?
   Or must thou trust Tradition's simple tongue,
When Flattery sleeps with thee, and History does thee wrong?

XXXVII.

   Awake, ye sons of Spain! awake! advance
   Lo! Chivalry, your ancient goddess, cries,
   But wields not, as of old, her thirsty lance,
   Nor shakes her crimson plumage in the skies:
   Now on the smoke of blazing bolts she flies,
   And speaks in thunder through yon engine's roar!
   In every peal she calls--'Awake! arise!'
   Say, is her voice more feeble than of yore,
When her war-song was heard on Andalusia's shore?

XXXVIII.

   Hark! heard you not those hoofs of dreadful note?
   Sounds not the clang of conflict on the heath?
   Saw ye not whom the reeking sabre smote;
   Nor saved your brethren ere they sank beneath
   Tyrants and tyrants' slaves?--the fires of death,
   The bale-fires flash on high: --from rock to rock
   Each volley tells that thousands cease to breathe:
   Death rides upon the sulphury Siroc,
Red Battle stamps his foot, and nations feel the shock.

XXXIX.

   Lo! where the Giant on the mountain stands,
   His blood-red tresses deepening in the sun,
   With death-shot glowing in his fiery hands,
   And eye that scorcheth all it glares upon;
   Restless it rolls, now fixed, and now anon
   Flashing afar,--and at his iron feet
   Destruction cowers, to mark what deeds are done;
   For on this morn three potent nations meet,
To shed before his shrine the blood he deems most sweet.

XL.

   By Heaven! it is a splendid sight to see
   (For one who hath no friend, no brother there)
   Their rival scarfs of mixed embroidery,
   Their various arms that glitter in the air!
   What gallant war-hounds rouse them from their lair,
   And gnash their fangs, loud yelling for the prey!
   All join the chase, but few the triumph share:
   The Grave shall bear the chiefest prize away,
And Havoc scarce for joy can cumber their array.

XLI.

   Three hosts combine to offer sacrifice;
   Three tongues prefer strange orisons on high;
   Three gaudy standards flout the pale blue skies.
   The shouts are France, Spain, Albion, Victory!
   The foe, the victim, and the fond ally
   That fights for all, but ever fights in vain,
   Are met--as if at home they could not die -
   To feed the crow on Talavera's plain,
And fertilise the field that each pretends to gain.

XLII.

   There shall they rot--Ambition's honoured fools!
   Yes, Honour decks the turf that wraps their clay!
   Vain Sophistry! in these behold the tools,
   The broken tools, that tyrants cast away
   By myriads, when they dare to pave their way
   With human hearts--to what?--a dream alone.
   Can despots compass aught that hails their sway?
   Or call with truth one span of earth their own,
Save that wherein at last they crumble bone by bone?

XLIII.

   O Albuera, glorious field of grief!
   As o'er thy plain the Pilgrim pricked his steed,
   Who could foresee thee, in a space so brief,
   A scene where mingling foes should boast and bleed.
   Peace to the perished! may the warrior's meed
   And tears of triumph their reward prolong!
   Till others fall where other chieftains lead,
   Thy name shall circle round the gaping throng,
And shine in worthless lays, the theme of transient song.

XLIV.

   Enough of Battle's minions! let them play
   Their game of lives, and barter breath for fame:
   Fame that will scarce reanimate their clay,
   Though thousands fall to deck some single name.
   In sooth, 'twere sad to thwart their noble aim
   Who strike, blest hirelings! for their country's good,
   And die, that living might have proved her shame;
   Perished, perchance, in some domestic feud,
Or in a narrower sphere wild Rapine's path pursued.

XLV.

   Full swiftly Harold wends his lonely way
   Where proud Sevilla triumphs unsubdued:
   Yet is she free--the spoiler's wished-for prey!
   Soon, soon shall Conquest's fiery foot intrude,
   Blackening her lovely domes with traces rude.
   Inevitable hour!  'Gainst fate to strive
   Where Desolation plants her famished brood
   Is vain, or Ilion, Tyre, might yet survive,
And Virtue vanquish all, and Murder cease to thrive.

XLVI.

   But all unconscious of the coming doom,
   The feast, the song, the revel here abounds;
   Strange modes of merriment the hours consume,
   Nor bleed these patriots with their country's wounds;
   Nor here War's clarion, but Love's rebeck sounds;
   Here Folly still his votaries enthralls,
   And young-eyed Lewdness walks her midnight rounds:
   Girt with the silent crimes of capitals,
Still to the last kind Vice clings to the tottering walls.

XLVII.

   Not so the rustic:  with his trembling mate
   He lurks, nor casts his heavy eye afar,
   Lest he should view his vineyard desolate,
   Blasted below the dun hot breath of war.
   No more beneath soft Eve's consenting star
   Fandango twirls his jocund castanet:
   Ah, monarchs! could ye taste the mirth ye mar,
   Not in the toils of Glory would ye fret;
The hoarse dull drum would sleep, and Man be happy yet.

XLVIII.

   How carols now the lusty muleteer?
   Of love, romance, devotion is his lay,
   As whilome he was wont the leagues to cheer,
   His quick bells wildly jingling on the way?
   No! as he speeds, he chants 'Viva el Rey!'
   And checks his song to execrate Godoy,
   The royal wittol Charles, and curse the day
   When first Spain's queen beheld the black-eyed boy,
And gore-faced Treason sprung from her adulterate joy.

XLIX.

   On yon long level plain, at distance crowned
   With crags, whereon those Moorish turrets rest,
   Wide scattered hoof-marks dint the wounded ground;
   And, scathed by fire, the greensward's darkened vest
   Tells that the foe was Andalusia's guest:
   Here was the camp, the watch-flame, and the host,
   Here the brave peasant stormed the dragon's nest;
   Still does he mark it with triumphant boast,
And points to yonder cliffs, which oft were won and lost.

L.

   And whomsoe'er along the path you meet
   Bears in his cap the badge of crimson hue,
   Which tells you whom to shun and whom to greet:
   Woe to the man that walks in public view
   Without of loyalty this token true:
   Sharp is the knife, and sudden is the stroke;
   And sorely would the Gallic foemen rue,
   If subtle poniards, wrapt beneath the cloak,
Could blunt the sabre's edge, or clear the cannon's smoke.

LI.

   At every turn Morena's dusky height
   Sustains aloft the battery's iron load;
   And, far as mortal eye can compass sight,
   The mountain-howitzer, the broken road,
   The bristling palisade, the fosse o'erflowed,
   The stationed bands, the never-vacant watch,
   The magazine in rocky durance stowed,
   The holstered steed beneath the shed of thatch,
The ball-piled pyramid, the ever-blazing match,

LII.

   Portend the deeds to come: --but he whose nod
   Has tumbled feebler despots from their sway,
   A moment pauseth ere he lifts the rod;
   A little moment deigneth to delay:
   Soon will his legions sweep through these the way;
   The West must own the Scourger of the world.
   Ah, Spain! how sad will be thy reckoning day,
   When soars Gaul's Vulture, with his wings unfurled,
And thou shalt view thy sons in crowds to Hades hurled.

LIII.

   And must they fall--the young, the proud, the brave -
   To swell one bloated chief's unwholesome reign?
   No step between submission and a grave?
   The rise of rapine and the fall of Spain?
   And doth the Power that man adores ordain
   Their doom, nor heed the suppliant's appeal?
   Is all that desperate Valour acts in vain?
   And Counsel sage, and patriotic Zeal,
The veteran's skill, youth's fire, and manhood's heart of steel?

LIV.

   Is it for this the Spanish maid, aroused,
   Hangs on the willow her unstrung guitar,
   And, all unsexed, the anlace hath espoused,
   Sung the loud song, and dared the deed of war?
   And she, whom once the semblance of a scar
   Appalled, an owlet's larum chilled with dread,
   Now views the column-scattering bayonet jar,
   The falchion flash, and o'er the yet warm dead
Stalks with Minerva's step where Mars might quake to tread.

LV.

   Ye who shall marvel when you hear her tale,
   Oh! had you known her in her softer hour,
   Marked her black eye that mocks her coal-black veil,
   Heard her light, lively tones in lady's bower,
   Seen her long locks that foil the painter's power,
   Her fairy form, with more than female grace,
   Scarce would you deem that Saragoza's tower
   Beheld her smile in Danger's Gorgon face,
Thin the closed ranks, and lead in Glory's fearful chase.

LVI.

   Her lover sinks--she sheds no ill-timed tear;
   Her chief is slain--she fills his fatal post;
   Her fellows flee--she checks their base career;
   The foe retires--she heads the sallying host:
   Who can appease like her a lover's ghost?
   Who can avenge so well a leader's fall?
   What maid retrieve when man's flushed hope is lost?
   Who hang so fiercely on the flying Gaul,
Foiled by a woman's hand, before a battered wall?

LVII.

   Yet are Spain's maids no race of Amazons,
   But formed for all the witching arts of love:
   Though thus in arms they emulate her sons,
   And in the horrid phalanx dare to move,
   'Tis but the tender fierceness of the dove,
   Pecking the hand that hovers o'er her mate:
   In softness as in firmness far above
   Remoter females, famed for sickening prate;
Her mind is nobler sure, her charms perchance as great.

LVIII.

   The seal Love's dimpling finger hath impressed
   Denotes how soft that chin which bears his touch:
   Her lips, whose kisses pout to leave their nest,
   Bid man be valiant ere he merit such:
   Her glance, how wildly beautiful! how much
   Hath Phoebus wooed in vain to spoil her cheek
   Which glows yet smoother from his amorous clutch!
   Who round the North for paler dames would seek?
How poor their forms appear? how languid, wan, and weak!

LIX.

   Match me, ye climes! which poets love to laud;
   Match me, ye harems! of the land where now
   I strike my strain, far distant, to applaud
   Beauties that even a cynic must avow!
   Match me those houris, whom ye scarce allow
   To taste the gale lest Love should ride the wind,
   With Spain's dark-glancing daughters--deign to know,
   There your wise Prophet's paradise we find,
His black-eyed maids of Heaven, angelically kind.

LX.

   O thou, Parnassus! whom I now survey,
   Not in the frenzy of a dreamer's eye,
   Not in the fabled landscape of a lay,
   But soaring snow-clad through thy native sky,
   In the wild pomp of mountain majesty!
   What marvel if I thus essay to sing?
   The humblest of thy pilgrims passing by
   Would gladly woo thine echoes with his string,
Though from thy heights no more one muse will wave her wing.

LXI.

   Oft have I dreamed of thee! whose glorious name
   Who knows not, knows not man's divinest lore:
   And now I view thee, 'tis, alas, with shame
   That I in feeblest accents must adore.
   When I recount thy worshippers of yore
   I tremble, and can only bend the knee;
   Nor raise my voice, nor vainly dare to soar,
   But gaze beneath thy cloudy canopy
In silent joy to think at last I look on thee!

LXII.

   Happier in this than mightiest bards have been,
   Whose fate to distant homes confined their lot,
   Shall I unmoved behold the hallowed scene,
   Which others rave of, though they know it not?
   Though here no more Apollo haunts his grot,
   And thou, the Muses' seat, art now their grave,
   Some gentle spirit still pervades the spot,
   Sighs in the gale, keeps silence in the cave,
And glides with glassy foot o'er yon melodious wave.

LXIII.

   Of thee hereafter.--Even amidst my strain
   I turned aside to pay my homage here;
   Forgot the land, the sons, the maids of Spain;
   Her fate, to every free-born bosom dear;
   And hailed thee, not perchance without a tear.
   Now to my theme--but from thy holy haunt
   Let me some remnant, some memorial bear;
   Yield me one leaf of Daphne's deathless plant,
Nor let thy votary's hope be deemed an idle vaunt.

LXIV.

   But ne'er didst thou, fair mount, when Greece was young,
   See round thy giant base a brighter choir;
   Nor e'er did Delphi, when her priestess sung
   The Pythian hymn with more than mortal fire,
   Behold a train more fitting to inspire
   The song of love than Andalusia's maids,
   Nurst in the glowing lap of soft desire:
   Ah! that to these were given such peaceful shades
As Greece can still bestow, though Glory fly her glades.

LXV.

   Fair is proud Seville; let her country boast
   Her strength, her wealth, her site of ancient days,
   But Cadiz, rising on the distant coast,
   Calls forth a sweeter, though ignoble praise.
   Ah, Vice! how soft are thy voluptuous ways!
   While boyish blood is mantling, who can 'scape
   The fascination of thy magic gaze?
   A cherub-hydra round us dost thou gape,
And mould to every taste thy dear delusive shape.

LXVI.

   When Paphos fell by Time--accursed Time!
   The Queen who conquers all must yield to thee -
   The Pleasures fled, but sought as warm a clime;
   And Venus, constant to her native sea,
   To nought else constant, hither deigned to flee,
   And fixed her shrine within these walls of white;
   Though not to one dome circumscribeth she
   Her worship, but, devoted to her rite,
A thousand altars rise, for ever blazing bright.

LXVII.

   From morn till night, from night till startled morn
   Peeps blushing on the revel's laughing crew,
   The song is heard, the rosy garland worn;
   Devices quaint, and frolics ever new,
   Tread on each other's kibes.  A long adieu
   He bids to sober joy that here sojourns:
   Nought interrupts the riot, though in lieu
   Of true devotion monkish incense burns,
And love and prayer unite, or rule the hour by turns.

LXVIII.

   The sabbath comes, a day of blessed rest;
   What hallows it upon this Christian shore?
   Lo! it is sacred to a solemn feast:
   Hark! heard you not the forest monarch's roar?
   Crashing the lance, he snuffs the spouting gore
   Of man and steed, o'erthrown beneath his horn:
   The thronged arena shakes with shouts for more;
   Yells the mad crowd o'er entrails freshly torn,
Nor shrinks the female eye, nor e'en affects to mourn.

LXIX.

   The seventh day this; the jubilee of man.
   London! right well thou know'st the day of prayer:
   Then thy spruce citizen, washed artizan,
   And smug apprentice gulp their weekly air:
   Thy coach of hackney, whiskey, one-horse chair,
   And humblest gig, through sundry suburbs whirl;
   To Hampstead, Brentford, Harrow, make repair;
   Till the tired jade the wheel forgets to hurl,
Provoking envious gibe from each pedestrian churl.

LXX.

   Some o'er thy Thamis row the ribboned fair,
   Others along the safer turnpike fly;
   Some Richmond Hill ascend, some scud to Ware,
   And many to the steep of Highgate hie.
   Ask ye, Boeotian shades, the reason why?
   'Tis to the worship of the solemn Horn,
   Grasped in the holy hand of Mystery,
   In whose dread name both men and maids are sworn,
And consecrate the oath with draught and dance till morn.

LXXI.

   All have their fooleries; not alike are thine,
   Fair Cadiz, rising o'er the dark blue sea!
   Soon as the matin bell proclaimeth nine,
   Thy saint adorers count the rosary:
   Much is the Virgin teased to shrive them free
   (Well do I ween the only virgin there)
   From crimes as numerous as her beadsmen be;
   Then to the crowded circus forth they fare:
Young, old, high, low, at once the same diversion share.

LXXII.

   The lists are oped, the spacious area cleared,
   Thousands on thousands piled are seated round;
   Long ere the first loud trumpet's note is heard,
   No vacant space for lated wight is found:
   Here dons, grandees, but chiefly dames abound,
   Skilled in the ogle of a roguish eye,
   Yet ever well inclined to heal the wound;
   None through their cold disdain are doomed to die,
As moon-struck bards complain, by Love's sad archery.

LXXIII.

   Hushed is the din of tongues--on gallant steeds,
   With milk-white crest, gold spur, and light-poised lance,
   Four cavaliers prepare for venturous deeds,
   And lowly bending to the lists advance;
   Rich are their scarfs, their chargers featly prance:
   If in the dangerous game they shine to-day,
   The crowd's loud shout, and ladies' lovely glance,
   Best prize of better acts, they bear away,
And all that kings or chiefs e'er gain their toils repay.

LXXIV.

   In costly sheen and gaudy cloak arrayed,
   But all afoot, the light-limbed matadore
   Stands in the centre, eager to invade
   The lord of lowing herds; but not before
   The ground, with cautious tread, is traversed o'er,
   Lest aught unseen should lurk to thwart his speed:
   His arms a dart, he fights aloof, nor more
   Can man achieve without the friendly steed -
Alas! too oft condemned for him to bear and bleed.

LXXV.

   Thrice sounds the clarion; lo! the signal falls,
   The den expands, and expectation mute
   Gapes round the silent circle's peopled walls.
   Bounds with one lashing spring the mighty brute,
   And wildly staring, spurns, with sounding foot,
   The sand, nor blindly rushes on his foe:
   Here, there, he points his threatening front, to suit
   His first attack, wide waving to and fro
His angry tail; red rolls his eye's dilated glow.

LXXVI.

   Sudden he stops; his eye is fixed:  away,
   Away, thou heedless boy! prepare the spear;
   Now is thy time to perish, or display
   The skill that yet may check his mad career.
   With well-timed croupe the nimble coursers veer;
   On foams the bull, but not unscathed he goes;
   Streams from his flank the crimson torrent clear:
   He flies, he wheels, distracted with his throes:
Dart follows dart; lance, lance; loud bellowings speak his woes.

LXXVII.

   Again he comes; nor dart nor lance avail,
   Nor the wild plunging of the tortured horse;
   Though man and man's avenging arms assail,
   Vain are his weapons, vainer is his force.
   One gallant steed is stretched a mangled corse;
   Another, hideous sight! unseamed appears,
   His gory chest unveils life's panting source;
   Though death-struck, still his feeble frame he rears;
Staggering, but stemming all, his lord unharmed he bears.

LXXVIII.

   Foiled, bleeding, breathless, furious to the last,
   Full in the centre stands the bull at bay,
   Mid wounds, and clinging darts, and lances brast,
   And foes disabled in the brutal fray:
   And now the matadores around him play,
   Shake the red cloak, and poise the ready brand:
   Once more through all he bursts his thundering way -
   Vain rage! the mantle quits the conynge hand,
Wraps his fierce eye--'tis past--he sinks upon the sand.

LXXIX.

   Where his vast neck just mingles with the spine,
   Sheathed in his form the deadly weapon lies.
   He stops--he starts--disdaining to decline:
   Slowly he falls, amidst triumphant cries,
   Without a groan, without a struggle dies.
   The decorated car appears on high:
   The corse is piled--sweet sight for vulgar eyes;
   Four steeds that spurn the rein, as swift as shy,
Hurl the dark bull along, scarce seen in dashing by.

LXXX.

   Such the ungentle sport that oft invites
   The Spanish maid, and cheers the Spanish swain:
   Nurtured in blood betimes, his heart delights
   In vengeance, gloating on another's pain.
   What private feuds the troubled village stain!
   Though now one phalanxed host should meet the foe,
   Enough, alas, in humble homes remain,
   To meditate 'gainst friends the secret blow,
For some slight cause of wrath, whence life's warm stream must flow.

LXXXI.

   But Jealousy has fled:  his bars, his bolts,
   His withered sentinel, duenna sage!
   And all whereat the generous soul revolts,
   Which the stern dotard deemed he could encage,
   Have passed to darkness with the vanished age.
   Who late so free as Spanish girls were seen
   (Ere War uprose in his volcanic rage),
   With braided tresses bounding o'er the green,
While on the gay dance shone Night's lover-loving Queen?

LXXXII.

   Oh! many a time and oft had Harold loved,
   Or dreamed he loved, since rapture is a dream;
   But now his wayward bosom was unmoved,
   For not yet had he drunk of Lethe's stream:
   And lately had he learned with truth to deem
   Love has no gift so grateful as his wings:
   How fair, how young, how soft soe'er he seem,
   Full from the fount of joy's delicious springs
Some bitter o'er the flowers its bubbling venom flings.

LXXXIII.

   Yet to the beauteous form he was not blind,
   Though now it moved him as it moves the wise;
   Not that Philosophy on such a mind
   E'er deigned to bend her chastely-awful eyes:
   But Passion raves itself to rest, or flies;
   And Vice, that digs her own voluptuous tomb,
   Had buried long his hopes, no more to rise:
   Pleasure's palled victim! life-abhorring gloom
Wrote on his faded brow curst Cain's unresting doom.

LXXXIV.

   Still he beheld, nor mingled with the throng;
   But viewed them not with misanthropic hate;
   Fain would he now have joined the dance, the song,
   But who may smile that sinks beneath his fate?
   Nought that he saw his sadness could abate:
   Yet once he struggled 'gainst the demon's sway,
   And as in Beauty's bower he pensive sate,
   Poured forth this unpremeditated lay,
To charms as fair as those that soothed his happier day.


TO INEZ.


Nay, smile not at my sullen brow,
   Alas! I cannot smile again:
Yet Heaven avert that ever thou
   Shouldst weep, and haply weep in vain.

And dost thou ask what secret woe
   I bear, corroding joy and youth?
And wilt thou vainly seek to know
   A pang even thou must fail to soothe?

It is not love, it is not hate,
   Nor low Ambition's honours lost,
That bids me loathe my present state,
   And fly from all I prized the most:

It is that weariness which springs
   From all I meet, or hear, or see:
To me no pleasure Beauty brings;
   Thine eyes have scarce a charm for me.

It is that settled, ceaseless gloom
   The fabled Hebrew wanderer bore,
That will not look beyond the tomb,
   But cannot hope for rest before.

What exile from himself can flee?
   To zones, though more and more remote,
Still, still pursues, where'er I be,
   The blight of life--the demon Thought.

Yet others rapt in pleasure seem,
   And taste of all that I forsake:
Oh! may they still of transport dream,
   And ne'er, at least like me, awake!

Through many a clime 'tis mine to go,
   With many a retrospection curst;
And all my solace is to know,
   Whate'er betides, I've known the worst.

What is that worst?  Nay, do not ask -
   In pity from the search forbear:
Smile on--nor venture to unmask
   Man's heart, and view the hell that's there.

LXXXV.

   Adieu, fair Cadiz! yea, a long adieu!
   Who may forget how well thy walls have stood?
   When all were changing, thou alone wert true,
   First to be free, and last to be subdued.
   And if amidst a scene, a shock so rude,
   Some native blood was seen thy streets to dye,
   A traitor only fell beneath the feud:
   Here all were noble, save nobility;
None hugged a conqueror's chain save fallen Chivalry!

LXXXVI.

   Such be the sons of Spain, and strange her fate!
   They fight for freedom, who were never free;
   A kingless people for a nerveless state,
   Her vassals combat when their chieftains flee,
   True to the veriest slaves of Treachery;
   Fond of a land which gave them nought but life,
   Pride points the path that leads to liberty;
   Back to the struggle, baffled in the strife,
War, war is still the cry, 'War even to the knife!'

LXXXVII.

   Ye, who would more of Spain and Spaniards know,
   Go, read whate'er is writ of bloodiest strife:
   Whate'er keen Vengeance urged on foreign foe
   Can act, is acting there against man's life:
   From flashing scimitar to secret knife,
   War mouldeth there each weapon to his need -
   So may he guard the sister and the wife,
   So may he make each curst oppressor bleed,
So may such foes deserve the most remorseless deed!

LXXXVIII.

   Flows there a tear of pity for the dead?
   Look o'er the ravage of the reeking plain:
   Look on the hands with female slaughter red;
   Then to the dogs resign the unburied slain,
   Then to the vulture let each corse remain;
   Albeit unworthy of the prey-bird's maw,
   Let their bleached bones, and blood's unbleaching stain,
   Long mark the battle-field with hideous awe:
Thus only may our sons conceive the scenes we saw!

LXXXIX.

   Nor yet, alas, the dreadful work is done;
   Fresh legions pour adown the Pyrenees:
   It deepens still, the work is scarce begun,
   Nor mortal eye the distant end foresees.
   Fall'n nations gaze on Spain:  if freed, she frees
   More than her fell Pizarros once enchained.
   Strange retribution! now Columbia's ease
   Repairs the wrongs that Quito's sons sustained,
While o'er the parent clime prowls Murder unrestrained.

XC.

   Not all the blood at Talavera shed,
   Not all the marvels of Barossa's fight,
   Not Albuera lavish of the dead,
   Have won for Spain her well-asserted right.
   When shall her Olive-Branch be free from blight?
   When shall she breathe her from the blushing toil?
   How many a doubtful day shall sink in night,
   Ere the Frank robber turn him from his spoil,
And Freedom's stranger-tree grow native of the soil?

XCI.

   And thou, my friend! since unavailing woe
   Bursts from my heart, and mingles with the strain -
   Had the sword laid thee with the mighty low,
   Pride might forbid e'en Friendship to complain:
   But thus unlaurelled to descend in vain,
   By all forgotten, save the lonely breast,
   And mix unbleeding with the boasted slain,
   While glory crowns so many a meaner crest!
What hadst thou done, to sink so peacefully to rest?

XCII.

   Oh, known the earliest, and esteemed the most!
   Dear to a heart where nought was left so dear!
   Though to my hopeless days for ever lost,
   In dreams deny me not to see thee here!
   And Morn in secret shall renew the tear
   Of Consciousness awaking to her woes,
   And Fancy hover o'er thy bloodless bier,
   Till my frail frame return to whence it rose,
And mourned and mourner lie united in repose.

XCIII.

   Here is one fytte of Harold's pilgrimage.
   Ye who of him may further seek to know,
   Shall find some tidings in a future page,
   If he that rhymeth now may scribble moe.
   Is this too much?  Stern critic, say not so:
   Patience! and ye shall hear what he beheld
   In other lands, where he was doomed to go:
   Lands that contain the monuments of eld,
Ere Greece and Grecian arts by barbarous hands were quelled.



CANTO THE SECOND.



I.

   Come, blue-eyed maid of heaven!--but thou, alas,
   Didst never yet one mortal song inspire -
   Goddess of Wisdom! here thy temple was,
   And is, despite of war and wasting fire,
   And years, that bade thy worship to expire:
   But worse than steel, and flame, and ages slow,
   Is the drear sceptre and dominion dire
   Of men who never felt the sacred glow
That thoughts of thee and thine on polished breasts bestow.

II.

   Ancient of days! august Athena! where,
   Where are thy men of might, thy grand in soul?
   Gone--glimmering through the dream of things that were:
   First in the race that led to Glory's goal,
   They won, and passed away--is this the whole?
   A schoolboy's tale, the wonder of an hour!
   The warrior's weapon and the sophist's stole
   Are sought in vain, and o'er each mouldering tower,
Dim with the mist of years, grey flits the shade of power.

III.

   Son of the morning, rise! approach you here!
   Come--but molest not yon defenceless urn!
   Look on this spot--a nation's sepulchre!
   Abode of gods, whose shrines no longer burn.
   E'en gods must yield--religions take their turn:
   'Twas Jove's--'tis Mahomet's; and other creeds
   Will rise with other years, till man shall learn
   Vainly his incense soars, his victim bleeds;
Poor child of Doubt and Death, whose hope is built on reeds.

IV.

   Bound to the earth, he lifts his eyes to heaven -
   Is't not enough, unhappy thing, to know
   Thou art?  Is this a boon so kindly given,
   That being, thou wouldst be again, and go,
   Thou know'st not, reck'st not to what region, so
   On earth no more, but mingled with the skies!
   Still wilt thou dream on future joy and woe?
   Regard and weigh yon dust before it flies:
That little urn saith more than thousand homilies.

V.

   Or burst the vanished hero's lofty mound;
   Far on the solitary shore he sleeps;
   He fell, and falling nations mourned around;
   But now not one of saddening thousands weeps,
   Nor warlike worshipper his vigil keeps
   Where demi-gods appeared, as records tell.
   Remove yon skull from out the scattered heaps:
   Is that a temple where a God may dwell?
Why, e'en the worm at last disdains her shattered cell!

VI.

   Look on its broken arch, its ruined wall,
   Its chambers desolate, and portals foul:
   Yes, this was once Ambition's airy hall,
   The dome of Thought, the Palace of the Soul.
   Behold through each lack-lustre, eyeless hole,
   The gay recess of Wisdom and of Wit,
   And Passion's host, that never brooked control:
   Can all saint, sage, or sophist ever writ,
People this lonely tower, this tenement refit?

VII.

   Well didst thou speak, Athena's wisest son!
   'All that we know is, nothing can be known.'
   Why should we shrink from what we cannot shun?
   Each hath its pang, but feeble sufferers groan
   With brain-born dreams of evil all their own.
   Pursue what chance or fate proclaimeth best;
   Peace waits us on the shores of Acheron:
   There no forced banquet claims the sated guest,
But Silence spreads the couch of ever welcome rest.

VIII.

   Yet if, as holiest men have deemed, there be
   A land of souls beyond that sable shore,
   To shame the doctrine of the Sadducee
   And sophists, madly vain of dubious lore;
   How sweet it were in concert to adore
   With those who made our mortal labours light!
   To hear each voice we feared to hear no more!
   Behold each mighty shade revealed to sight,
The Bactrian, Samian sage, and all who taught the right!

IX.

   There, thou!--whose love and life together fled,
   Have left me here to love and live in vain -
   Twined with my heart, and can I deem thee dead,
   When busy memory flashes on my brain?
   Well--I will dream that we may meet again,
   And woo the vision to my vacant breast:
   If aught of young Remembrance then remain,
   Be as it may Futurity's behest,
For me 'twere bliss enough to know thy spirit blest!

X.

   Here let me sit upon this mossy stone,
   The marble column's yet unshaken base!
   Here, son of Saturn, was thy favourite throne!
   Mightiest of many such!  Hence let me trace
   The latent grandeur of thy dwelling-place.
   It may not be:  nor even can Fancy's eye
   Restore what time hath laboured to deface.
   Yet these proud pillars claim no passing sigh;
Unmoved the Moslem sits, the light Greek carols by.

XI.

   But who, of all the plunderers of yon fane
   On high, where Pallas lingered, loth to flee
   The latest relic of her ancient reign -
   The last, the worst, dull spoiler, who was he?
   Blush, Caledonia! such thy son could be!
   England!  I joy no child he was of thine:
   Thy free-born men should spare what once was free;
   Yet they could violate each saddening shrine,
And bear these altars o'er the long reluctant brine.

XII.

   But most the modern Pict's ignoble boast,
   To rive what Goth, and Turk, and Time hath spared:
   Cold as the crags upon his native coast,
   His mind as barren and his heart as hard,
   Is he whose head conceived, whose hand prepared,
   Aught to displace Athena's poor remains:
   Her sons too weak the sacred shrine to guard,
   Yet felt some portion of their mother's pains,
And never knew, till then, the weight of Despot's chains.

XIII.

   What! shall it e'er be said by British tongue
   Albion was happy in Athena's tears?
   Though in thy name the slaves her bosom wrung,
   Tell not the deed to blushing Europe's ears;
   The ocean queen, the free Britannia, bears
   The last poor plunder from a bleeding land:
   Yes, she, whose generous aid her name endears,
   Tore down those remnants with a harpy's hand.
Which envious eld forbore, and tyrants left to stand.

XIV.

   Where was thine aegis, Pallas, that appalled
   Stern Alaric and Havoc on their way?
   Where Peleus' son? whom Hell in vain enthralled,
   His shade from Hades upon that dread day
   Bursting to light in terrible array!
   What! could not Pluto spare the chief once more,
   To scare a second robber from his prey?
   Idly he wandered on the Stygian shore,
Nor now preserved the walls he loved to shield before.

XV.

   Cold is the heart, fair Greece, that looks on thee,
   Nor feels as lovers o'er the dust they loved;
   Dull is the eye that will not weep to see
   Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed
   By British hands, which it had best behoved
   To guard those relics ne'er to be restored.
   Curst be the hour when from their isle they roved,
   And once again thy hapless bosom gored,
And snatched thy shrinking gods to northern climes abhorred!

XVI.

   But where is Harold? shall I then forget
   To urge the gloomy wanderer o'er the wave?
   Little recked he of all that men regret;
   No loved one now in feigned lament could rave;
   No friend the parting hand extended gave,
   Ere the cold stranger passed to other climes.
   Hard is his heart whom charms may not enslave;
   But Harold felt not as in other times,
And left without a sigh the land of war and crimes.

XVII.

   He that has sailed upon the dark blue sea,
   Has viewed at times, I ween, a full fair sight;
   When the fresh breeze is fair as breeze may be,
   The white sails set, the gallant frigate tight,
   Masts, spires, and strand retiring to the right,
   The glorious main expanding o'er the bow,
   The convoy spread like wild swans in their flight,
   The dullest sailer wearing bravely now,
So gaily curl the waves before each dashing prow.

XVIII.

   And oh, the little warlike world within!
   The well-reeved guns, the netted canopy,
   The hoarse command, the busy humming din,
   When, at a word, the tops are manned on high:
   Hark to the boatswain's call, the cheering cry,
   While through the seaman's hand the tackle glides
   Or schoolboy midshipman that, standing by,
   Strains his shrill pipe, as good or ill betides,
And well the docile crew that skilful urchin guides.

XIX.

   White is the glassy deck, without a stain,
   Where on the watch the staid lieutenant walks:
   Look on that part which sacred doth remain
   For the lone chieftain, who majestic stalks,
   Silent and feared by all:  not oft he talks
   With aught beneath him, if he would preserve
   That strict restraint, which broken, ever baulks
   Conquest and Fame:  but Britons rarely swerve
From law, however stern, which tends their strength to nerve.

XX.

   Blow, swiftly blow, thou keel-compelling gale,
   Till the broad sun withdraws his lessening ray;
   Then must the pennant-bearer slacken sail,
   That lagging barks may make their lazy way.
   Ah! grievance sore, and listless dull delay,
   To waste on sluggish hulks the sweetest breeze!
   What leagues are lost before the dawn of day,
   Thus loitering pensive on the willing seas,
The flapping sails hauled down to halt for logs like these!

XXI.

   The moon is up; by Heaven, a lovely eve!
   Long streams of light o'er dancing waves expand!
   Now lads on shore may sigh, and maids believe:
   Such be our fate when we return to land!
   Meantime some rude Arion's restless hand
   Wakes the brisk harmony that sailors love:
   A circle there of merry listeners stand,
   Or to some well-known measure featly move,
Thoughtless, as if on shore they still were free to rove.

XXII.

   Through Calpe's straits survey the steepy shore;
   Europe and Afric, on each other gaze!
   Lands of the dark-eyed maid and dusky Moor,
   Alike beheld beneath pale Hecate's blaze:
   How softly on the Spanish shore she plays,
   Disclosing rock, and slope, and forest brown,
   Distinct, though darkening with her waning phase:
   But Mauritania's giant-shadows frown,
From mountain-cliff to coast descending sombre down.

XXIII.

   'Tis night, when Meditation bids us feel
   We once have loved, though love is at an end:
   The heart, lone mourner of its baffled zeal,
   Though friendless now, will dream it had a friend.
   Who with the weight of years would wish to bend,
   When Youth itself survives young Love and Joy?
   Alas! when mingling souls forget to blend,
   Death hath but little left him to destroy!
Ah, happy years! once more who would not be a boy?

XXIV.

   Thus bending o'er the vessel's laving side,
   To gaze on Dian's wave-reflected sphere,
   The soul forgets her schemes of Hope and Pride,
   And flies unconscious o'er each backward year.
   None are so desolate but something dear,
   Dearer than self, possesses or possessed
   A thought, and claims the homage of a tear;
   A flashing pang! of which the weary breast
Would still, albeit in vain, the heavy heart divest.

XXV.

   To sit on rocks, to muse o'er flood and fell,
   To slowly trace the forest's shady scene,
   Where things that own not man's dominion dwell,
   And mortal foot hath ne'er or rarely been;
   To climb the trackless mountain all unseen,
   With the wild flock that never needs a fold;
   Alone o'er steeps and foaming falls to lean:
   This is not solitude; 'tis but to hold
Converse with Nature's charms, and view her stores unrolled.

XXVI.

   But midst the crowd, the hum, the shock of men,
   To hear, to see, to feel, and to possess,
   And roam along, the world's tired denizen,
   With none who bless us, none whom we can bless;
   Minions of splendour shrinking from distress!
   None that, with kindred consciousness endued,
   If we were not, would seem to smile the less
   Of all that flattered, followed, sought, and sued:
This is to be alone; this, this is solitude!

XXVII.

   More blest the life of godly eremite,
   Such as on lonely Athos may be seen,
   Watching at eve upon the giant height,
   Which looks o'er waves so blue, skies so serene,
   That he who there at such an hour hath been,
   Will wistful linger on that hallowed spot;
   Then slowly tear him from the witching scene,
   Sigh forth one wish that such had been his lot,
Then turn to hate a world he had almost forgot.

XXVIII.

   Pass we the long, unvarying course, the track
   Oft trod, that never leaves a trace behind;
   Pass we the calm, the gale, the change, the tack,
   And each well-known caprice of wave and wind;
   Pass we the joys and sorrows sailors find,
   Cooped in their winged sea-girt citadel;
   The foul, the fair, the contrary, the kind,
   As breezes rise and fall, and billows swell,
Till on some jocund morn--lo, land! and all is well.

XXIX.

   But not in silence pass Calypso's isles,
   The sister tenants of the middle deep;
   There for the weary still a haven smiles,
   Though the fair goddess long has ceased to weep,
   And o'er her cliffs a fruitless watch to keep
   For him who dared prefer a mortal bride:
   Here, too, his boy essayed the dreadful leap
   Stern Mentor urged from high to yonder tide;
While thus of both bereft, the nymph-queen doubly sighed.

XXX.

   Her reign is past, her gentle glories gone:
   But trust not this; too easy youth, beware!
   A mortal sovereign holds her dangerous throne,
   And thou mayst find a new Calypso there.
   Sweet Florence! could another ever share
   This wayward, loveless heart, it would be thine:
   But checked by every tie, I may not dare
   To cast a worthless offering at thy shrine,
Nor ask so dear a breast to feel one pang for mine.

XXXI.

   Thus Harold deemed, as on that lady's eye
   He looked, and met its beam without a thought,
   Save Admiration glancing harmless by:
   Love kept aloof, albeit not far remote,
   Who knew his votary often lost and caught,
   But knew him as his worshipper no more,
   And ne'er again the boy his bosom sought:
   Since now he vainly urged him to adore,
Well deemed the little god his ancient sway was o'er.

XXXII.

   Fair Florence found, in sooth with some amaze,
   One who, 'twas said, still sighed to all he saw,
   Withstand, unmoved, the lustre of her gaze,
   Which others hailed with real or mimic awe,
   Their hope, their doom, their punishment, their law:
   All that gay Beauty from her bondsmen claims:
   And much she marvelled that a youth so raw
   Nor felt, nor feigned at least, the oft-told flames,
Which, though sometimes they frown, yet rarely anger dames.

XXXIII.

   Little knew she that seeming marble heart,
   Now masked by silence or withheld by pride,
   Was not unskilful in the spoiler's art,
   And spread its snares licentious far and wide;
   Nor from the base pursuit had turned aside,
   As long as aught was worthy to pursue:
   But Harold on such arts no more relied;
   And had he doted on those eyes so blue,
Yet never would he join the lover's whining crew.

XXXIV.

   Not much he kens, I ween, of woman's breast,
   Who thinks that wanton thing is won by sighs;
   What careth she for hearts when once possessed?
   Do proper homage to thine idol's eyes,
   But not too humbly, or she will despise
   Thee and thy suit, though told in moving tropes;
   Disguise e'en tenderness, if thou art wise;
   Brisk Confidence still best with woman copes;
Pique her and soothe in turn, soon Passion crowns thy hopes.

XXXV.

   'Tis an old lesson:  Time approves it true,
   And those who know it best deplore it most;
   When all is won that all desire to woo,
   The paltry prize is hardly worth the cost:
   Youth wasted, minds degraded, honour lost,
   These are thy fruits, successful Passion! these!
   If, kindly cruel, early hope is crossed,
   Still to the last it rankles, a disease,
Not to be cured when Love itself forgets to please.

XXXVI.

   Away! nor let me loiter in my song,
   For we have many a mountain path to tread,
   And many a varied shore to sail along,
   By pensive Sadness, not by Fiction, led -
   Climes, fair withal as ever mortal head
   Imagined in its little schemes of thought;
   Or e'er in new Utopias were read:
   To teach man what he might be, or he ought;
If that corrupted thing could ever such be taught.

XXXVII.

   Dear Nature is the kindest mother still;
   Though always changing, in her aspect mild:
   From her bare bosom let me take my fill,
   Her never-weaned, though not her favoured child.
   Oh! she is fairest in her features wild,
   Where nothing polished dares pollute her path:
   To me by day or night she ever smiled,
   Though I have marked her when none other hath,
And sought her more and more, and loved her best in wrath.

XXXVIII.

   Land of Albania! where Iskander rose;
   Theme of the young, and beacon of the wise,
   And he his namesake, whose oft-baffled foes,
   Shrunk from his deeds of chivalrous emprise:
   Land of Albania! let me bend mine eyes
   On thee, thou rugged nurse of savage men!
   The cross descends, thy minarets arise,
   And the pale crescent sparkles in the glen,
Through many a cypress grove within each city's ken.

XXXIX.

   Childe Harold sailed, and passed the barren spot
   Where sad Penelope o'erlooked the wave;
   And onward viewed the mount, not yet forgot,
   The lover's refuge, and the Lesbian's grave.
   Dark Sappho! could not verse immortal save
   That breast imbued with such immortal fire?
   Could she not live who life eternal gave?
   If life eternal may await the lyre,
That only Heaven to which Earth's children may aspire.

XL.

   'Twas on a Grecian autumn's gentle eve,
   Childe Harold hailed Leucadia's cape afar;
   A spot he longed to see, nor cared to leave:
   Oft did he mark the scenes of vanished war,
   Actium, Lepanto, fatal Trafalgar:
   Mark them unmoved, for he would not delight
   (Born beneath some remote inglorious star)
   In themes of bloody fray, or gallant fight,
But loathed the bravo's trade, and laughed at martial wight.

XLI.

   But when he saw the evening star above
   Leucadia's far-projecting rock of woe,
   And hailed the last resort of fruitless love,
   He felt, or deemed he felt, no common glow:
   And as the stately vessel glided slow
   Beneath the shadow of that ancient mount,
   He watched the billows' melancholy flow,
   And, sunk albeit in thought as he was wont,
More placid seemed his eye, and smooth his pallid front.

XLII.

   Morn dawns; and with it stern Albania's hills,
   Dark Suli's rocks, and Pindus' inland peak,
   Robed half in mist, bedewed with snowy rills,
   Arrayed in many a dun and purple streak,
   Arise; and, as the clouds along them break,
   Disclose the dwelling of the mountaineer;
   Here roams the wolf, the eagle whets his beak,
   Birds, beasts of prey, and wilder men appear,
And gathering storms around convulse the closing year.

XLIII.

   Now Harold felt himself at length alone,
   And bade to Christian tongues a long adieu:
   Now he adventured on a shore unknown,
   Which all admire, but many dread to view:
   His breast was armed 'gainst fate, his wants were few:
   Peril he sought not, but ne'er shrank to meet:
   The scene was savage, but the scene was new;
   This made the ceaseless toil of travel sweet,
Beat back keen winter's blast; and welcomed summer's heat.

XLIV.

   Here the red cross, for still the cross is here,
   Though sadly scoffed at by the circumcised,
   Forgets that pride to pampered priesthood dear;
   Churchman and votary alike despised.
   Foul Superstition! howsoe'er disguised,
   Idol, saint, virgin, prophet, crescent, cross,
   For whatsoever symbol thou art prized,
   Thou sacerdotal gain, but general loss!
Who from true worship's gold can separate thy dross.

XLV.

   Ambracia's gulf behold, where once was lost
   A world for woman, lovely, harmless thing!
   In yonder rippling bay, their naval host
   Did many a Roman chief and Asian king
   To doubtful conflict, certain slaughter, bring
   Look where the second Caesar's trophies rose,
   Now, like the hands that reared them, withering;
   Imperial anarchs, doubling human woes!
God! was thy globe ordained for such to win and lose?

XLVI.

   From the dark barriers of that rugged clime,
   E'en to the centre of Illyria's vales,
   Childe Harold passed o'er many a mount sublime,
   Through lands scarce noticed in historic tales:
   Yet in famed Attica such lovely dales
   Are rarely seen; nor can fair Tempe boast
   A charm they know not; loved Parnassus fails,
   Though classic ground, and consecrated most,
To match some spots that lurk within this lowering coast.

XLVII.

   He passed bleak Pindus, Acherusia's lake,
   And left the primal city of the land,
   And onwards did his further journey take
   To greet Albania's chief, whose dread command
   Is lawless law; for with a bloody hand
   He sways a nation, turbulent and bold:
   Yet here and there some daring mountain-band
   Disdain his power, and from their rocky hold
Hurl their defiance far, nor yield, unless to gold.

XLVIII.

   Monastic Zitza! from thy shady brow,
   Thou small, but favoured spot of holy ground!
   Where'er we gaze, around, above, below,
   What rainbow tints, what magic charms are found!
   Rock, river, forest, mountain all abound,
   And bluest skies that harmonise the whole:
   Beneath, the distant torrent's rushing sound
   Tells where the volumed cataract doth roll
Between those hanging rocks, that shock yet please the soul.

XLIX.

   Amidst the grove that crowns yon tufted hill,
   Which, were it not for many a mountain nigh
   Rising in lofty ranks, and loftier still,
   Might well itself be deemed of dignity,
   The convent's white walls glisten fair on high;
   Here dwells the caloyer, nor rude is he,
   Nor niggard of his cheer:  the passer-by
   Is welcome still; nor heedless will he flee
From hence, if he delight kind Nature's sheen to see.

L.

   Here in the sultriest season let him rest,
   Fresh is the green beneath those aged trees;
   Here winds of gentlest wing will fan his breast,
   From heaven itself he may inhale the breeze:
   The plain is far beneath--oh! let him seize
   Pure pleasure while he can; the scorching ray
   Here pierceth not, impregnate with disease:
   Then let his length the loitering pilgrim lay,
And gaze, untired, the morn, the noon, the eve away.

LI.

   Dusky and huge, enlarging on the sight,
   Nature's volcanic amphitheatre,
   Chimera's alps extend from left to right:
   Beneath, a living valley seems to stir;
   Flocks play, trees wave, streams flow, the mountain fir
   Nodding above; behold black Acheron!
   Once consecrated to the sepulchre.
   Pluto! if this be hell I look upon,
Close shamed Elysium's gates, my shade shall seek for none.

LII.

   No city's towers pollute the lovely view;
   Unseen is Yanina, though not remote,
   Veiled by the screen of hills:  here men are few,
   Scanty the hamlet, rare the lonely cot;
   But, peering down each precipice, the goat
   Browseth:  and, pensive o'er his scattered flock,
   The little shepherd in his white capote
   Doth lean his boyish form along the rock,
Or in his cave awaits the tempest's short-lived shock.

LIII.

   Oh! where, Dodona, is thine aged grove,
   Prophetic fount, and oracle divine?
   What valley echoed the response of Jove?
   What trace remaineth of the Thunderer's shrine?
   All, all forgotten--and shall man repine
   That his frail bonds to fleeting life are broke?
   Cease, fool! the fate of gods may well be thine:
   Wouldst thou survive the marble or the oak,
When nations, tongues, and worlds must sink beneath the stroke?

LIV.

   Epirus' bounds recede, and mountains fail;
   Tired of up-gazing still, the wearied eye
   Reposes gladly on as smooth a vale
   As ever Spring yclad in grassy dye:
   E'en on a plain no humble beauties lie,
   Where some bold river breaks the long expanse,
   And woods along the banks are waving high,
   Whose shadows in the glassy waters dance,
Or with the moonbeam sleep in Midnight's solemn trance.

LV.

   The sun had sunk behind vast Tomerit,
   The Laos wide and fierce came roaring by;
   The shades of wonted night were gathering yet,
   When, down the steep banks winding wearily
   Childe Harold saw, like meteors in the sky,
   The glittering minarets of Tepalen,
   Whose walls o'erlook the stream; and drawing nigh,
   He heard the busy hum of warrior-men
Swelling the breeze that sighed along the lengthening glen.

LVI.

   He passed the sacred harem's silent tower,
   And underneath the wide o'erarching gate
   Surveyed the dwelling of this chief of power
   Where all around proclaimed his high estate.
   Amidst no common pomp the despot sate,
   While busy preparation shook the court;
   Slaves, eunuchs, soldiers, guests, and santons wait;
   Within, a palace, and without a fort,
Here men of every clime appear to make resort.

LVII.

   Richly caparisoned, a ready row
   Of armed horse, and many a warlike store,
   Circled the wide-extending court below;
   Above, strange groups adorned the corridor;
   And ofttimes through the area's echoing door,
   Some high-capped Tartar spurred his steed away;
   The Turk, the Greek, the Albanian, and the Moor,
   Here mingled in their many-hued array,
While the deep war-drum's sound announced the close of day.

LVIII.

   The wild Albanian kirtled to his knee,
   With shawl-girt head and ornamented gun,
   And gold-embroidered garments, fair to see:
   The crimson-scarfed men of Macedon;
   The Delhi with his cap of terror on,
   And crooked glaive; the lively, supple Greek;
   And swarthy Nubia's mutilated son;
   The bearded Turk, that rarely deigns to speak,
Master of all around, too potent to be meek,

LIX.

   Are mixed conspicuous:  some recline in groups,
   Scanning the motley scene that varies round;
   There some grave Moslem to devotion stoops,
   And some that smoke, and some that play are found;
   Here the Albanian proudly treads the ground;
   Half-whispering there the Greek is heard to prate;
   Hark! from the mosque the nightly solemn sound,
   The muezzin's call doth shake the minaret,
'There is no god but God!--to prayer--lo! God is great!'

LX.

   Just at this season Ramazani's fast
   Through the long day its penance did maintain.
   But when the lingering twilight hour was past,
   Revel and feast assumed the rule again:
   Now all was bustle, and the menial train
   Prepared and spread the plenteous board within;
   The vacant gallery now seemed made in vain,
   But from the chambers came the mingling din,
As page and slave anon were passing out and in.

LXI.

   Here woman's voice is never heard:  apart
   And scarce permitted, guarded, veiled, to move,
   She yields to one her person and her heart,
   Tamed to her cage, nor feels a wish to rove;
   For, not unhappy in her master's love,
   And joyful in a mother's gentlest cares,
   Blest cares! all other feelings far above!
   Herself more sweetly rears the babe she bears,
Who never quits the breast, no meaner passion shares.

LXII.

   In marble-paved pavilion, where a spring
   Of living water from the centre rose,
   Whose bubbling did a genial freshness fling,
   And soft voluptuous couches breathed repose,
   Ali reclined, a man of war and woes:
   Yet in his lineaments ye cannot trace,
   While Gentleness her milder radiance throws
   Along that aged venerable face,
The deeds that lurk beneath, and stain him with disgrace.

LXIII.

   It is not that yon hoary lengthening beard
   Ill suits the passions which belong to youth:
   Love conquers age--so Hafiz hath averred,
   So sings the Teian, and he sings in sooth -
   But crimes that scorn the tender voice of ruth,
   Beseeming all men ill, but most the man
   In years, have marked him with a tiger's tooth:
   Blood follows blood, and through their mortal span,
In bloodier acts conclude those who with blood began.

LXIV.

   Mid many things most new to ear and eye,
   The pilgrim rested here his weary feet,
   And gazed around on Moslem luxury,
   Till quickly wearied with that spacious seat
   Of Wealth and Wantonness, the choice retreat
   Of sated Grandeur from the city's noise:
   And were it humbler, it in sooth were sweet;
   But Peace abhorreth artificial joys,
And Pleasure, leagued with Pomp, the zest of both destroys.

LXV.

   Fierce are Albania's children, yet they lack
   Not virtues, were those virtues more mature.
   Where is the foe that ever saw their back?
   Who can so well the toil of war endure?
   Their native fastnesses not more secure
   Than they in doubtful time of troublous need:
   Their wrath how deadly! but their friendship sure,
   When Gratitude or Valour bids them bleed,
Unshaken rushing on where'er their chief may lead.

LXVI.

   Childe Harold saw them in their chieftain's tower,
   Thronging to war in splendour and success;
   And after viewed them, when, within their power,
   Himself awhile the victim of distress;
   That saddening hour when bad men hotlier press:
   But these did shelter him beneath their roof,
   When less barbarians would have cheered him less,
   And fellow-countrymen have stood aloof -
In aught that tries the heart how few withstand the proof!

LXVII.

   It chanced that adverse winds once drove his bark
   Full on the coast of Suli's shaggy shore,
   When all around was desolate and dark;
   To land was perilous, to sojourn more;
   Yet for awhile the mariners forbore,
   Dubious to trust where treachery might lurk:
   At length they ventured forth, though doubting sore
   That those who loathe alike the Frank and Turk
Might once again renew their ancient butcher-work.

LXVIII.

   Vain fear! the Suliotes stretched the welcome hand,
   Led them o'er rocks and past the dangerous swamp,
   Kinder than polished slaves, though not so bland,
   And piled the hearth, and wrung their garments damp,
   And filled the bowl, and trimmed the cheerful lamp,
   And spread their fare:  though homely, all they had:
   Such conduct bears Philanthropy's rare stamp -
   To rest the weary and to soothe the sad,
Doth lesson happier men, and shames at least the bad.

LXIX.

   It came to pass, that when he did address
   Himself to quit at length this mountain land,
   Combined marauders half-way barred egress,
   And wasted far and near with glaive and brand;
   And therefore did he take a trusty band
   To traverse Acarnania forest wide,
   In war well-seasoned, and with labours tanned,
   Till he did greet white Achelous' tide,
And from his farther bank AEtolia's wolds espied.

LXX.

   Where lone Utraikey forms its circling cove,
   And weary waves retire to gleam at rest,
   How brown the foliage of the green hill's grove,
   Nodding at midnight o'er the calm bay's breast,
   As winds come whispering lightly from the west,
   Kissing, not ruffling, the blue deep's serene:
   Here Harold was received a welcome guest;
   Nor did he pass unmoved the gentle scene,
For many a joy could he from night's soft presence glean.

LXXI.

   On the smooth shore the night-fires brightly blazed,
   The feast was done, the red wine circling fast,
   And he that unawares had there ygazed
   With gaping wonderment had stared aghast;
   For ere night's midmost, stillest hour was past,
   The native revels of the troop began;
   Each palikar his sabre from him cast,
   And bounding hand in hand, man linked to man,
Yelling their uncouth dirge, long danced the kirtled clan.

LXXII.

   Childe Harold at a little distance stood,
   And viewed, but not displeased, the revelrie,
   Nor hated harmless mirth, however rude:
   In sooth, it was no vulgar sight to see
   Their barbarous, yet their not indecent, glee:
   And as the flames along their faces gleamed,
   Their gestures nimble, dark eyes flashing free,
   The long wild locks that to their girdles streamed,
While thus in concert they this lay half sang, half screamed:


Tambourgi! Tambourgi! thy larum afar
Gives hope to the valiant, and promise of war;
All the sons of the mountains arise at the note,
Chimariot, Illyrian, and dark Suliote!

Oh! who is more brave than a dark Suliote,
To his snowy camese and his shaggy capote?
To the wolf and the vulture he leaves his wild flock,
And descends to the plain like the stream from the rock.

Shall the sons of Chimari, who never forgive
The fault of a friend, bid an enemy live?
Let those guns so unerring such vengeance forego?
What mark is so fair as the breast of a foe?

Macedonia sends forth her invincible race;
For a time they abandon the cave and the chase:
But those scarves of blood-red shall be redder, before
The sabre is sheathed and the battle is o'er.

Then the pirates of Parga that dwell by the waves,
And teach the pale Franks what it is to be slaves,
Shall leave on the beach the long galley and oar,
And track to his covert the captive on shore.

I ask not the pleasure that riches supply,
My sabre shall win what the feeble must buy:
Shall win the young bride with her long flowing hair,
And many a maid from her mother shall tear.

I love the fair face of the maid in her youth;
Her caresses shall lull me, her music shall soothe:
Let her bring from her chamber the many-toned lyre,
And sing us a song on the fall of her sire.

Remember the moment when Previsa fell,
The shrieks of the conquered, the conqueror's yell;
The roofs that we fired, and the plunder we shared,
The wealthy we slaughtered, the lovely we spared.

I talk not of mercy, I talk not of fear;
He neither must know who would serve the Vizier;
Since the days of our prophet, the crescent ne'er saw
A chief ever glorious like Ali Pasha.

Dark Muchtar his son to the Danube is sped,
Let the yellow-haired Giaours view his horsetail with dread;
When his Delhis come dashing in blood o'er the banks,
How few shall escape from the Muscovite ranks!

Selictar! unsheath then our chief's scimitar:
Tambourgi! thy larum gives promise of war.
Ye mountains that see us descend to the shore,
Shall view us as victors, or view us no more!

LXXIII.

   Fair Greece! sad relic of departed worth!
   Immortal, though no more; though fallen, great!
   Who now shall lead thy scattered children forth,
   And long accustomed bondage uncreate?
   Not such thy sons who whilome did await,
   The hopeless warriors of a willing doom,
   In bleak Thermopylae's sepulchral strait -
   Oh, who that gallant spirit shall resume,
Leap from Eurotas' banks, and call thee from the tomb?

LXXIV.

   Spirit of Freedom! when on Phyle's brow
   Thou sat'st with Thrasybulus and his train,
   Couldst thou forbode the dismal hour which now
   Dims the green beauties of thine Attic plain?
   Not thirty tyrants now enforce the chain,
   But every carle can lord it o'er thy land;
   Nor rise thy sons, but idly rail in vain,
   Trembling beneath the scourge of Turkish hand,
From birth till death enslaved; in word, in deed, unmanned.

LXXV.

   In all save form alone, how changed! and who
   That marks the fire still sparkling in each eye,
   Who would but deem their bosom burned anew
   With thy unquenched beam, lost Liberty!
   And many dream withal the hour is nigh
   That gives them back their fathers' heritage:
   For foreign arms and aid they fondly sigh,
   Nor solely dare encounter hostile rage,
Or tear their name defiled from Slavery's mournful page.

LXXVI.

   Hereditary bondsmen! know ye not
   Who would be free themselves must strike the blow?
   By their right arms the conquest must be wrought?
   Will Gaul or Muscovite redress ye?  No!
   True, they may lay your proud despoilers low,
   But not for you will Freedom's altars flame.
   Shades of the Helots! triumph o'er your foe:
   Greece! change thy lords, thy state is still the same;
Thy glorious day is o'er, but not thy years of shame.

LXXVII.

   The city won for Allah from the Giaour,
   The Giaour from Othman's race again may wrest;
   And the Serai's impenetrable tower
   Receive the fiery Frank, her former guest;
   Or Wahab's rebel brood, who dared divest
   The Prophet's tomb of all its pious spoil,
   May wind their path of blood along the West;
   But ne'er will Freedom seek this fated soil,
But slave succeed to slave through years of endless toil.

LXXVIII.

   Yet mark their mirth--ere lenten days begin,
   That penance which their holy rites prepare
   To shrive from man his weight of mortal sin,
   By daily abstinence and nightly prayer;
   But ere his sackcloth garb Repentance wear,
   Some days of joyaunce are decreed to all,
   To take of pleasaunce each his secret share,
   In motley robe to dance at masking ball,
And join the mimic train of merry Carnival.

LXXIX.

   And whose more rife with merriment than thine,
   O Stamboul! once the empress of their reign?
   Though turbans now pollute Sophia's shrine
   And Greece her very altars eyes in vain:
   (Alas! her woes will still pervade my strain!)
   Gay were her minstrels once, for free her throng,
   All felt the common joy they now must feign;
   Nor oft I've seen such sight, nor heard such song,
As wooed the eye, and thrilled the Bosphorus along.

LXXX.

   Loud was the lightsome tumult on the shore;
   Oft Music changed, but never ceased her tone,
   And timely echoed back the measured oar,
   And rippling waters made a pleasant moan:
   The Queen of tides on high consenting shone;
   And when a transient breeze swept o'er the wave,
   'Twas as if, darting from her heavenly throne,
   A brighter glance her form reflected gave,
Till sparkling billows seemed to light the banks they lave.

LXXXI.

   Glanced many a light caique along the foam,
   Danced on the shore the daughters of the land,
   No thought had man or maid of rest or home,
   While many a languid eye and thrilling hand
   Exchanged the look few bosoms may withstand,
   Or gently pressed, returned the pressure still:
   Oh Love! young Love! bound in thy rosy band,
   Let sage or cynic prattle as he will,
These hours, and only these, redeemed Life's years of ill!

LXXXII.

   But, midst the throng in merry masquerade,
   Lurk there no hearts that throb with secret pain,
   E'en through the closest searment half-betrayed?
   To such the gentle murmurs of the main
   Seem to re-echo all they mourn in vain;
   To such the gladness of the gamesome crowd
   Is source of wayward thought and stern disdain:
   How do they loathe the laughter idly loud,
And long to change the robe of revel for the shroud!

LXXXIII.

   This must he feel, the true-born son of Greece,
   If Greece one true-born patriot can boast:
   Not such as prate of war but skulk in peace,
   The bondsman's peace, who sighs for all he lost,
   Yet with smooth smile his tyrant can accost,
   And wield the slavish sickle, not the sword:
   Ah, Greece! they love thee least who owe thee most -
   Their birth, their blood, and that sublime record
Of hero sires, who shame thy now degenerate horde!

LXXXIV.

   When riseth Lacedaemon's hardihood,
   When Thebes Epaminondas rears again,
   When Athens' children are with hearts endued,
   When Grecian mothers shall give birth to men,
   Then mayst thou be restored; but not till then.
   A thousand years scarce serve to form a state;
   An hour may lay it in the dust:  and when
   Can man its shattered splendour renovate,
Recall its virtues back, and vanquish Time and Fate?

LXXXV.

   And yet how lovely in thine age of woe,
   Land of lost gods and godlike men, art thou!
   Thy vales of evergreen, thy hills of snow,
   Proclaim thee Nature's varied favourite now;
   Thy fanes, thy temples to the surface bow,
   Commingling slowly with heroic earth,
   Broke by the share of every rustic plough:
   So perish monuments of mortal birth,
So perish all in turn, save well-recorded worth;

LXXXVI.

   Save where some solitary column mourns
   Above its prostrate brethren of the cave;
   Save where Tritonia's airy shrine adorns
   Colonna's cliff, and gleams along the wave;
   Save o'er some warrior's half-forgotten grave,
   Where the grey stones and unmolested grass
   Ages, but not oblivion, feebly brave,
   While strangers only not regardless pass,
Lingering like me, perchance, to gaze, and sigh 'Alas!'

LXXXVII.

   Yet are thy skies as blue, thy crags as wild:
   Sweet are thy groves, and verdant are thy fields,
   Thine olives ripe as when Minerva smiled,
   And still his honeyed wealth Hymettus yields;
   There the blithe bee his fragrant fortress builds,
   The freeborn wanderer of thy mountain air;
   Apollo still thy long, long summer gilds,
   Still in his beam Mendeli's marbles glare;
Art, Glory, Freedom fail, but Nature still is fair.

LXXXVIII.

   Where'er we tread, 'tis haunted, holy ground;
   No earth of thine is lost in vulgar mould,
   But one vast realm of wonder spreads around,
   And all the Muse's tales seem truly told,
   Till the sense aches with gazing to behold
   The scenes our earliest dreams have dwelt upon:
   Each hill and dale, each deepening glen and wold,
   Defies the power which crushed thy temples gone:
Age shakes Athena's tower, but spares gray Marathon.

LXXXIX.

   The sun, the soil, but not the slave, the same;
   Unchanged in all except its foreign lord -
   Preserves alike its bounds and boundless fame;
   The battle-field, where Persia's victim horde
   First bowed beneath the brunt of Hellas' sword,
   As on the morn to distant Glory dear,
   When Marathon became a magic word;
   Which uttered, to the hearer's eye appear
The camp, the host, the fight, the conqueror's career.

XC.

   The flying Mede, his shaftless broken bow;
   The fiery Greek, his red pursuing spear;
   Mountains above, Earth's, Ocean's plain below;
   Death in the front, Destruction in the rear!
   Such was the scene--what now remaineth here?
   What sacred trophy marks the hallowed ground,
   Recording Freedom's smile and Asia's tear?
   The rifled urn, the violated mound,
The dust thy courser's hoof, rude stranger! spurns around.

XCI.

   Yet to the remnants of thy splendour past
   Shall pilgrims, pensive, but unwearied, throng:
   Long shall the voyager, with th' Ionian blast,
   Hail the bright clime of battle and of song;
   Long shall thine annals and immortal tongue
   Fill with thy fame the youth of many a shore:
   Boast of the aged! lesson of the young!
   Which sages venerate and bards adore,
As Pallas and the Muse unveil their awful lore.

XCII.

   The parted bosom clings to wonted home,
   If aught that's kindred cheer the welcome hearth;
   He that is lonely, hither let him roam,
   And gaze complacent on congenial earth.
   Greece is no lightsome land of social mirth;
   But he whom Sadness sootheth may abide,
   And scarce regret the region of his birth,
   When wandering slow by Delphi's sacred side,
Or gazing o'er the plains where Greek and Persian died.

XCIII.

   Let such approach this consecrated land,
   And pass in peace along the magic waste:
   But spare its relics--let no busy hand
   Deface the scenes, already how defaced!
   Not for such purpose were these altars placed.
   Revere the remnants nations once revered;
   So may our country's name be undisgraced,
   So mayst thou prosper where thy youth was reared,
By every honest joy of love and life endeared!

XCIV.

   For thee, who thus in too protracted song
   Hath soothed thine idlesse with inglorious lays,
   Soon shall thy voice be lost amid the throng
   Of louder minstrels in these later days:
   To such resign the strife for fading bays -
   Ill may such contest now the spirit move
   Which heeds nor keen reproach nor partial praise,
   Since cold each kinder heart that might approve,
And none are left to please where none are left to love.

XCV.

   Thou too art gone, thou loved and lovely one!
   Whom youth and youth's affections bound to me;
   Who did for me what none beside have done,
   Nor shrank from one albeit unworthy thee.
   What is my being? thou hast ceased to be!
   Nor stayed to welcome here thy wanderer home,
   Who mourns o'er hours which we no more shall see -
   Would they had never been, or were to come!
Would he had ne'er returned to find fresh cause to roam!

XCVI.

   Oh! ever loving, lovely, and beloved!
   How selfish Sorrow ponders on the past,
   And clings to thoughts now better far removed!
   But Time shall tear thy shadow from me last.
   All thou couldst have of mine, stern Death, thou hast:
   The parent, friend, and now the more than friend;
   Ne'er yet for one thine arrows flew so fast,
   And grief with grief continuing still to blend,
Hath snatched the little joy that life had yet to lend.

XCVII.

   Then must I plunge again into the crowd,
   And follow all that Peace disdains to seek?
   Where Revel calls, and Laughter, vainly loud,
   False to the heart, distorts the hollow cheek,
   To leave the flagging spirit doubly weak!
   Still o'er the features, which perforce they cheer,
   To feign the pleasure or conceal the pique;
   Smiles form the channel of a future tear,
Or raise the writhing lip with ill-dissembled sneer.

XCVIII.

   What is the worst of woes that wait on age?
   What stamps the wrinkle deeper on the brow?
   To view each loved one blotted from life's page,
   And be alone on earth, as I am now.
   Before the Chastener humbly let me bow,
   O'er hearts divided and o'er hopes destroyed:
   Roll on, vain days! full reckless may ye flow,
   Since Time hath reft whate'er my soul enjoyed,
And with the ills of eld mine earlier years alloyed.



CANTO THE THIRD.



I.

   Is thy face like thy mother's, my fair child!
   Ada! sole daughter of my house and heart?
   When last I saw thy young blue eyes, they smiled,
   And then we parted,--not as now we part,
   But with a hope. -
                    Awaking with a start,
   The waters heave around me; and on high
   The winds lift up their voices:  I depart,
   Whither I know not; but the hour's gone by,
When Albion's lessening shores could grieve or glad mine eye.

II.

   Once more upon the waters! yet once more!
   And the waves bound beneath me as a steed
   That knows his rider.  Welcome to their roar!
   Swift be their guidance, wheresoe'er it lead!
   Though the strained mast should quiver as a reed,
   And the rent canvas fluttering strew the gale,
   Still must I on; for I am as a weed,
   Flung from the rock, on Ocean's foam, to sail
Where'er the surge may sweep, the tempest's breath prevail.

III.

   In my youth's summer I did sing of One,
   The wandering outlaw of his own dark mind;
   Again I seize the theme, then but begun,
   And bear it with me, as the rushing wind
   Bears the cloud onwards:  in that tale I find
   The furrows of long thought, and dried-up tears,
   Which, ebbing, leave a sterile track behind,
   O'er which all heavily the journeying years
Plod the last sands of life--where not a flower appears.

IV.

   Since my young days of passion--joy, or pain,
   Perchance my heart and harp have lost a string,
   And both may jar:  it may be, that in vain
   I would essay as I have sung to sing.
   Yet, though a dreary strain, to this I cling,
   So that it wean me from the weary dream
   Of selfish grief or gladness--so it fling
   Forgetfulness around me--it shall seem
To me, though to none else, a not ungrateful theme.

V.

   He who, grown aged in this world of woe,
   In deeds, not years, piercing the depths of life,
   So that no wonder waits him; nor below
   Can love or sorrow, fame, ambition, strife,
   Cut to his heart again with the keen knife
   Of silent, sharp endurance:  he can tell
   Why thought seeks refuge in lone caves, yet rife
   With airy images, and shapes which dwell
Still unimpaired, though old, in the soul's haunted cell.

VI.

   'Tis to create, and in creating live
   A being more intense, that we endow
   With form our fancy, gaining as we give
   The life we image, even as I do now.
   What am I?  Nothing:  but not so art thou,
   Soul of my thought! with whom I traverse earth,
   Invisible but gazing, as I glow
   Mixed with thy spirit, blended with thy birth,
And feeling still with thee in my crushed feelings' dearth.

VII.

   Yet must I think less wildly:  I HAVE thought
   Too long and darkly, till my brain became,
   In its own eddy boiling and o'erwrought,
   A whirling gulf of phantasy and flame:
   And thus, untaught in youth my heart to tame,
   My springs of life were poisoned.  'Tis too late!
   Yet am I changed; though still enough the same
   In strength to bear what time cannot abate,
And feed on bitter fruits without accusing fate.

VIII.

   Something too much of this:  but now 'tis past,
   And the spell closes with its silent seal.
   Long-absent Harold reappears at last;
   He of the breast which fain no more would feel,
   Wrung with the wounds which kill not, but ne'er heal;
   Yet Time, who changes all, had altered him
   In soul and aspect as in age:  years steal
   Fire from the mind as vigour from the limb;
And life's enchanted cup but sparkles near the brim.

IX.

   His had been quaffed too quickly, and he found
   The dregs were wormwood; but he filled again,
   And from a purer fount, on holier ground,
   And deemed its spring perpetual; but in vain!
   Still round him clung invisibly a chain
   Which galled for ever, fettering though unseen,
   And heavy though it clanked not; worn with pain,
   Which pined although it spoke not, and grew keen,
Entering with every step he took through many a scene.

X.

   Secure in guarded coldness, he had mixed
   Again in fancied safety with his kind,
   And deemed his spirit now so firmly fixed
   And sheathed with an invulnerable mind,
   That, if no joy, no sorrow lurked behind;
   And he, as one, might midst the many stand
   Unheeded, searching through the crowd to find
   Fit speculation; such as in strange land
He found in wonder-works of God and Nature's hand.

XI.

   But who can view the ripened rose, nor seek
   To wear it? who can curiously behold
   The smoothness and the sheen of beauty's cheek,
   Nor feel the heart can never all grow old?
   Who can contemplate fame through clouds unfold
   The star which rises o'er her steep, nor climb?
   Harold, once more within the vortex rolled
   On with the giddy circle, chasing Time,
Yet with a nobler aim than in his youth's fond prime.

XII.

   But soon he knew himself the most unfit
   Of men to herd with Man; with whom he held
   Little in common; untaught to submit
   His thoughts to others, though his soul was quelled,
   In youth by his own thoughts; still uncompelled,
   He would not yield dominion of his mind
   To spirits against whom his own rebelled;
   Proud though in desolation; which could find
A life within itself, to breathe without mankind.

XIII.

   Where rose the mountains, there to him were friends;
   Where rolled the ocean, thereon was his home;
   Where a blue sky, and glowing clime, extends,
   He had the passion and the power to roam;
   The desert, forest, cavern, breaker's foam,
   Were unto him companionship; they spake
   A mutual language, clearer than the tome
   Of his land's tongue, which he would oft forsake
For nature's pages glassed by sunbeams on the lake.

XIV.

   Like the Chaldean, he could watch the stars,
   Till he had peopled them with beings bright
   As their own beams; and earth, and earth-born jars,
   And human frailties, were forgotten quite:
   Could he have kept his spirit to that flight,
   He had been happy; but this clay will sink
   Its spark immortal, envying it the light
   To which it mounts, as if to break the link
That keeps us from yon heaven which woos us to its brink.

XV.

   But in Man's dwellings he became a thing
   Restless and worn, and stern and wearisome,
   Drooped as a wild-born falcon with clipt wing,
   To whom the boundless air alone were home:
   Then came his fit again, which to o'ercome,
   As eagerly the barred-up bird will beat
   His breast and beak against his wiry dome
   Till the blood tinge his plumage, so the heat
Of his impeded soul would through his bosom eat.

XVI.

   Self-exiled Harold wanders forth again,
   With naught of hope left, but with less of gloom;
   The very knowledge that he lived in vain,
   That all was over on this side the tomb,
   Had made Despair a smilingness assume,
   Which, though 'twere wild--as on the plundered wreck
   When mariners would madly meet their doom
   With draughts intemperate on the sinking deck -
Did yet inspire a cheer, which he forbore to check.

XVII.

   Stop! for thy tread is on an empire's dust!
   An earthquake's spoil is sepulchred below!
   Is the spot marked with no colossal bust?
   Nor column trophied for triumphal show?
   None; but the moral's truth tells simpler so,
   As the ground was before, thus let it be; -
   How that red rain hath made the harvest grow!
   And is this all the world has gained by thee,
Thou first and last of fields! king-making Victory?

XVIII.

   And Harold stands upon this place of skulls,
   The grave of France, the deadly Waterloo!
   How in an hour the power which gave annuls
   Its gifts, transferring fame as fleeting too!
   In 'pride of place' here last the eagle flew,
   Then tore with bloody talon the rent plain,
   Pierced by the shaft of banded nations through:
   Ambition's life and labours all were vain;
He wears the shattered links of the world's broken chain.

XIX.

   Fit retribution!  Gaul may champ the bit,
   And foam in fetters, but is Earth more free?
   Did nations combat to make ONE submit;
   Or league to teach all kings true sovereignty?
   What! shall reviving thraldom again be
   The patched-up idol of enlightened days?
   Shall we, who struck the Lion down, shall we
   Pay the Wolf homage? proffering lowly gaze
And servile knees to thrones?  No; PROVE before ye praise!

XX.

   If not, o'er one fall'n despot boast no more!
   In vain fair cheeks were furrowed with hot tears
   For Europe's flowers long rooted up before
   The trampler of her vineyards; in vain years
   Of death, depopulation, bondage, fears,
   Have all been borne, and broken by the accord
   Of roused-up millions:  all that most endears
   Glory, is when the myrtle wreathes a sword
Such as Harmodius drew on Athens' tyrant lord.

XXI.

   There was a sound of revelry by night,
   And Belgium's capital had gathered then
   Her Beauty and her Chivalry, and bright
   The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;
   A thousand hearts beat happily; and when
   Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
   Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,
   And all went merry as a marriage bell;
But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!

XXII.

   Did ye not hear it?--No; 'twas but the wind,
   Or the car rattling o'er the stony street;
   On with the dance! let joy be unconfined;
   No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet
   To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet.
   But hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more,
   As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
   And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!
Arm! arm! it is--it is--the cannon's opening roar!

XXIII.

   Within a windowed niche of that high hall
   Sate Brunswick's fated chieftain; he did hear
   That sound, the first amidst the festival,
   And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;
   And when they smiled because he deemed it near,
   His heart more truly knew that peal too well
   Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,
   And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell:
He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.

XXIV.

   Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,
   And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,
   And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago
   Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness;
   And there were sudden partings, such as press
   The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
   Which ne'er might be repeated:  who would guess
   If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise!

XXV.

   And there was mounting in hot haste:  the steed,
   The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,
   Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
   And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;
   And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;
   And near, the beat of the alarming drum
   Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;
   While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,
Or whispering, with white lips--'The foe!  They come! they come!'

XXVI.

   And wild and high the 'Cameron's gathering' rose,
   The war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn's hills
   Have heard, and heard, too, have her Saxon foes:
   How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills
   Savage and shrill!  But with the breath which fills
   Their mountain-pipe, so fill the mountaineers
   With the fierce native daring which instils
   The stirring memory of a thousand years,
And Evan's, Donald's fame rings in each clansman's ears.

XXVII.

   And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,
   Dewy with Nature's tear-drops, as they pass,
   Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,
   Over the unreturniug brave,--alas!
   Ere evening to be trodden like the grass
   Which now beneath them, but above shall grow
   In its next verdure, when this fiery mass
   Of living valour, rolling on the foe,
And burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low.

XXVIII.

   Last noon beheld them full of lusty life,
   Last eve in Beauty's circle proudly gay,
   The midnight brought the signal-sound of strife,
   The morn the marshalling in arms,--the day
   Battle's magnificently stern array!
   The thunder-clouds close o'er it, which when rent
   The earth is covered thick with other clay,
   Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,
Rider and horse,--friend, foe,--in one red burial blent!

XXIX.

   Their praise is hymned by loftier harps than mine;
   Yet one I would select from that proud throng,
   Partly because they blend me with his line,
   And partly that I did his sire some wrong,
   And partly that bright names will hallow song;
   And his was of the bravest, and when showered
   The death-bolts deadliest the thinned files along,
   Even where the thickest of war's tempest lowered,
They reached no nobler breast than thine, young, gallant Howard!

XXX.

   There have been tears and breaking hearts for thee,
   And mine were nothing, had I such to give;
   But when I stood beneath the fresh green tree,
   Which living waves where thou didst cease to live,
   And saw around me the wild field revive
   With fruits and fertile promise, and the Spring
   Come forth her work of gladness to contrive,
   With all her reckless birds upon the wing,
I turned from all she brought to those she could not bring.

XXXI.

   I turned to thee, to thousands, of whom each
   And one as all a ghastly gap did make
   In his own kind and kindred, whom to teach
   Forgetfulness were mercy for their sake;
   The Archangel's trump, not Glory's, must awake
   Those whom they thirst for; though the sound of Fame
   May for a moment soothe, it cannot slake
   The fever of vain longing, and the name
So honoured, but assumes a stronger, bitterer claim.

XXXII.

   They mourn, but smile at length; and, smiling, mourn:
   The tree will wither long before it fall:
   The hull drives on, though mast and sail be torn;
   The roof-tree sinks, but moulders on the hall
   In massy hoariness; the ruined wall
   Stands when its wind-worn battlements are gone;
   The bars survive the captive they enthral;
   The day drags through though storms keep out the sun;
And thus the heart will break, yet brokenly live on:

XXXIII.

   E'en as a broken mirror, which the glass
   In every fragment multiplies; and makes
   A thousand images of one that was,
   The same, and still the more, the more it breaks;
   And thus the heart will do which not forsakes,
   Living in shattered guise, and still, and cold,
   And bloodless, with its sleepless sorrow aches,
   Yet withers on till all without is old,
Showing no visible sign, for such things are untold.

XXXIV.

   There is a very life in our despair,
   Vitality of poison,--a quick root
   Which feeds these deadly branches; for it were
   As nothing did we die; but life will suit
   Itself to Sorrow's most detested fruit,
   Like to the apples on the Dead Sea shore,
   All ashes to the taste:  Did man compute
   Existence by enjoyment, and count o'er
Such hours 'gainst years of life,--say, would he name threescore?

XXXV.

   The Psalmist numbered out the years of man:
   They are enough:  and if thy tale be TRUE,
   Thou, who didst grudge him e'en that fleeting span,
   More than enough, thou fatal Waterloo!
   Millions of tongues record thee, and anew
   Their children's lips shall echo them, and say,
   'Here, where the sword united nations drew,
   Our countrymen were warring on that day!'
And this is much, and all which will not pass away.

XXXVI.

   There sunk the greatest, nor the worst of men,
   Whose spirit anithetically mixed
   One moment of the mightiest, and again
   On little objects with like firmness fixed;
   Extreme in all things! hadst thou been betwixt,
   Thy throne had still been thine, or never been;
   For daring made thy rise as fall:  thou seek'st
   Even now to reassume the imperial mien,
And shake again the world, the Thunderer of the scene!

XXXVII.

   Conqueror and captive of the earth art thou!
   She trembles at thee still, and thy wild name
   Was ne'er more bruited in men's minds than now
   That thou art nothing, save the jest of Fame,
   Who wooed thee once, thy vassal, and became
   The flatterer of thy fierceness, till thou wert
   A god unto thyself; nor less the same
   To the astounded kingdoms all inert,
Who deemed thee for a time whate'er thou didst assert.

XXXVIII.

   Oh, more or less than man--in high or low,
   Battling with nations, flying from the field;
   Now making monarchs' necks thy footstool, now
   More than thy meanest soldier taught to yield:
   An empire thou couldst crush, command, rebuild,
   But govern not thy pettiest passion, nor,
   However deeply in men's spirits skilled,
   Look through thine own, nor curb the lust of war,
Nor learn that tempted Fate will leave the loftiest star.

XXXIX.

   Yet well thy soul hath brooked the turning tide
   With that untaught innate philosophy,
   Which, be it wisdom, coldness, or deep pride,
   Is gall and wormwood to an enemy.
   When the whole host of hatred stood hard by,
   To watch and mock thee shrinking, thou hast smiled
   With a sedate and all-enduring eye;
   When Fortune fled her spoiled and favourite child,
He stood unbowed beneath the ills upon him piled.

XL.

   Sager than in thy fortunes; for in them
   Ambition steeled thee on to far too show
   That just habitual scorn, which could contemn
   Men and their thoughts; 'twas wise to feel, not so
   To wear it ever on thy lip and brow,
   And spurn the instruments thou wert to use
   Till they were turned unto thine overthrow:
   'Tis but a worthless world to win or lose;
So hath it proved to thee, and all such lot who choose.

XLI.

   If, like a tower upon a headland rock,
   Thou hadst been made to stand or fall alone,
   Such scorn of man had helped to brave the shock;
   But men's thoughts were the steps which paved thy throne,
   THEIR admiration thy best weapon shone;
   The part of Philip's son was thine, not then
   (Unless aside thy purple had been thrown)
   Like stern Diogenes to mock at men;
For sceptred cynics earth were far too wide a den.

XLII.

   But quiet to quick bosoms is a hell,
   And THERE hath been thy bane; there is a fire
   And motion of the soul, which will not dwell
   In its own narrow being, but aspire
   Beyond the fitting medium of desire;
   And, but once kindled, quenchless evermore,
   Preys upon high adventure, nor can tire
   Of aught but rest; a fever at the core,
Fatal to him who bears, to all who ever bore.

XLIII.

   This makes the madmen who have made men mad
   By their contagion!  Conquerors and Kings,
   Founders of sects and systems, to whom add
   Sophists, Bards, Statesmen, all unquiet things
   Which stir too strongly the soul's secret springs,
   And are themselves the fools to those they fool;
   Envied, yet how unenviable! what stings
   Are theirs!  One breast laid open were a school
Which would unteach mankind the lust to shine or rule:

XLIV.

   Their breath is agitation, and their life
   A storm whereon they ride, to sink at last,
   And yet so nursed and bigoted to strife,
   That should their days, surviving perils past,
   Melt to calm twilight, they feel overcast
   With sorrow and supineness, and so die;
   Even as a flame unfed, which runs to waste
   With its own flickering, or a sword laid by,
Which eats into itself, and rusts ingloriously.

XLV.

   He who ascends to mountain-tops, shall find
   The loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow;
   He who surpasses or subdues mankind,
   Must look down on the hate of those below.
   Though high ABOVE the sun of glory glow,
   And far BENEATH the earth and ocean spread,
   ROUND him are icy rocks, and loudly blow
   Contending tempests on his naked head,
And thus reward the toils which to those summits led.

XLVI.

   Away with these; true Wisdom's world will be
   Within its own creation, or in thine,
   Maternal Nature! for who teems like thee,
   Thus on the banks of thy majestic Rhine?
   There Harold gazes on a work divine,
   A blending of all beauties; streams and dells,
   Fruit, foliage, crag, wood, corn-field, mountain, vine,
   And chiefless castles breathing stern farewells
From grey but leafy walls, where Ruin greenly dwells.

XLVII.

   And there they stand, as stands a lofty mind,
   Worn, but unstooping to the baser crowd,
   All tenantless, save to the crannying wind,
   Or holding dark communion with the cloud.
   There was a day when they were young and proud,
   Banners on high, and battles passed below;
   But they who fought are in a bloody shroud,
   And those which waved are shredless dust ere now,
And the bleak battlements shall bear no future blow.

XLVIII.

   Beneath these battlements, within those walls,
   Power dwelt amidst her passions; in proud state
   Each robber chief upheld his armed halls,
   Doing his evil will, nor less elate
   Than mightier heroes of a longer date.
   What want these outlaws conquerors should have
   But History's purchased page to call them great?
   A wider space, an ornamented grave?
Their hopes were not less warm, their souls were full as brave.

XLIX.

   In their baronial feuds and single fields,
   What deeds of prowess unrecorded died!
   And Love, which lent a blazon to their shields,
   With emblems well devised by amorous pride,
   Through all the mail of iron hearts would glide;
   But still their flame was fierceness, and drew on
   Keen contest and destruction near allied,
   And many a tower for some fair mischief won,
Saw the discoloured Rhine beneath its ruin run.

L.

   But thou, exulting and abounding river!
   Making thy waves a blessing as they flow
   Through banks whose beauty would endure for ever,
   Could man but leave thy bright creation so,
   Nor its fair promise from the surface mow
   With the sharp scythe of conflict,--then to see
   Thy valley of sweet waters, were to know
   Earth paved like Heaven; and to seem such to me
Even now what wants thy stream?--that it should Lethe be.

LI.

   A thousand battles have assailed thy banks,
   But these and half their fame have passed away,
   And Slaughter heaped on high his weltering ranks:
   Their very graves are gone, and what are they?
   Thy tide washed down the blood of yesterday,
   And all was stainless, and on thy clear stream
   Glassed with its dancing light the sunny ray;
   But o'er the blackened memory's blighting dream
Thy waves would vainly roll, all sweeping as they seem.

LII.

   Thus Harold inly said, and passed along,
   Yet not insensible to all which here
   Awoke the jocund birds to early song
   In glens which might have made e'en exile dear:
   Though on his brow were graven lines austere,
   And tranquil sternness which had ta'en the place
   Of feelings fierier far but less severe,
   Joy was not always absent from his face,
But o'er it in such scenes would steal with transient trace.

LIII.

   Nor was all love shut from him, though his days
   Of passion had consumed themselves to dust.
   It is in vain that we would coldly gaze
   On such as smile upon us; the heart must
   Leap kindly back to kindness, though disgust
   Hath weaned it from all worldlings:  thus he felt,
   For there was soft remembrance, and sweet trust
   In one fond breast, to which his own would melt,
And in its tenderer hour on that his bosom dwelt.

LIV.

   And he had learned to love,--I know not why,
   For this in such as him seems strange of mood, -
   The helpless looks of blooming infancy,
   Even in its earliest nurture; what subdued,
   To change like this, a mind so far imbued
   With scorn of man, it little boots to know;
   But thus it was; and though in solitude
   Small power the nipped affections have to grow,
In him this glowed when all beside had ceased to glow.

LV.

   And there was one soft breast, as hath been said,
   Which unto his was bound by stronger ties
   Than the church links withal; and, though unwed,
   THAT love was pure, and, far above disguise,
   Had stood the test of mortal enmities
   Still undivided, and cemented more
   By peril, dreaded most in female eyes;
   But this was firm, and from a foreign shore
Well to that heart might his these absent greetings pour!

   The castled crag of Drachenfels
   Frowns o'er the wide and winding Rhine.
   Whose breast of waters broadly swells
   Between the banks which bear the vine,
   And hills all rich with blossomed trees,
   And fields which promise corn and wine,
   And scattered cities crowning these,
   Whose far white walls along them shine,
   Have strewed a scene, which I should see
   With double joy wert THOU with me!

   And peasant girls, with deep blue eyes,
   And hands which offer early flowers,
   Walk smiling o'er this paradise;
   Above, the frequent feudal towers
   Through green leaves lift their walls of grey,
   And many a rock which steeply lours,
   And noble arch in proud decay,
   Look o'er this vale of vintage bowers:
   But one thing want these banks of Rhine, -
   Thy gentle hand to clasp in mine!

   I send the lilies given to me;
   Though long before thy hand they touch,
   I know that they must withered be,
   But yet reject them not as such;
   For I have cherished them as dear,
   Because they yet may meet thine eye,
   And guide thy soul to mine e'en here,
   When thou behold'st them drooping nigh,
   And know'st them gathered by the Rhine,
   And offered from my heart to thine!

   The river nobly foams and flows,
   The charm of this enchanted ground,
   And all its thousand turns disclose
   Some fresher beauty varying round;
   The haughtiest breast its wish might bound
   Through life to dwell delighted here;
   Nor could on earth a spot be found
   To Nature and to me so dear,
   Could thy dear eyes in following mine
   Still sweeten more these banks of Rhine!

LVI.

   By Coblentz, on a rise of gentle ground,
   There is a small and simple pyramid,
   Crowning the summit of the verdant mound;
   Beneath its base are heroes' ashes hid,
   Our enemy's,--but let not that forbid
   Honour to Marceau! o'er whose early tomb
   Tears, big tears, gushed from the rough soldier's lid,
   Lamenting and yet envying such a doom,
Falling for France, whose rights he battled to resume.

LVI.

   Brief, brave, and glorious was his young career, -
   His mourners were two hosts, his friends and foes;
   And fitly may the stranger lingering here
   Pray for his gallant spirit's bright repose;
   For he was Freedom's champion, one of those,
   The few in number, who had not o'erstept
   The charter to chastise which she bestows
   On such as wield her weapons; he had kept
The whiteness of his soul, and thus men o'er him wept.

LVIII.

   Here Ehrenbreitstein, with her shattered wall
   Black with the miner's blast, upon her height
   Yet shows of what she was, when shell and ball
   Rebounding idly on her strength did light;
   A tower of victory! from whence the flight
   Of baffled foes was watched along the plain;
   But Peace destroyed what War could never blight,
   And laid those proud roofs bare to Summer's rain -
On which the iron shower for years had poured in vain.

LIX.

   Adieu to thee, fair Rhine!  How long, delighted,
   The stranger fain would linger on his way;
   Thine is a scene alike where souls united
   Or lonely Contemplation thus might stray;
   And could the ceaseless vultures cease to prey
   On self-condemning bosoms, it were here,
   Where Nature, not too sombre nor too gay,
   Wild but not rude, awful yet not austere,
Is to the mellow earth as autumn to the year.

LX.

   Adieu to thee again! a vain adieu!
   There can be no farewell to scene like thine;
   The mind is coloured by thy every hue;
   And if reluctantly the eyes resign
   Their cherished gaze upon thee, lovely Rhine!
   'Tis with the thankful glance of parting praise;
   More mighty spots may rise--more glaring shine,
   But none unite in one attaching maze
The brilliant, fair, and soft;--the glories of old days.

LXI.

   The negligently grand, the fruitful bloom
   Of coming ripeness, the white city's sheen,
   The rolling stream, the precipice's gloom,
   The forest's growth, and Gothic walls between,
   The wild rocks shaped as they had turrets been
   In mockery of man's art; and these withal
   A race of faces happy as the scene,
   Whose fertile bounties here extend to all,
Still springing o'er thy banks, though empires near them fall.

LXII.

   But these recede.  Above me are the Alps,
   The palaces of Nature, whose vast walls
   Have pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps,
   And throned Eternity in icy halls
   Of cold sublimity, where forms and falls
   The avalanche--the thunderbolt of snow!
   All that expands the spirit, yet appals,
   Gathers around these summits, as to show
How Earth may pierce to Heaven, yet leave vain man below.

LXIII.

   But ere these matchless heights I dare to scan,
   There is a spot should not be passed in vain, -
   Morat! the proud, the patriot field! where man
   May gaze on ghastly trophies of the slain,
   Nor blush for those who conquered on that plain;
   Here Burgundy bequeathed his tombless host,
   A bony heap, through ages to remain,
   Themselves their monument;--the Stygian coast
Unsepulchred they roamed, and shrieked each wandering ghost.

LXIV.

   While Waterloo with Cannae's carnage vies,
   Morat and Marathon twin names shall stand;
   They were true Glory's stainless victories,
   Won by the unambitious heart and hand
   Of a proud, brotherly, and civic band,
   All unbought champions in no princely cause
   Of vice-entailed Corruption; they no land
   Doomed to bewail the blasphemy of laws
Making king's rights divine, by some Draconic clause.

LXV.

   By a lone wall a lonelier column rears
   A grey and grief-worn aspect of old days
   'Tis the last remnant of the wreck of years,
   And looks as with the wild bewildered gaze
   Of one to stone converted by amaze,
   Yet still with consciousness; and there it stands,
   Making a marvel that it not decays,
   When the coeval pride of human hands,
Levelled Aventicum, hath strewed her subject lands.

LXVI.

   And there--oh! sweet and sacred be the name! -
   Julia--the daughter, the devoted--gave
   Her youth to Heaven; her heart, beneath a claim
   Nearest to Heaven's, broke o'er a father's grave.
   Justice is sworn 'gainst tears, and hers would crave
   The life she lived in; but the judge was just,
   And then she died on him she could not save.
   Their tomb was simple, and without a bust,
And held within their urn one mind, one heart, one dust.

LXVII.

   But these are deeds which should not pass away,
   And names that must not wither, though the earth
   Forgets her empires with a just decay,
   The enslavers and the enslaved, their death and birth;
   The high, the mountain-majesty of worth,
   Should be, and shall, survivor of its woe,
   And from its immortality look forth
   In the sun's face, like yonder Alpine snow,
Imperishably pure beyond all things below.

LXVIII.

   Lake Leman woos me with its crystal face,
   The mirror where the stars and mountains view
   The stillness of their aspect in each trace
   Its clear depth yields of their far height and hue:
   There is too much of man here, to look through
   With a fit mind the might which I behold;
   But soon in me shall Loneliness renew
   Thoughts hid, but not less cherished than of old,
Ere mingling with the herd had penned me in their fold.

LXIX.

   To fly from, need not be to hate, mankind;
   All are not fit with them to stir and toil,
   Nor is it discontent to keep the mind
   Deep in its fountain, lest it overboil
   In one hot throng, where we become the spoil
   Of our infection, till too late and long
   We may deplore and struggle with the coil,
   In wretched interchange of wrong for wrong
Midst a contentious world, striving where none are strong.

LXX.

   There, in a moment, we may plunge our years
   In fatal penitence, and in the blight
   Of our own soul, turn all our blood to tears,
   And colour things to come with hues of Night;
   The race of life becomes a hopeless flight
   To those that walk in darkness:  on the sea,
   The boldest steer but where their ports invite,
   But there are wanderers o'er Eternity
Whose bark drives on and on, and anchored ne'er shall be.

LXXI.

   Is it not better, then, to be alone,
   And love Earth only for its earthly sake?
   By the blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone,
   Or the pure bosom of its nursing lake,
   Which feeds it as a mother who doth make
   A fair but froward infant her own care,
   Kissing its cries away as these awake; -
   Is it not better thus our lives to wear,
Than join the crushing crowd, doomed to inflict or bear?

LXXII.

   I live not in myself, but I become
   Portion of that around me; and to me,
   High mountains are a feeling, but the hum
   Of human cities torture:  I can see
   Nothing to loathe in Nature, save to be
   A link reluctant in a fleshly chain,
   Classed among creatures, when the soul can flee,
   And with the sky, the peak, the heaving plain
Of ocean, or the stars, mingle, and not in vain.

LXXIII.

   And thus I am absorbed, and this is life:
   I look upon the peopled desert Past,
   As on a place of agony and strife,
   Where, for some sin, to Sorrow I was cast,
   To act and suffer, but remount at last
   With a fresh pinion; which I felt to spring,
   Though young, yet waxing vigorous as the blast
   Which it would cope with, on delighted wing,
Spurning the clay-cold bonds which round our being cling.

LXXIV.

   And when, at length, the mind shall be all free
   From what it hates in this degraded form,
   Reft of its carnal life, save what shall be
   Existent happier in the fly and worm, -
   When elements to elements conform,
   And dust is as it should be, shall I not
   Feel all I see, less dazzling, but more warm?
   The bodiless thought? the Spirit of each spot?
Of which, even now, I share at times the immortal lot?

LXXV.

   Are not the mountains, waves, and skies a part
   Of me and of my soul, as I of them?
   Is not the love of these deep in my heart
   With a pure passion? should I not contemn
   All objects, if compared with these? and stem
   A tide of suffering, rather than forego
   Such feelings for the hard and worldly phlegm
   Of those whose eyes are only turned below,
Gazing upon the ground, with thoughts which dare not glow?

LXXVI.

   But this is not my theme; and I return
   To that which is immediate, and require
   Those who find contemplation in the urn,
   To look on One whose dust was once all fire,
   A native of the land where I respire
   The clear air for awhile--a passing guest,
   Where he became a being,--whose desire
   Was to be glorious; 'twas a foolish quest,
The which to gain and keep he sacrificed all rest.

LXXVII.

   Here the self-torturing sophist, wild Rousseau,
   The apostle of affliction, he who threw
   Enchantment over passion, and from woe
   Wrung overwhelming eloquence, first drew
   The breath which made him wretched; yet he knew
   How to make madness beautiful, and cast
   O'er erring deeds and thoughts a heavenly hue
   Of words, like sunbeams, dazzling as they past
The eyes, which o'er them shed tears feelingly and fast.

LXXVIII.

   His love was passion's essence--as a tree
   On fire by lightning; with ethereal flame
   Kindled he was, and blasted; for to be
   Thus, and enamoured, were in him the same.
   But his was not the love of living dame,
   Nor of the dead who rise upon our dreams,
   But of Ideal beauty, which became
   In him existence, and o'erflowing teems
Along his burning page, distempered though it seems.

LXXIX.

   THIS breathed itself to life in Julie, THIS
   Invested her with all that's wild and sweet;
   This hallowed, too, the memorable kiss
   Which every morn his fevered lip would greet,
   From hers, who but with friendship his would meet:
   But to that gentle touch, through brain and breast
   Flashed the thrilled spirit's love-devouring heat;
   In that absorbing sigh perchance more blest,
Than vulgar minds may be with all they seek possest.

LXXX.

   His life was one long war with self-sought foes,
   Or friends by him self-banished; for his mind
   Had grown Suspicion's sanctuary, and chose
   For its own cruel sacrifice, the kind,
   'Gainst whom he raged with fury strange and blind.
   But he was frenzied,--wherefore, who may know?
   Since cause might be which skill could never find;
   But he was frenzied by disease or woe
To that worst pitch of all, which wears a reasoning show.

LXXXI.

   For then he was inspired, and from him came,
   As from the Pythian's mystic cave of yore,
   Those oracles which set the world in flame,
   Nor ceased to burn till kingdoms were no more:
   Did he not this for France, which lay before
   Bowed to the inborn tyranny of years?
   Broken and trembling to the yoke she bore,
   Till by the voice of him and his compeers
Roused up to too much wrath, which follows o'ergrown fears?

LXXXII.

   They made themselves a fearful monument!
   The wreck of old opinions--things which grew,
   Breathed from the birth of time:  the veil they rent,
   And what behind it lay, all earth shall view.
   But good with ill they also overthrew,
   Leaving but ruins, wherewith to rebuild
   Upon the same foundation, and renew
   Dungeons and thrones, which the same hour refilled,
As heretofore, because ambition was self-willed.

LXXXIII.

   But this will not endure, nor be endured!
   Mankind have felt their strength, and made it felt.
   They might have used it better, but, allured
   By their new vigour, sternly have they dealt
   On one another; Pity ceased to melt
   With her once natural charities.  But they,
   Who in Oppression's darkness caved had dwelt,
   They were not eagles, nourished with the day;
What marvel then, at times, if they mistook their prey?

LXXXIV.

   What deep wounds ever closed without a scar?
   The heart's bleed longest, and but heal to wear
   That which disfigures it; and they who war
   With their own hopes, and have been vanquished, bear
   Silence, but not submission:  in his lair
   Fixed Passion holds his breath, until the hour
   Which shall atone for years; none need despair:
   It came, it cometh, and will come,--the power
To punish or forgive--in ONE we shall be slower.

LXXXV.

   Clear, placid Leman! thy contrasted lake,
   With the wild world I dwelt in, is a thing
   Which warns me, with its stillness, to forsake
   Earth's troubled waters for a purer spring.
   This quiet sail is as a noiseless wing
   To waft me from distraction; once I loved
   Torn ocean's roar, but thy soft murmuring
   Sounds sweet as if a sister's voice reproved,
That I with stern delights should e'er have been so moved.

LXXXVI.

   It is the hush of night, and all between
   Thy margin and the mountains, dusk, yet clear,
   Mellowed and mingling, yet distinctly seen.
   Save darkened Jura, whose capt heights appear
   Precipitously steep; and drawing near,
   There breathes a living fragrance from the shore,
   Of flowers yet fresh with childhood; on the ear
   Drops the light drip of the suspended oar,
Or chirps the grasshopper one good-night carol more;

LXXXVII.

   He is an evening reveller, who makes
   His life an infancy, and sings his fill;
   At intervals, some bird from out the brakes
   Starts into voice a moment, then is still.
   There seems a floating whisper on the hill,
   But that is fancy, for the starlight dews
   All silently their tears of love instil,
   Weeping themselves away, till they infuse
Deep into Nature's breast the spirit of her hues.

LXXXVIII.

   Ye stars! which are the poetry of heaven,
   If in your bright leaves we would read the fate
   Of men and empires,--'tis to be forgiven,
   That in our aspirations to be great,
   Our destinies o'erleap their mortal state,
   And claim a kindred with you; for ye are
   A beauty and a mystery, and create
   In us such love and reverence from afar,
That fortune, fame, power, life, have named themselves a star.

LXXXIX.

   All heaven and earth are still--though not in sleep,
   But breathless, as we grow when feeling most;
   And silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep:  -
   All heaven and earth are still:  from the high host
   Of stars, to the lulled lake and mountain-coast,
   All is concentered in a life intense,
   Where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,
   But hath a part of being, and a sense
Of that which is of all Creator and defence.

XC.

   Then stirs the feeling infinite, so felt
   In solitude, where we are LEAST alone;
   A truth, which through our being then doth melt,
   And purifies from self:  it is a tone,
   The soul and source of music, which makes known
   Eternal harmony, and sheds a charm,
   Like to the fabled Cytherea's zone,
   Binding all things with beauty;--'twould disarm
The spectre Death, had he substantial power to harm.

XCI.

   Nor vainly did the early Persian make
   His altar the high places and the peak
   Of earth-o'ergazing mountains, and thus take
   A fit and unwalled temple, there to seek
   The Spirit, in whose honour shrines are weak,
   Upreared of human hands.  Come, and compare
   Columns and idol-dwellings, Goth or Greek,
   With Nature's realms of worship, earth and air,
Nor fix on fond abodes to circumscribe thy prayer!

XCII.

   The sky is changed!--and such a change!  O night,
   And storm, and darkness, ye are wondrous strong,
   Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light
   Of a dark eye in woman!  Far along,
   From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,
   Leaps the live thunder!  Not from one lone cloud,
   But every mountain now hath found a tongue;
   And Jura answers, through her misty shroud,
Back to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud!

XCIII.

   And this is in the night: --Most glorious night!
   Thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be
   A sharer in thy fierce and far delight -
   A portion of the tempest and of thee!
   How the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,
   And the big rain comes dancing to the earth!
   And now again 'tis black,--and now, the glee
   Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain-mirth,
As if they did rejoice o'er a young earthquake's birth.

XCIV.

   Now, where the swift Rhone cleaves his way between
   Heights which appear as lovers who have parted
   In hate, whose mining depths so intervene,
   That they can meet no more, though broken-hearted;
   Though in their souls, which thus each other thwarted,
   Love was the very root of the fond rage
   Which blighted their life's bloom, and then departed:
   Itself expired, but leaving them an age
Of years all winters--war within themselves to wage.

XCV.

   Now, where the quick Rhone thus hath cleft his way,
   The mightiest of the storms hath ta'en his stand;
   For here, not one, but many, make their play,
   And fling their thunderbolts from hand to hand,
   Flashing and cast around:  of all the band,
   The brightest through these parted hills hath forked
   His lightnings, as if he did understand
   That in such gaps as desolation worked,
There the hot shaft should blast whatever therein lurked.

XCVI.

   Sky, mountains, river, winds, lake, lightnings! ye,
   With night, and clouds, and thunder, and a soul
   To make these felt and feeling, well may be
   Things that have made me watchful; the far roll
   Of your departing voices, is the knoll
   Of what in me is sleepless,--if I rest.
   But where of ye, O tempests! is the goal?
   Are ye like those within the human breast?
Or do ye find at length, like eagles, some high nest?

XCVII.

   Could I embody and unbosom now
   That which is most within me,--could I wreak
   My thoughts upon expression, and thus throw
   Soul, heart, mind, passions, feelings, strong or weak,
   All that I would have sought, and all I seek,
   Bear, know, feel, and yet breathe--into one word,
   And that one word were lightning, I would speak;
   But as it is, I live and die unheard,
With a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword.

XCVIII.

   The morn is up again, the dewy morn,
   With breath all incense, and with cheek all bloom,
   Laughing the clouds away with playful scorn,
   And living as if earth contained no tomb, -
   And glowing into day:  we may resume
   The march of our existence:  and thus I,
   Still on thy shores, fair Leman! may find room
   And food for meditation, nor pass by
Much, that may give us pause, if pondered fittingly.

XCIX.

   Clarens! sweet Clarens! birthplace of deep Love!
   Thine air is the young breath of passionate thought;
   Thy trees take root in love; the snows above
   The very glaciers have his colours caught,
   And sunset into rose-hues sees them wrought
   By rays which sleep there lovingly:  the rocks,
   The permanent crags, tell here of Love, who sought
   In them a refuge from the worldly shocks,
Which stir and sting the soul with hope that woos, then mocks.

C.

   Clarens! by heavenly feet thy paths are trod, -
   Undying Love's, who here ascends a throne
   To which the steps are mountains; where the god
   Is a pervading life and light,--so shown
   Not on those summits solely, nor alone
   In the still cave and forest; o'er the flower
   His eye is sparkling, and his breath hath blown,
   His soft and summer breath, whose tender power
Passes the strength of storms in their most desolate hour.

CI.

   All things are here of HIM; from the black pines,
   Which are his shade on high, and the loud roar
   Of torrents, where he listeneth, to the vines
   Which slope his green path downward to the shore,
   Where the bowed waters meet him, and adore,
   Kissing his feet with murmurs; and the wood,
   The covert of old trees, with trunks all hoar,
   But light leaves, young as joy, stands where it stood,
Offering to him, and his, a populous solitude.

CII.

   A populous solitude of bees and birds,
   And fairy-formed and many coloured things,
   Who worship him with notes more sweet than words,
   And innocently open their glad wings,
   Fearless and full of life:  the gush of springs,
   And fall of lofty fountains, and the bend
   Of stirring branches, and the bud which brings
   The swiftest thought of beauty, here extend,
Mingling, and made by Love, unto one mighty end.

CIII.

   He who hath loved not, here would learn that lore,
   And make his heart a spirit:  he who knows
   That tender mystery, will love the more,
   For this is Love's recess, where vain men's woes,
   And the world's waste, have driven him far from those,
   For 'tis his nature to advance or die;
   He stands not still, but or decays, or grows
   Into a boundless blessing, which may vie
With the immortal lights, in its eternity!

CIV.

   'Twas not for fiction chose Rousseau this spot,
   Peopling it with affections; but he found
   It was the scene which passion must allot
   To the mind's purified beings; 'twas the ground
   Where early Love his Psyche's zone unbound,
   And hallowed it with loveliness:  'tis lone,
   And wonderful, and deep, and hath a sound,
   And sense, and sight of sweetness; here the Rhone
Hath spread himself a couch, the Alps have reared a throne.

CV.

   Lausanne! and Ferney! ye have been the abodes
   Of names which unto you bequeathed a name;
   Mortals, who sought and found, by dangerous roads,
   A path to perpetuity of fame:
   They were gigantic minds, and their steep aim
   Was, Titan-like, on daring doubts to pile
   Thoughts which should call down thunder, and the flame
   Of Heaven, again assailed, if Heaven the while
On man and man's research could deign do more than smile.

CVI.

   The one was fire and fickleness, a child
   Most mutable in wishes, but in mind
   A wit as various,--gay, grave, sage, or wild, -
   Historian, bard, philosopher combined:
   He multiplied himself among mankind,
   The Proteus of their talents:  But his own
   Breathed most in ridicule,--which, as the wind,
   Blew where it listed, laying all things prone, -
Now to o'erthrow a fool, and now to shake a throne.

CVII.

   The other, deep and slow, exhausting thought,
   And hiving wisdom with each studious year,
   In meditation dwelt, with learning wrought,
   And shaped his weapon with an edge severe,
   Sapping a solemn creed with solemn sneer;
   The lord of irony,--that master spell,
   Which stung his foes to wrath, which grew from fear,
   And doomed him to the zealot's ready hell,
Which answers to all doubts so eloquently well.

CVIII.

   Yet, peace be with their ashes,--for by them,
   If merited, the penalty is paid;
   It is not ours to judge, far less condemn;
   The hour must come when such things shall be made
   Known unto all,--or hope and dread allayed
   By slumber on one pillow, in the dust,
   Which, thus much we are sure, must lie decayed;
   And when it shall revive, as is our trust,
'Twill be to be forgiven, or suffer what is just.

CIX.

   But let me quit man's works, again to read
   His Maker's spread around me, and suspend
   This page, which from my reveries I feed,
   Until it seems prolonging without end.
   The clouds above me to the white Alps tend,
   And I must pierce them, and survey whate'er
   May be permitted, as my steps I bend
   To their most great and growing region, where
The earth to her embrace compels the powers of air.

CX.

   Italia! too, Italia! looking on thee
   Full flashes on the soul the light of ages,
   Since the fierce Carthaginian almost won thee,
   To the last halo of the chiefs and sages
   Who glorify thy consecrated pages;
   Thou wert the throne and grave of empires; still,
   The fount at which the panting mind assuages
   Her thirst of knowledge, quaffing there her fill,
Flows from the eternal source of Rome's imperial hill.

CXI.

   Thus far have I proceeded in a theme
   Renewed with no kind auspices: --to feel
   We are not what we have been, and to deem
   We are not what we should be, and to steel
   The heart against itself; and to conceal,
   With a proud caution, love or hate, or aught, -
   Passion or feeling, purpose, grief, or zeal, -
   Which is the tyrant spirit of our thought,
Is a stern task of soul: --No matter,--it is taught.

CXII.

   And for these words, thus woven into song,
   It may be that they are a harmless wile, -
   The colouring of the scenes which fleet along,
   Which I would seize, in passing, to beguile
   My breast, or that of others, for a while.
   Fame is the thirst of youth,--but I am not
   So young as to regard men's frown or smile
   As loss or guerdon of a glorious lot;
I stood and stand alone,--remembered or forgot.

CXIII.

   I have not loved the world, nor the world me;
   I have not flattered its rank breath, nor bowed
   To its idolatries a patient knee, -
   Nor coined my cheek to smiles, nor cried aloud
   In worship of an echo; in the crowd
   They could not deem me one of such; I stood
   Among them, but not of them; in a shroud
   Of thoughts which were not their thoughts, and still could,
Had I not filed my mind, which thus itself subdued.

CXIV.

   I have not loved the world, nor the world me, -
   But let us part fair foes; I do believe,
   Though I have found them not, that there may be
   Words which are things,--hopes which will not deceive,
   And virtues which are merciful, nor weave
   Snares for the falling:  I would also deem
   O'er others' griefs that some sincerely grieve;
   That two, or one, are almost what they seem, -
That goodness is no name, and happiness no dream.

CXV.

   My daughter! with thy name this song begun -
   My daughter! with thy name this much shall end -
   I see thee not, I hear thee not,--but none
   Can be so wrapt in thee; thou art the friend
   To whom the shadows of far years extend:
   Albeit my brow thou never shouldst behold,
   My voice shall with thy future visions blend,
   And reach into thy heart, when mine is cold, -
A token and a tone, even from thy father's mould.

CXVI.

   To aid thy mind's development,--to watch
   Thy dawn of little joys,--to sit and see
   Almost thy very growth,--to view thee catch
   Knowledge of objects, wonders yet to thee!
   To hold thee lightly on a gentle knee,
   And print on thy soft cheek a parent's kiss, -
   This, it should seem, was not reserved for me
   Yet this was in my nature: --As it is,
I know not what is there, yet something like to this.

CXVII.

   Yet, though dull Hate as duty should be taught,
   I know that thou wilt love me; though my name
   Should be shut from thee, as a spell still fraught
   With desolation, and a broken claim:
   Though the grave closed between us,--'twere the same,
   I know that thou wilt love me:  though to drain
   MY blood from out thy being were an aim,
   And an attainment,--all would be in vain, -
Still thou wouldst love me, still that more than life retain.

CXVIII.

   The child of love,--though born in bitterness,
   And nurtured in convulsion.  Of thy sire
   These were the elements, and thine no less.
   As yet such are around thee; but thy fire
   Shall be more tempered, and thy hope far higher.
   Sweet be thy cradled slumbers!  O'er the sea,
   And from the mountains where I now respire,
   Fain would I waft such blessing upon thee,
As, with a sigh, I deem thou mightst have been to me!



CANTO THE FOURTH.



I.

   I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs;
   A palace and a prison on each hand:
   I saw from out the wave her structures rise
   As from the stroke of the enchanter's wand:
   A thousand years their cloudy wings expand
   Around me, and a dying glory smiles
   O'er the far times when many a subject land
   Looked to the winged Lion's marble piles,
Where Venice sate in state, throned on her hundred isles!

II.

   She looks a sea Cybele, fresh from ocean,
   Rising with her tiara of proud towers
   At airy distance, with majestic motion,
   A ruler of the waters and their powers:
   And such she was; her daughters had their dowers
   From spoils of nations, and the exhaustless East
   Poured in her lap all gems in sparkling showers.
   In purple was she robed, and of her feast
Monarchs partook, and deemed their dignity increased.

III.

   In Venice, Tasso's echoes are no more,
   And silent rows the songless gondolier;
   Her palaces are crumbling to the shore,
   And music meets not always now the ear:
   Those days are gone--but beauty still is here.
   States fall, arts fade--but Nature doth not die,
   Nor yet forget how Venice once was dear,
   The pleasant place of all festivity,
The revel of the earth, the masque of Italy!

IV.

   But unto us she hath a spell beyond
   Her name in story, and her long array
   Of mighty shadows, whose dim forms despond
   Above the dogeless city's vanished sway;
   Ours is a trophy which will not decay
   With the Rialto; Shylock and the Moor,
   And Pierre, cannot be swept or worn away -
   The keystones of the arch! though all were o'er,
For us repeopled were the solitary shore.

V.

   The beings of the mind are not of clay;
   Essentially immortal, they create
   And multiply in us a brighter ray
   And more beloved existence:  that which Fate
   Prohibits to dull life, in this our state
   Of mortal bondage, by these spirits supplied,
   First exiles, then replaces what we hate;
   Watering the heart whose early flowers have died,
And with a fresher growth replenishing the void.

VI.

   Such is the refuge of our youth and age,
   The first from Hope, the last from Vacancy;
   And this worn feeling peoples many a page,
   And, may be, that which grows beneath mine eye:
   Yet there are things whose strong reality
   Outshines our fairy-land; in shape and hues
   More beautiful than our fantastic sky,
   And the strange constellations which the Muse
O'er her wild universe is skilful to diffuse:

VII.

   I saw or dreamed of such,--but let them go -
   They came like truth, and disappeared like dreams;
   And whatsoe'er they were--are now but so;
   I could replace them if I would:  still teems
   My mind with many a form which aptly seems
   Such as I sought for, and at moments found;
   Let these too go--for waking reason deems
   Such overweening phantasies unsound,
And other voices speak, and other sights surround.

VIII.

   I've taught me other tongues, and in strange eyes
   Have made me not a stranger; to the mind
   Which is itself, no changes bring surprise;
   Nor is it harsh to make, nor hard to find
   A country with--ay, or without mankind;
   Yet was I born where men are proud to be,
   Not without cause; and should I leave behind
   The inviolate island of the sage and free,
And seek me out a home by a remoter sea,

IX.

   Perhaps I loved it well:  and should I lay
   My ashes in a soil which is not mine,
   My spirit shall resume it--if we may
   Unbodied choose a sanctuary.  I twine
   My hopes of being remembered in my line
   With my land's language:  if too fond and far
   These aspirations in their scope incline, -
   If my fame should be, as my fortunes are,
Of hasty growth and blight, and dull Oblivion bar.

X.

   My name from out the temple where the dead
   Are honoured by the nations--let it be -
   And light the laurels on a loftier head!
   And be the Spartan's epitaph on me -
   'Sparta hath many a worthier son than he.'
   Meantime I seek no sympathies, nor need;
   The thorns which I have reaped are of the tree
   I planted,--they have torn me, and I bleed:
I should have known what fruit would spring from such a seed.

XI.

   The spouseless Adriatic mourns her lord;
   And, annual marriage now no more renewed,
   The Bucentaur lies rotting unrestored,
   Neglected garment of her widowhood!
   St. Mark yet sees his lion where he stood
   Stand, but in mockery of his withered power,
   Over the proud place where an Emperor sued,
   And monarchs gazed and envied in the hour
When Venice was a queen with an unequalled dower.

XII.

   The Suabian sued, and now the Austrian reigns -
   An Emperor tramples where an Emperor knelt;
   Kingdoms are shrunk to provinces, and chains
   Clank over sceptred cities; nations melt
   From power's high pinnacle, when they have felt
   The sunshine for a while, and downward go
   Like lauwine loosened from the mountain's belt:
   Oh for one hour of blind old Dandolo!
The octogenarian chief, Byzantium's conquering foe.

XIII.

   Before St. Mark still glow his steeds of brass,
   Their gilded collars glittering in the sun;
   But is not Doria's menace come to pass?
   Are they not BRIDLED?--Venice, lost and won,
   Her thirteen hundred years of freedom done,
   Sinks, like a seaweed, into whence she rose!
   Better be whelmed beneath the waves, and shun,
   Even in Destruction's depth, her foreign foes,
From whom submission wrings an infamous repose.

XIV.

   In youth she was all glory,--a new Tyre, -
   Her very byword sprung from victory,
   The 'Planter of the Lion,' which through fire
   And blood she bore o'er subject earth and sea;
   Though making many slaves, herself still free
   And Europe's bulwark 'gainst the Ottomite:
   Witness Troy's rival, Candia!  Vouch it, ye
   Immortal waves that saw Lepanto's fight!
For ye are names no time nor tyranny can blight.

XV.

   Statues of glass--all shivered--the long file
   Of her dead doges are declined to dust;
   But where they dwelt, the vast and sumptuous pile
   Bespeaks the pageant of their splendid trust;
   Their sceptre broken, and their sword in rust,
   Have yielded to the stranger:  empty halls,
   Thin streets, and foreign aspects, such as must
   Too oft remind her who and what enthrals,
Have flung a desolate cloud o'er Venice' lovely walls.

XVI.

   When Athens' armies fell at Syracuse,
   And fettered thousands bore the yoke of war,
   Redemption rose up in the Attic Muse,
   Her voice their only ransom from afar:
   See! as they chant the tragic hymn, the car
   Of the o'ermastered victor stops, the reins
   Fall from his hands--his idle scimitar
   Starts from its belt--he rends his captive's chains,
And bids him thank the bard for freedom and his strains.

XVII.

   Thus, Venice, if no stronger claim were thine,
   Were all thy proud historic deeds forgot,
   Thy choral memory of the bard divine,
   Thy love of Tasso, should have cut the knot
   Which ties thee to thy tyrants; and thy lot
   Is shameful to the nations,--most of all,
   Albion! to thee:  the Ocean Queen should not
   Abandon Ocean's children; in the fall
Of Venice think of thine, despite thy watery wall.

XVIII.

   I loved her from my boyhood:  she to me
   Was as a fairy city of the heart,
   Rising like water-columns from the sea,
   Of joy the sojourn, and of wealth the mart
   And Otway, Radcliffe, Schiller, Shakspeare's art,
   Had stamped her image in me, and e'en so,
   Although I found her thus, we did not part,
   Perchance e'en dearer in her day of woe,
Than when she was a boast, a marvel, and a show.

XIX.

   I can repeople with the past--and of
   The present there is still for eye and thought,
   And meditation chastened down, enough;
   And more, it may be, than I hoped or sought;
   And of the happiest moments which were wrought
   Within the web of my existence, some
   From thee, fair Venice! have their colours caught:
   There are some feelings Time cannot benumb,
Nor torture shake, or mine would now be cold and dumb.

XX.

   But from their nature will the tannen grow
   Loftiest on loftiest and least sheltered rocks,
   Rooted in barrenness, where nought below
   Of soil supports them 'gainst the Alpine shocks
   Of eddying storms; yet springs the trunk, and mocks
   The howling tempest, till its height and frame
   Are worthy of the mountains from whose blocks
   Of bleak, grey granite, into life it came,
And grew a giant tree;--the mind may grow the same.

XXI.

   Existence may be borne, and the deep root
   Of life and sufferance make its firm abode
   In bare and desolate bosoms:  mute
   The camel labours with the heaviest load,
   And the wolf dies in silence.  Not bestowed
   In vain should such examples be; if they,
   Things of ignoble or of savage mood,
   Endure and shrink not, we of nobler clay
May temper it to bear,--it is but for a day.

XXII.

   All suffering doth destroy, or is destroyed,
   Even by the sufferer; and, in each event,
   Ends: --Some, with hope replenished and rebuoyed,
   Return to whence they came--with like intent,
   And weave their web again; some, bowed and bent,
   Wax grey and ghastly, withering ere their time,
   And perish with the reed on which they leant;
   Some seek devotion, toil, war, good or crime,
According as their souls were formed to sink or climb.

XXIII.

   But ever and anon of griefs subdued
   There comes a token like a scorpion's sting,
   Scarce seen, but with fresh bitterness imbued;
   And slight withal may be the things which bring
   Back on the heart the weight which it would fling
   Aside for ever:  it may be a sound -
   A tone of music--summer's eve--or spring -
   A flower--the wind--the ocean--which shall wound,
Striking the electric chain wherewith we are darkly bound.

XXIV.

   And how and why we know not, nor can trace
   Home to its cloud this lightning of the mind,
   But feel the shock renewed, nor can efface
   The blight and blackening which it leaves behind,
   Which out of things familiar, undesigned,
   When least we deem of such, calls up to view
   The spectres whom no exorcism can bind, -
   The cold--the changed--perchance the dead--anew,
The mourned, the loved, the lost--too many!--yet how few!

XXV.

   But my soul wanders; I demand it back
   To meditate amongst decay, and stand
   A ruin amidst ruins; there to track
   Fall'n states and buried greatness, o'er a land
   Which WAS the mightiest in its old command,
   And IS the loveliest, and must ever be
   The master-mould of Nature's heavenly hand,
   Wherein were cast the heroic and the free,
The beautiful, the brave--the lords of earth and sea.

XXVI.

   The commonwealth of kings, the men of Rome!
   And even since, and now, fair Italy!
   Thou art the garden of the world, the home
   Of all Art yields, and Nature can decree;
   Even in thy desert, what is like to thee?
   Thy very weeds are beautiful, thy waste
   More rich than other climes' fertility;
   Thy wreck a glory, and thy ruin graced
With an immaculate charm which cannot be defaced.

XXVII.

   The moon is up, and yet it is not night -
   Sunset divides the sky with her--a sea
   Of glory streams along the Alpine height
   Of blue Friuli's mountains; Heaven is free
   From clouds, but of all colours seems to be -
   Melted to one vast Iris of the West,
   Where the day joins the past eternity;
   While, on the other hand, meek Dian's crest
Floats through the azure air--an island of the blest!

XXVIII.

   A single star is at her side, and reigns
   With her o'er half the lovely heaven; but still
   Yon sunny sea heaves brightly, and remains
   Rolled o'er the peak of the far Rhaetian hill,
   As Day and Night contending were, until
   Nature reclaimed her order: --gently flows
   The deep-dyed Brenta, where their hues instil
   The odorous purple of a new-born rose,
Which streams upon her stream, and glassed within it glows,

XXIX.

   Filled with the face of heaven, which, from afar,
   Comes down upon the waters; all its hues,
   From the rich sunset to the rising star,
   Their magical variety diffuse:
   And now they change; a paler shadow strews
   Its mantle o'er the mountains; parting day
   Dies like the dolphin, whom each pang imbues
   With a new colour as it gasps away,
The last still loveliest, till--'tis gone--and all is grey.

XXX.

   There is a tomb in Arqua;--reared in air,
   Pillared in their sarcophagus, repose
   The bones of Laura's lover:  here repair
   Many familiar with his well-sung woes,
   The pilgrims of his genius.  He arose
   To raise a language, and his land reclaim
   From the dull yoke of her barbaric foes:
   Watering the tree which bears his lady's name
With his melodious tears, he gave himself to fame.

XXXI.

   They keep his dust in Arqua, where he died;
   The mountain-village where his latter days
   Went down the vale of years; and 'tis their pride -
   An honest pride--and let it be their praise,
   To offer to the passing stranger's gaze
   His mansion and his sepulchre; both plain
   And venerably simple, such as raise
   A feeling more accordant with his strain,
Than if a pyramid formed his monumental fane.

XXXII.

   And the soft quiet hamlet where he dwelt
   Is one of that complexion which seems made
   For those who their mortality have felt,
   And sought a refuge from their hopes decayed
   In the deep umbrage of a green hill's shade,
   Which shows a distant prospect far away
   Of busy cities, now in vain displayed,
   For they can lure no further; and the ray
Of a bright sun can make sufficient holiday.

XXXIII.

   Developing the mountains, leaves, and flowers
   And shining in the brawling brook, where-by,
   Clear as its current, glide the sauntering hours
   With a calm languor, which, though to the eye
   Idlesse it seem, hath its morality,
   If from society we learn to live,
   'Tis solitude should teach us how to die;
   It hath no flatterers; vanity can give
No hollow aid; alone--man with his God must strive:

XXXIV.

   Or, it may be, with demons, who impair
   The strength of better thoughts, and seek their prey
   In melancholy bosoms, such as were
   Of moody texture from their earliest day,
   And loved to dwell in darkness and dismay,
   Deeming themselves predestined to a doom
   Which is not of the pangs that pass away;
   Making the sun like blood, the earth a tomb,
The tomb a hell, and hell itself a murkier gloom.

XXXV.

   Ferrara! in thy wide and grass-grown streets,
   Whose symmetry was not for solitude,
   There seems as 'twere a curse upon the seat's
   Of former sovereigns, and the antique brood
   Of Este, which for many an age made good
   Its strength within thy walls, and was of yore
   Patron or tyrant, as the changing mood
   Of petty power impelled, of those who wore
The wreath which Dante's brow alone had worn before.

XXXVI.

   And Tasso is their glory and their shame.
   Hark to his strain! and then survey his cell!
   And see how dearly earned Torquato's fame,
   And where Alfonso bade his poet dwell.
   The miserable despot could not quell
   The insulted mind he sought to quench, and blend
   With the surrounding maniacs, in the hell
   Where he had plunged it.  Glory without end
Scattered the clouds away--and on that name attend

XXXVII.

   The tears and praises of all time, while thine
   Would rot in its oblivion--in the sink
   Of worthless dust, which from thy boasted line
   Is shaken into nothing; but the link
   Thou formest in his fortunes bids us think
   Of thy poor malice, naming thee with scorn -
   Alfonso! how thy ducal pageants shrink
   From thee! if in another station born,
Scarce fit to be the slave of him thou mad'st to mourn:

XXXVIII.

   THOU! formed to eat, and be despised, and die,
   Even as the beasts that perish, save that thou
   Hadst a more splendid trough, and wider sty:
   HE! with a glory round his furrowed brow,
   Which emanated then, and dazzles now
   In face of all his foes, the Cruscan quire,
   And Boileau, whose rash envy could allow
   No strain which shamed his country's creaking lyre,
That whetstone of the teeth--monotony in wire!

XXXIX.

   Peace to Torquato's injured shade! 'twas his
   In life and death to be the mark where Wrong
   Aimed with their poisoned arrows--but to miss.
   Oh, victor unsurpassed in modern song!
   Each year brings forth its millions; but how long
   The tide of generations shall roll on,
   And not the whole combined and countless throng
   Compose a mind like thine?  Though all in one
Condensed their scattered rays, they would not form a sun.

XL.

   Great as thou art, yet paralleled by those
   Thy countrymen, before thee born to shine,
   The bards of Hell and Chivalry:  first rose
   The Tuscan father's comedy divine;
   Then, not unequal to the Florentine,
   The Southern Scott, the minstrel who called forth
   A new creation with his magic line,
   And, like the Ariosto of the North,
Sang ladye-love and war, romance and knightly worth.

XLI.

   The lightning rent from Ariosto's bust
   The iron crown of laurel's mimicked leaves;
   Nor was the ominous element unjust,
   For the true laurel-wreath which Glory weaves
   Is of the tree no bolt of thunder cleaves,
   And the false semblance but disgraced his brow;
   Yet still, if fondly Superstition grieves,
   Know that the lightning sanctifies below
Whate'er it strikes;--yon head is doubly sacred now.

XLII.

   Italia!  O Italia! thou who hast
   The fatal gift of beauty, which became
   A funeral dower of present woes and past,
   On thy sweet brow is sorrow ploughed by shame,
   And annals graved in characters of flame.
   Oh God! that thou wert in thy nakedness
   Less lovely or more powerful, and couldst claim
   Thy right, and awe the robbers back, who press
To shed thy blood, and drink the tears of thy distress;

XLIII.

   Then mightst thou more appal; or, less desired,
   Be homely and be peaceful, undeplored
   For thy destructive charms; then, still untired,
   Would not be seen the armed torrents poured
   Down the deep Alps; nor would the hostile horde
   Of many-nationed spoilers from the Po
   Quaff blood and water; nor the stranger's sword
   Be thy sad weapon of defence, and so,
Victor or vanquished, thou the slave of friend or foe.

XLIV.

   Wandering in youth, I traced the path of him,
   The Roman friend of Rome's least mortal mind,
   The friend of Tully:  as my bark did skim
   The bright blue waters with a fanning wind,
   Came Megara before me, and behind
   AEgina lay, Piraeus on the right,
   And Corinth on the left; I lay reclined
   Along the prow, and saw all these unite
In ruin, even as he had seen the desolate sight;

XLV.

   For time hath not rebuilt them, but upreared
   Barbaric dwellings on their shattered site,
   Which only make more mourned and more endeared
   The few last rays of their far-scattered light,
   And the crushed relics of their vanished might.
   The Roman saw these tombs in his own age,
   These sepulchres of cities, which excite
   Sad wonder, and his yet surviving page
The moral lesson bears, drawn from such pilgrimage.

XLVI.

   That page is now before me, and on mine
   HIS country's ruin added to the mass
   Of perished states he mourned in their decline,
   And I in desolation:  all that WAS
   Of then destruction IS; and now, alas!
   Rome--Rome imperial, bows her to the storm,
   In the same dust and blackness, and we pass
   The skeleton of her Titanic form,
Wrecks of another world, whose ashes still are warm.

XLVII.

   Yet, Italy! through every other land
   Thy wrongs should ring, and shall, from side to side;
   Mother of Arts! as once of Arms; thy hand
   Was then our Guardian, and is still our guide;
   Parent of our religion! whom the wide
   Nations have knelt to for the keys of heaven!
   Europe, repentant of her parricide,
   Shall yet redeem thee, and, all backward driven,
Roll the barbarian tide, and sue to be forgiven.

XLVIII.

   But Arno wins us to the fair white walls,
   Where the Etrurian Athens claims and keeps
   A softer feeling for her fairy halls.
   Girt by her theatre of hills, she reaps
   Her corn, and wine, and oil, and Plenty leaps
   To laughing life, with her redundant horn.
   Along the banks where smiling Arno sweeps,
   Was modern Luxury of Commerce born,
And buried Learning rose, redeemed to a new morn.

XLIX.

   There, too, the goddess loves in stone, and fills
   The air around with beauty; we inhale
   The ambrosial aspect, which, beheld, instils
   Part of its immortality; the veil
   Of heaven is half undrawn; within the pale
   We stand, and in that form and face behold
   What Mind can make, when Nature's self would fail;
   And to the fond idolaters of old
Envy the innate flash which such a soul could mould:

L.

   We gaze and turn away, and know not where,
   Dazzled and drunk with beauty, till the heart
   Reels with its fulness; there--for ever there -
   Chained to the chariot of triumphal Art,
   We stand as captives, and would not depart.
   Away!--there need no words, nor terms precise,
   The paltry jargon of the marble mart,
   Where Pedantry gulls Folly--we have eyes:
Blood, pulse, and breast, confirm the Dardan Shepherd's prize.

LI.

   Appearedst thou not to Paris in this guise?
   Or to more deeply blest Anchises? or,
   In all thy perfect goddess-ship, when lies
   Before thee thy own vanquished Lord of War?
   And gazing in thy face as toward a star,
   Laid on thy lap, his eyes to thee upturn,
   Feeding on thy sweet cheek! while thy lips are
   With lava kisses melting while they burn,
Showered on his eyelids, brow, and mouth, as from an urn!

LII.

   Glowing, and circumfused in speechless love,
   Their full divinity inadequate
   That feeling to express, or to improve,
   The gods become as mortals, and man's fate
   Has moments like their brightest! but the weight
   Of earth recoils upon us;--let it go!
   We can recall such visions, and create
   From what has been, or might be, things which grow,
Into thy statue's form, and look like gods below.

LIII.

   I leave to learned fingers, and wise hands,
   The artist and his ape, to teach and tell
   How well his connoisseurship understands
   The graceful bend, and the voluptuous swell:
   Let these describe the undescribable:
   I would not their vile breath should crisp the stream
   Wherein that image shall for ever dwell;
   The unruffled mirror of the loveliest dream
That ever left the sky on the deep soul to beam.

LIV.

   In Santa Croce's holy precincts lie
   Ashes which make it holier, dust which is
   E'en in itself an immortality,
   Though there were nothing save the past, and this
   The particle of those sublimities
   Which have relapsed to chaos: --here repose
   Angelo's, Alfieri's bones, and his,
   The starry Galileo, with his woes;
Here Machiavelli's earth returned to whence it rose.

LV.

   These are four minds, which, like the elements,
   Might furnish forth creation: --Italy!
   Time, which hath wronged thee with ten thousand rents
   Of thine imperial garment, shall deny,
   And hath denied, to every other sky,
   Spirits which soar from ruin: --thy decay
   Is still impregnate with divinity,
   Which gilds it with revivifying ray;
Such as the great of yore, Canova is to-day.

LVI.

   But where repose the all Etruscan three -
   Dante, and Petrarch, and, scarce less than they,
   The Bard of Prose, creative spirit! he
   Of the Hundred Tales of love--where did they lay
   Their bones, distinguished from our common clay
   In death as life?  Are they resolved to dust,
   And have their country's marbles nought to say?
   Could not her quarries furnish forth one bust?
Did they not to her breast their filial earth entrust?

LVII.

   Ungrateful Florence! Dante sleeps afar,
   Like Scipio, buried by the upbraiding shore;
   Thy factions, in their worse than civil war,
   Proscribed the bard whose name for evermore
   Their children's children would in vain adore
   With the remorse of ages; and the crown
   Which Petrarch's laureate brow supremely wore,
   Upon a far and foreign soil had grown,
His life, his fame, his grave, though rifled--not thine own.

LVIII.

   Boccaccio to his parent earth bequeathed
   His dust,--and lies it not her great among,
   With many a sweet and solemn requiem breathed
   O'er him who formed the Tuscan's siren tongue?
   That music in itself, whose sounds are song,
   The poetry of speech?  No;--even his tomb
   Uptorn, must bear the hyaena bigots' wrong,
   No more amidst the meaner dead find room,
Nor claim a passing sigh, because it told for WHOM?

LIX.

   And Santa Croce wants their mighty dust;
   Yet for this want more noted, as of yore
   The Caesar's pageant, shorn of Brutus' bust,
   Did but of Rome's best son remind her more:
   Happier Ravenna! on thy hoary shore,
   Fortress of falling empire! honoured sleeps
   The immortal exile;--Arqua, too, her store
   Of tuneful relics proudly claims and keeps,
While Florence vainly begs her banished dead, and weeps.

LX.

   What is her pyramid of precious stones?
   Of porphyry, jasper, agate, and all hues
   Of gem and marble, to encrust the bones
   Of merchant-dukes? the momentary dews
   Which, sparkling to the twilight stars, infuse
   Freshness in the green turf that wraps the dead,
   Whose names are mausoleums of the Muse,
   Are gently prest with far more reverent tread
Than ever paced the slab which paves the princely head.

LXI.

   There be more things to greet the heart and eyes
   In Arno's dome of Art's most princely shrine,
   Where Sculpture with her rainbow sister vies;
   There be more marvels yet--but not for mine;
   For I have been accustomed to entwine
   My thoughts with Nature rather in the fields
   Than Art in galleries:  though a work divine
   Calls for my spirit's homage, yet it yields
Less than it feels, because the weapon which it wields

LXII.

   Is of another temper, and I roam
   By Thrasimene's lake, in the defiles
   Fatal to Roman rashness, more at home;
   For there the Carthaginian's warlike wiles
   Come back before me, as his skill beguiles
   The host between the mountains and the shore,
   Where Courage falls in her despairing files,
   And torrents, swoll'n to rivers with their gore,
Reek through the sultry plain, with legions scattered o'er,

LXIII.

   Like to a forest felled by mountain winds;
   And such the storm of battle on this day,
   And such the frenzy, whose convulsion blinds
   To all save carnage, that, beneath the fray,
   An earthquake reeled unheededly away!
   None felt stern Nature rocking at his feet,
   And yawning forth a grave for those who lay
   Upon their bucklers for a winding-sheet;
Such is the absorbing hate when warring nations meet.

LXIV.

   The Earth to them was as a rolling bark
   Which bore them to Eternity; they saw
   The Ocean round, but had no time to mark
   The motions of their vessel:  Nature's law,
   In them suspended, recked not of the awe
   Which reigns when mountains tremble, and the birds
   Plunge in the clouds for refuge, and withdraw
   From their down-toppling nests; and bellowing herds
Stumble o'er heaving plains, and man's dread hath no words.

LXV.

   Far other scene is Thrasimene now;
   Her lake a sheet of silver, and her plain
   Rent by no ravage save the gentle plough;
   Her aged trees rise thick as once the slain
   Lay where their roots are; but a brook hath ta'en -
   A little rill of scanty stream and bed -
   A name of blood from that day's sanguine rain;
   And Sanguinetto tells ye where the dead
Made the earth wet, and turned the unwilling waters red.

LXVI.

   But thou, Clitumnus! in thy sweetest wave
   Of the most living crystal that was e'er
   The haunt of river nymph, to gaze and lave
   Her limbs where nothing hid them, thou dost rear
   Thy grassy banks whereon the milk-white steer
   Grazes; the purest god of gentle waters!
   And most serene of aspect, and most clear:
   Surely that stream was unprofaned by slaughters,
A mirror and a bath for Beauty's youngest daughters!

LXVII.

   And on thy happy shore a temple still,
   Of small and delicate proportion, keeps,
   Upon a mild declivity of hill,
   Its memory of thee; beneath it sweeps
   Thy current's calmness; oft from out it leaps
   The finny darter with the glittering scales,
   Who dwells and revels in thy glassy deeps;
   While, chance, some scattered water-lily sails
Down where the shallower wave still tells its bubbling tales.

LXVIII.

   Pass not unblest the genius of the place!
   If through the air a zephyr more serene
   Win to the brow, 'tis his; and if ye trace
   Along his margin a more eloquent green,
   If on the heart the freshness of the scene
   Sprinkle its coolness, and from the dry dust
   Of weary life a moment lave it clean
   With Nature's baptism,--'tis to him ye must
Pay orisons for this suspension of disgust.

LXIX.

   The roar of waters!--from the headlong height
   Velino cleaves the wave-worn precipice;
   The fall of waters! rapid as the light
   The flashing mass foams shaking the abyss;
   The hell of waters! where they howl and hiss,
   And boil in endless torture; while the sweat
   Of their great agony, wrung out from this
   Their Phlegethon, curls round the rocks of jet
That gird the gulf around, in pitiless horror set,

LXX.

   And mounts in spray the skies, and thence again
   Returns in an unceasing shower, which round,
   With its unemptied cloud of gentle rain,
   Is an eternal April to the ground,
   Making it all one emerald.  How profound
   The gulf! and how the giant element
   From rock to rock leaps with delirious bound,
   Crushing the cliffs, which, downward worn and rent
With his fierce footsteps, yield in chasms a fearful vent

LXXI.

   To the broad column which rolls on, and shows
   More like the fountain of an infant sea
   Torn from the womb of mountains by the throes
   Of a new world, than only thus to be
   Parent of rivers, which flow gushingly,
   With many windings through the vale: --Look back!
   Lo! where it comes like an eternity,
   As if to sweep down all things in its track,
Charming the eye with dread,--a matchless cataract,

LXXII.

   Horribly beautiful! but on the verge,
   From side to side, beneath the glittering morn,
   An Iris sits, amidst the infernal surge,
   Like Hope upon a deathbed, and, unworn
   Its steady dyes, while all around is torn
   By the distracted waters, bears serene
   Its brilliant hues with all their beams unshorn:
   Resembling, mid the torture of the scene,
Love watching Madness with unalterable mien.

LXXIII.

   Once more upon the woody Apennine,
   The infant Alps, which--had I not before
   Gazed on their mightier parents, where the pine
   Sits on more shaggy summits, and where roar
   The thundering lauwine--might be worshipped more;
   But I have seen the soaring Jungfrau rear
   Her never-trodden snow, and seen the hoar
   Glaciers of bleak Mont Blanc both far and near,
And in Chimari heard the thunder-hills of fear,

LXXIV.

   The Acroceraunian mountains of old name;
   And on Parnassus seen the eagles fly
   Like spirits of the spot, as 'twere for fame,
   For still they soared unutterably high:
   I've looked on Ida with a Trojan's eye;
   Athos, Olympus, AEtna, Atlas, made
   These hills seem things of lesser dignity,
   All, save the lone Soracte's height displayed,
Not NOW in snow, which asks the lyric Roman's aid

LXXV.

   For our remembrance, and from out the plain
   Heaves like a long-swept wave about to break,
   And on the curl hangs pausing:  not in vain
   May he who will his recollections rake,
   And quote in classic raptures, and awake
   The hills with Latian echoes; I abhorred
   Too much, to conquer for the poet's sake,
   The drilled dull lesson, forced down word by word
In my repugnant youth, with pleasure to record

LXXVI.

   Aught that recalls the daily drug which turned
   My sickening memory; and, though Time hath taught
   My mind to meditate what then it learned,
   Yet such the fixed inveteracy wrought
   By the impatience of my early thought,
   That, with the freshness wearing out before
   My mind could relish what it might have sought,
   If free to choose, I cannot now restore
Its health; but what it then detested, still abhor.

LXXVII.

   Then farewell, Horace; whom I hated so,
   Not for thy faults, but mine; it is a curse
   To understand, not feel, thy lyric flow,
   To comprehend, but never love thy verse,
   Although no deeper moralist rehearse
   Our little life, nor bard prescribe his art,
   Nor livelier satirist the conscience pierce,
   Awakening without wounding the touched heart,
Yet fare thee well--upon Soracte's ridge we part.

LXXVIII.

   O Rome! my country! city of the soul!
   The orphans of the heart must turn to thee,
   Lone mother of dead empires! and control
   In their shut breasts their petty misery.
   What are our woes and sufferance?  Come and see
   The cypress, hear the owl, and plod your way
   O'er steps of broken thrones and temples, Ye!
   Whose agonies are evils of a day--
A world is at our feet as fragile as our clay.

LXXIX.

   The Niobe of nations! there she stands,
   Childless and crownless, in her voiceless woe;
   An empty urn within her withered hands,
   Whose holy dust was scattered long ago;
   The Scipios' tomb contains no ashes now;
   The very sepulchres lie tenantless
   Of their heroic dwellers:  dost thou flow,
   Old Tiber! through a marble wilderness?
Rise, with thy yellow waves, and mantle her distress!

LXXX.

   The Goth, the Christian, Time, War, Flood, and Fire,
   Have dwelt upon the seven-hilled city's pride:
   She saw her glories star by star expire,
   And up the steep barbarian monarchs ride,
   Where the car climbed the Capitol; far and wide
   Temple and tower went down, nor left a site; -
   Chaos of ruins! who shall trace the void,
   O'er the dim fragments cast a lunar light,
And say, 'Here was, or is,' where all is doubly night?

LXXXI.

   The double night of ages, and of her,
   Night's daughter, Ignorance, hath wrapt, and wrap
   All round us; we but feel our way to err:
   The ocean hath its chart, the stars their map;
   And knowledge spreads them on her ample lap;
   But Rome is as the desert, where we steer
   Stumbling o'er recollections:  now we clap
   Our hands, and cry, 'Eureka!' it is clear -
When but some false mirage of ruin rises near.

LXXXII.

   Alas, the lofty city! and alas
   The trebly hundred triumphs! and the day
   When Brutus made the dagger's edge surpass
   The conqueror's sword in bearing fame away!
   Alas for Tully's voice, and Virgil's lay,
   And Livy's pictured page!  But these shall be
   Her resurrection; all beside--decay.
   Alas for Earth, for never shall we see
That brightness in her eye she bore when Rome was free!

LXXXIII.

   O thou, whose chariot rolled on Fortune's wheel,
   Triumphant Sylla!  Thou, who didst subdue
   Thy country's foes ere thou wouldst pause to feel
   The wrath of thy own wrongs, or reap the due
   Of hoarded vengeance till thine eagles flew
   O'er prostrate Asia;--thou, who with thy frown
   Annihilated senates--Roman, too,
   With all thy vices, for thou didst lay down
With an atoning smile a more than earthly crown -

LXXXIV.

   The dictatorial wreath,--couldst thou divine
   To what would one day dwindle that which made
   Thee more than mortal? and that so supine
   By aught than Romans Rome should thus be laid?
   She who was named eternal, and arrayed
   Her warriors but to conquer--she who veiled
   Earth with her haughty shadow, and displayed
   Until the o'er-canopied horizon failed,
Her rushing wings--Oh! she who was almighty hailed!

LXXXV.

   Sylla was first of victors; but our own,
   The sagest of usurpers, Cromwell!--he
   Too swept off senates while he hewed the throne
   Down to a block--immortal rebel!  See
   What crimes it costs to be a moment free
   And famous through all ages!  But beneath
   His fate the moral lurks of destiny;
   His day of double victory and death
Beheld him win two realms, and, happier, yield his breath.

LXXXVI.

   The third of the same moon whose former course
   Had all but crowned him, on the self-same day
   Deposed him gently from his throne of force,
   And laid him with the earth's preceding clay.
   And showed not Fortune thus how fame and sway,
   And all we deem delightful, and consume
   Our souls to compass through each arduous way,
   Are in her eyes less happy than the tomb?
Were they but so in man's, how different were his doom!

LXXXVII.

   And thou, dread statue! yet existent in
   The austerest form of naked majesty,
   Thou who beheldest, mid the assassins' din,
   At thy bathed base the bloody Caesar lie,
   Folding his robe in dying dignity,
   An offering to thine altar from the queen
   Of gods and men, great Nemesis! did he die,
   And thou, too, perish, Pompey? have ye been
Victors of countless kings, or puppets of a scene?

LXXXVIII.

   And thou, the thunder-stricken nurse of Rome!
   She-wolf! whose brazen-imaged dugs impart
   The milk of conquest yet within the dome
   Where, as a monument of antique art,
   Thou standest: --Mother of the mighty heart,
   Which the great founder sucked from thy wild teat,
   Scorched by the Roman Jove's ethereal dart,
   And thy limbs blacked with lightning--dost thou yet
Guard thine immortal cubs, nor thy fond charge forget?

LXXXIX.

   Thou dost;--but all thy foster-babes are dead -
   The men of iron; and the world hath reared
   Cities from out their sepulchres:  men bled
   In imitation of the things they feared,
   And fought and conquered, and the same course steered,
   At apish distance; but as yet none have,
   Nor could, the same supremacy have neared,
   Save one vain man, who is not in the grave,
But, vanquished by himself, to his own slaves a slave,

XC.

   The fool of false dominion--and a kind
   Of bastard Caesar, following him of old
   With steps unequal; for the Roman's mind
   Was modelled in a less terrestrial mould,
   With passions fiercer, yet a judgment cold,
   And an immortal instinct which redeemed
   The frailties of a heart so soft, yet bold.
   Alcides with the distaff now he seemed
At Cleopatra's feet, and now himself he beamed.

XCI.

   And came, and saw, and conquered.  But the man
   Who would have tamed his eagles down to flee,
   Like a trained falcon, in the Gallic van,
   Which he, in sooth, long led to victory,
   With a deaf heart which never seemed to be
   A listener to itself, was strangely framed;
   With but one weakest weakness--vanity:
   Coquettish in ambition, still he aimed
At what?  Can he avouch, or answer what he claimed?

XCII.

   And would be all or nothing--nor could wait
   For the sure grave to level him; few years
   Had fixed him with the Caesars in his fate,
   On whom we tread:  For THIS the conqueror rears
   The arch of triumph! and for this the tears
   And blood of earth flow on as they have flowed,
   An universal deluge, which appears
   Without an ark for wretched man's abode,
And ebbs but to reflow!--Renew thy rainbow, God!

XCIII.

   What from this barren being do we reap?
   Our senses narrow, and our reason frail,
   Life short, and truth a gem which loves the deep,
   And all things weighed in custom's falsest scale;
   Opinion an omnipotence, whose veil
   Mantles the earth with darkness, until right
   And wrong are accidents, and men grow pale
   Lest their own judgments should become too bright,
And their free thoughts be crimes, and earth have too much light.

XCIV.

   And thus they plod in sluggish misery,
   Rotting from sire to son, and age to age,
   Proud of their trampled nature, and so die,
   Bequeathing their hereditary rage
   To the new race of inborn slaves, who wage
   War for their chains, and rather than be free,
   Bleed gladiator-like, and still engage
   Within the same arena where they see
Their fellows fall before, like leaves of the same tree.

XCV.

   I speak not of men's creeds--they rest between
   Man and his Maker--but of things allowed,
   Averred, and known,--and daily, hourly seen -
   The yoke that is upon us doubly bowed,
   And the intent of tyranny avowed,
   The edict of Earth's rulers, who are grown
   The apes of him who humbled once the proud,
   And shook them from their slumbers on the throne;
Too glorious, were this all his mighty arm had done.

XCVI.

   Can tyrants but by tyrants conquered be,
   And Freedom find no champion and no child
   Such as Columbia saw arise when she
   Sprung forth a Pallas, armed and undefiled?
   Or must such minds be nourished in the wild,
   Deep in the unpruned forest, midst the roar
   Of cataracts, where nursing nature smiled
   On infant Washington?  Has Earth no more
Such seeds within her breast, or Europe no such shore?

XCVII.

   But France got drunk with blood to vomit crime,
   And fatal have her Saturnalia been
   To Freedom's cause, in every age and clime;
   Because the deadly days which we have seen,
   And vile Ambition, that built up between
   Man and his hopes an adamantine wall,
   And the base pageant last upon the scene,
   Are grown the pretext for the eternal thrall
Which nips Life's tree, and dooms man's worst--his second fall.

XCVIII.

   Yet, Freedom! yet thy banner, torn, but flying,
   Streams like the thunder-storm AGAINST the wind;
   Thy trumpet-voice, though broken now and dying,
   The loudest still the tempest leaves behind;
   Thy tree hath lost its blossoms, and the rind,
   Chopped by the axe, looks rough and little worth,
   But the sap lasts,--and still the seed we find
   Sown deep, even in the bosom of the North;
So shall a better spring less bitter fruit bring forth.

XCIX.

   There is a stern round tower of other days,
   Firm as a fortress, with its fence of stone,
   Such as an army's baffled strength delays,
   Standing with half its battlements alone,
   And with two thousand years of ivy grown,
   The garland of eternity, where wave
   The green leaves over all by time o'erthrown:
   What was this tower of strength? within its cave
What treasure lay so locked, so hid?--A woman's grave.

C.

   But who was she, the lady of the dead,
   Tombed in a palace?  Was she chaste and fair?
   Worthy a king's--or more--a Roman's bed?
   What race of chiefs and heroes did she bear?
   What daughter of her beauties was the heir?
   How lived--how loved--how died she?  Was she not
   So honoured--and conspicuously there,
   Where meaner relics must not dare to rot,
Placed to commemorate a more than mortal lot?

CI.

   Was she as those who love their lords, or they
   Who love the lords of others? such have been
   Even in the olden time, Rome's annals say.
   Was she a matron of Cornelia's mien,
   Or the light air of Egypt's graceful queen,
   Profuse of joy; or 'gainst it did she war,
   Inveterate in virtue?  Did she lean
   To the soft side of the heart, or wisely bar
Love from amongst her griefs?--for such the affections are.

CII.

   Perchance she died in youth:  it may be, bowed
   With woes far heavier than the ponderous tomb
   That weighed upon her gentle dust, a cloud
   Might gather o'er her beauty, and a gloom
   In her dark eye, prophetic of the doom
   Heaven gives its favourites--early death; yet shed
   A sunset charm around her, and illume
   With hectic light, the Hesperus of the dead,
Of her consuming cheek the autumnal leaf-like red.

CIII.

   Perchance she died in age--surviving all,
   Charms, kindred, children--with the silver grey
   On her long tresses, which might yet recall,
   It may be, still a something of the day
   When they were braided, and her proud array
   And lovely form were envied, praised, and eyed
   By Rome--But whither would Conjecture stray?
   Thus much alone we know--Metella died,
The wealthiest Roman's wife:  Behold his love or pride!

CIV.

   I know not why--but standing thus by thee
   It seems as if I had thine inmate known,
   Thou Tomb! and other days come back on me
   With recollected music, though the tone
   Is changed and solemn, like the cloudy groan
   Of dying thunder on the distant wind;
   Yet could I seat me by this ivied stone
   Till I had bodied forth the heated mind,
Forms from the floating wreck which ruin leaves behind;

CV.

   And from the planks, far shattered o'er the rocks,
   Built me a little bark of hope, once more
   To battle with the ocean and the shocks
   Of the loud breakers, and the ceaseless roar
   Which rushes on the solitary shore
   Where all lies foundered that was ever dear:
   But could I gather from the wave-worn store
   Enough for my rude boat, where should I steer?
There woos no home, nor hope, nor life, save what is here.

CVI.

   Then let the winds howl on! their harmony
   Shall henceforth be my music, and the night
   The sound shall temper with the owlet's cry,
   As I now hear them, in the fading light
   Dim o'er the bird of darkness' native site,
   Answer each other on the Palatine,
   With their large eyes, all glistening grey and bright,
   And sailing pinions.--Upon such a shrine
What are our petty griefs?--let me not number mine.

CVII.

   Cypress and ivy, weed and wallflower grown
   Matted and massed together, hillocks heaped
   On what were chambers, arch crushed, column strown
   In fragments, choked-up vaults, and frescoes steeped
   In subterranean damps, where the owl peeped,
   Deeming it midnight: --Temples, baths, or halls?
   Pronounce who can; for all that Learning reaped
   From her research hath been, that these are walls -
Behold the Imperial Mount! 'tis thus the mighty falls.

CVIII.

   There is the moral of all human tales:
   'Tis but the same rehearsal of the past,
   First Freedom, and then Glory--when that fails,
   Wealth, vice, corruption--barbarism at last.
   And History, with all her volumes vast,
   Hath but ONE page,--'tis better written here,
   Where gorgeous Tyranny hath thus amassed
   All treasures, all delights, that eye or ear,
Heart, soul could seek, tongue ask--Away with words! draw near,

CIX.

   Admire, exult--despise--laugh, weep--for here
   There is such matter for all feeling: --Man!
   Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear,
   Ages and realms are crowded in this span,
   This mountain, whose obliterated plan
   The pyramid of empires pinnacled,
   Of Glory's gewgaws shining in the van
   Till the sun's rays with added flame were filled!
Where are its golden roofs? where those who dared to build?

CX.

   Tully was not so eloquent as thou,
   Thou nameless column with the buried base!
   What are the laurels of the Caesar's brow?
   Crown me with ivy from his dwelling-place.
   Whose arch or pillar meets me in the face,
   Titus or Trajan's?  No; 'tis that of Time:
   Triumph, arch, pillar, all he doth displace,
   Scoffing; and apostolic statues climb
To crush the imperial urn, whose ashes slept sublime,

CXI.

   Buried in air, the deep blue sky of Rome,
   And looking to the stars; they had contained
   A spirit which with these would find a home,
   The last of those who o'er the whole earth reigned,
   The Roman globe, for after none sustained
   But yielded back his conquests: --he was more
   Than a mere Alexander, and unstained
   With household blood and wine, serenely wore
His sovereign virtues--still we Trajan's name adore.

CXII.

   Where is the rock of Triumph, the high place
   Where Rome embraced her heroes? where the steep
   Tarpeian--fittest goal of Treason's race,
   The promontory whence the traitor's leap
   Cured all ambition?  Did the Conquerors heap
   Their spoils here?  Yes; and in yon field below,
   A thousand years of silenced factions sleep -
   The Forum, where the immortal accents glow,
And still the eloquent air breathes--burns with Cicero!

CXIII.

   The field of freedom, faction, fame, and blood:
   Here a proud people's passions were exhaled,
   From the first hour of empire in the bud
   To that when further worlds to conquer failed;
   But long before had Freedom's face been veiled,
   And Anarchy assumed her attributes:
   Till every lawless soldier who assailed
   Trod on the trembling Senate's slavish mutes,
Or raised the venal voice of baser prostitutes.

CXIV.

   Then turn we to our latest tribune's name,
   From her ten thousand tyrants turn to thee,
   Redeemer of dark centuries of shame -
   The friend of Petrarch--hope of Italy -
   Rienzi! last of Romans!  While the tree
   Of freedom's withered trunk puts forth a leaf,
   Even for thy tomb a garland let it be--
   The forum's champion, and the people's chief -
Her new-born Numa thou, with reign, alas! too brief.

CXV.

   Egeria! sweet creation of some heart
   Which found no mortal resting-place so fair
   As thine ideal breast; whate'er thou art
   Or wert,--a young Aurora of the air,
   The nympholepsy of some fond despair;
   Or, it might be, a beauty of the earth,
   Who found a more than common votary there
   Too much adoring; whatsoe'er thy birth,
Thou wert a beautiful thought, and softly bodied forth.

CXVI.

   The mosses of thy fountain still are sprinkled
   With thine Elysian water-drops; the face
   Of thy cave-guarded spring, with years unwrinkled,
   Reflects the meek-eyed genius of the place,
   Whose green wild margin now no more erase
   Art's works; nor must the delicate waters sleep,
   Prisoned in marble, bubbling from the base
   Of the cleft statue, with a gentle leap
The rill runs o'er, and round, fern, flowers, and ivy creep,

CXVII.

   Fantastically tangled; the green hills
   Are clothed with early blossoms, through the grass
   The quick-eyed lizard rustles, and the bills
   Of summer birds sing welcome as ye pass;
   Flowers fresh in hue, and many in their class,
   Implore the pausing step, and with their dyes
   Dance in the soft breeze in a fairy mass;
   The sweetness of the violet's deep blue eyes,
Kissed by the breath of heaven, seems coloured by its skies.

CXVIII.

   Here didst thou dwell, in this enchanted cover,
   Egeria! thy all heavenly bosom beating
   For the far footsteps of thy mortal lover;
   The purple Midnight veiled that mystic meeting
   With her most starry canopy, and seating
   Thyself by thine adorer, what befell?
   This cave was surely shaped out for the greeting
   Of an enamoured Goddess, and the cell
Haunted by holy Love--the earliest oracle!

CXIX.

   And didst thou not, thy breast to his replying,
   Blend a celestial with a human heart;
   And Love, which dies as it was born, in sighing,
   Share with immortal transports? could thine art
   Make them indeed immortal, and impart
   The purity of heaven to earthly joys,
   Expel the venom and not blunt the dart -
   The dull satiety which all destroys--
And root from out the soul the deadly weed which cloys?

CXX.

   Alas! our young affections run to waste,
   Or water but the desert:  whence arise
   But weeds of dark luxuriance, tares of haste,
   Rank at the core, though tempting to the eyes,
   Flowers whose wild odours breathe but agonies,
   And trees whose gums are poison; such the plants
   Which spring beneath her steps as Passion flies
   O'er the world's wilderness, and vainly pants
For some celestial fruit forbidden to our wants.

CXXI.

   O Love! no habitant of earth thou art -
   An unseen seraph, we believe in thee,--
   A faith whose martyrs are the broken heart,
   But never yet hath seen, nor e'er shall see,
   The naked eye, thy form, as it should be;
   The mind hath made thee, as it peopled heaven,
   Even with its own desiring phantasy,
   And to a thought such shape and image given,
As haunts the unquenched soul--parched--wearied--wrung--and riven.

CXXII.

   Of its own beauty is the mind diseased,
   And fevers into false creation;--where,
   Where are the forms the sculptor's soul hath seized?
   In him alone.  Can Nature show so fair?
   Where are the charms and virtues which we dare
   Conceive in boyhood and pursue as men,
   The unreached Paradise of our despair,
   Which o'er-informs the pencil and the pen,
And overpowers the page where it would bloom again.

CXXIII.

   Who loves, raves--'tis youth's frenzy--but the cure
   Is bitterer still; as charm by charm unwinds
   Which robed our idols, and we see too sure
   Nor worth nor beauty dwells from out the mind's
   Ideal shape of such; yet still it binds
   The fatal spell, and still it draws us on,
   Reaping the whirlwind from the oft-sown winds;
   The stubborn heart, its alchemy begun,
Seems ever near the prize--wealthiest when most undone.

CXXIV.

   We wither from our youth, we gasp away -
   Sick--sick; unfound the boon, unslaked the thirst,
   Though to the last, in verge of our decay,
   Some phantom lures, such as we sought at first -
   But all too late,--so are we doubly curst.
   Love, fame, ambition, avarice--'tis the same -
   Each idle, and all ill, and none the worst -
   For all are meteors with a different name,
And death the sable smoke where vanishes the flame.

CXXV.

   Few--none--find what they love or could have loved:
   Though accident, blind contact, and the strong
   Necessity of loving, have removed
   Antipathies--but to recur, ere long,
   Envenomed with irrevocable wrong;
   And Circumstance, that unspiritual god
   And miscreator, makes and helps along
   Our coming evils with a crutch-like rod,
Whose touch turns hope to dust--the dust we all have trod.

CXXVI.

   Our life is a false nature--'tis not in
   The harmony of things,--this hard decree,
   This uneradicable taint of sin,
   This boundless upas, this all-blasting tree,
   Whose root is earth, whose leaves and branches be
   The skies which rain their plagues on men like dew -
   Disease, death, bondage, all the woes we see--
   And worse, the woes we see not--which throb through
The immedicable soul, with heart-aches ever new.

CXXVII.

   Yet let us ponder boldly--'tis a base
   Abandonment of reason to resign
   Our right of thought--our last and only place
   Of refuge; this, at least, shall still be mine:
   Though from our birth the faculty divine
   Is chained and tortured--cabined, cribbed, confined,
   And bred in darkness, lest the truth should shine
   Too brightly on the unprepared mind,
The beam pours in, for time and skill will couch the blind.

CXXVIII.

   Arches on arches! as it were that Rome,
   Collecting the chief trophies of her line,
   Would build up all her triumphs in one dome,
   Her Coliseum stands; the moonbeams shine
   As 'twere its natural torches, for divine
   Should be the light which streams here, to illume
   This long explored but still exhaustless mine
   Of contemplation; and the azure gloom
Of an Italian night, where the deep skies assume

CXXIX.

   Hues which have words, and speak to ye of heaven,
   Floats o'er this vast and wondrous monument,
   And shadows forth its glory.  There is given
   Unto the things of earth, which Time hath bent,
   A spirit's feeling, and where he hath leant
   His hand, but broke his scythe, there is a power
   And magic in the ruined battlement,
   For which the palace of the present hour
Must yield its pomp, and wait till ages are its dower.

CXXX.

   O Time! the beautifier of the dead,
   Adorner of the ruin, comforter
   And only healer when the heart hath bled -
   Time! the corrector where our judgments err,
   The test of truth, love,--sole philosopher,
   For all beside are sophists, from thy thrift,
   Which never loses though it doth defer -
   Time, the avenger! unto thee I lift
My hands, and eyes, and heart, and crave of thee a gift:

CXXXI.

   Amidst this wreck, where thou hast made a shrine
   And temple more divinely desolate,
   Among thy mightier offerings here are mine,
   Ruins of years--though few, yet full of fate:
   If thou hast ever seen me too elate,
   Hear me not; but if calmly I have borne
   Good, and reserved my pride against the hate
   Which shall not whelm me, let me not have worn
This iron in my soul in vain--shall THEY not mourn?

CXXXII.

   And thou, who never yet of human wrong
   Left the unbalanced scale, great Nemesis!
   Here, where the ancients paid thee homage long -
   Thou, who didst call the Furies from the abyss,
   And round Orestes bade them howl and hiss
   For that unnatural retribution--just,
   Had it but been from hands less near--in this
   Thy former realm, I call thee from the dust!
Dost thou not hear my heart?--Awake! thou shalt, and must.

CXXXIII.

   It is not that I may not have incurred
   For my ancestral faults or mine the wound
   I bleed withal, and had it been conferred
   With a just weapon, it had flowed unbound.
   But now my blood shall not sink in the ground;
   To thee I do devote it--THOU shalt take
   The vengeance, which shall yet be sought and found,
   Which if _I_ have not taken for the sake -
But let that pass--I sleep, but thou shalt yet awake.

CXXXIV.

   And if my voice break forth, 'tis not that now
   I shrink from what is suffered:  let him speak
   Who hath beheld decline upon my brow,
   Or seen my mind's convulsion leave it weak;
   But in this page a record will I seek.
   Not in the air shall these my words disperse,
   Though I be ashes; a far hour shall wreak
   The deep prophetic fulness of this verse,
And pile on human heads the mountain of my curse!

CXXXV.

   That curse shall be forgiveness.--Have I not -
   Hear me, my mother Earth! behold it, Heaven! -
   Have I not had to wrestle with my lot?
   Have I not suffered things to be forgiven?
   Have I not had my brain seared, my heart riven,
   Hopes sapped, name blighted, Life's life lied away?
   And only not to desperation driven,
   Because not altogether of such clay
As rots into the souls of those whom I survey.

CXXXVI.

   From mighty wrongs to petty perfidy
   Have I not seen what human things could do?
   From the loud roar of foaming calumny
   To the small whisper of the as paltry few
   And subtler venom of the reptile crew,
   The Janus glance of whose significant eye,
   Learning to lie with silence, would SEEM true,
   And without utterance, save the shrug or sigh,
Deal round to happy fools its speechless obloquy.

CXXXVII.

   But I have lived, and have not lived in vain:
   My mind may lose its force, my blood its fire,
   And my frame perish even in conquering pain,
   But there is that within me which shall tire
   Torture and Time, and breathe when I expire:
   Something unearthly, which they deem not of,
   Like the remembered tone of a mute lyre,
   Shall on their softened spirits sink, and move
In hearts all rocky now the late remorse of love.

CXXXVIII.

   The seal is set.--Now welcome, thou dread Power
   Nameless, yet thus omnipotent, which here
   Walk'st in the shadow of the midnight hour
   With a deep awe, yet all distinct from fear:
   Thy haunts are ever where the dead walls rear
   Their ivy mantles, and the solemn scene
   Derives from thee a sense so deep and clear
   That we become a part of what has been,
And grow unto the spot, all-seeing but unseen.

CXXXIX.

   And here the buzz of eager nations ran,
   In murmured pity, or loud-roared applause,
   As man was slaughtered by his fellow-man.
   And wherefore slaughtered? wherefore, but because
   Such were the bloody circus' genial laws,
   And the imperial pleasure.--Wherefore not?
   What matters where we fall to fill the maws
   Of worms--on battle-plains or listed spot?
Both are but theatres where the chief actors rot.

CXL.

   I see before me the Gladiator lie:
   He leans upon his hand--his manly brow
   Consents to death, but conquers agony,
   And his drooped head sinks gradually low -
   And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow
   From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,
   Like the first of a thunder-shower; and now
   The arena swims around him:  he is gone,
Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the wretch who won.

CXLI.

   He heard it, but he heeded not--his eyes
   Were with his heart, and that was far away;
   He recked not of the life he lost nor prize,
   But where his rude hut by the Danube lay,
   THERE were his young barbarians all at play,
   THERE was their Dacian mother--he, their sire,
   Butchered to make a Roman holiday -
   All this rushed with his blood--Shall he expire,
And unavenged?--Arise! ye Goths, and glut your ire!

CXLII.

   But here, where murder breathed her bloody steam;
   And here, where buzzing nations choked the ways,
   And roared or murmured like a mountain-stream
   Dashing or winding as its torrent strays;
   Here, where the Roman million's blame or praise
   Was death or life, the playthings of a crowd,
   My voice sounds much--and fall the stars' faint rays
   On the arena void--seats crushed, walls bowed,
And galleries, where my steps seem echoes strangely loud.

CXLIII.

   A ruin--yet what ruin! from its mass
   Walls, palaces, half-cities, have been reared;
   Yet oft the enormous skeleton ye pass,
   And marvel where the spoil could have appeared.
   Hath it indeed been plundered, or but cleared?
   Alas! developed, opens the decay,
   When the colossal fabric's form is neared:
   It will not bear the brightness of the day,
Which streams too much on all, years, man, have reft away.

CXLIV.

   But when the rising moon begins to climb
   Its topmost arch, and gently pauses there;
   When the stars twinkle through the loops of time,
   And the low night-breeze waves along the air,
   The garland-forest, which the grey walls wear,
   Like laurels on the bald first Caesar's head;
   When the light shines serene, but doth not glare,
   Then in this magic circle raise the dead:
Heroes have trod this spot--'tis on their dust ye tread.

CXLV.

   'While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand;
   When falls the Coliseum, Rome shall fall;
   And when Rome falls--the World.'  From our own land
   Thus spake the pilgrims o'er this mighty wall
   In Saxon times, which we are wont to call
   Ancient; and these three mortal things are still
   On their foundations, and unaltered all;
   Rome and her Ruin past Redemption's skill,
The World, the same wide den--of thieves, or what ye will.

CXLVI.

   Simple, erect, severe, austere, sublime -
   Shrine of all saints and temple of all gods,
   From Jove to Jesus--spared and blest by time;
   Looking tranquillity, while falls or nods
   Arch, empire, each thing round thee, and man plods
   His way through thorns to ashes--glorious dome!
   Shalt thou not last?--Time's scythe and tyrants' rods
   Shiver upon thee--sanctuary and home
Of art and piety--Pantheon!--pride of Rome!

CXLVII.

   Relic of nobler days, and noblest arts!
   Despoiled yet perfect, with thy circle spreads
   A holiness appealing to all hearts--
   To art a model; and to him who treads
   Rome for the sake of ages, Glory sheds
   Her light through thy sole aperture; to those
   Who worship, here are altars for their beads;
   And they who feel for genius may repose
Their eyes on honoured forms, whose busts around them close.

CXLVIII.

   There is a dungeon, in whose dim drear light
   What do I gaze on?  Nothing:  Look again!
   Two forms are slowly shadowed on my sight -
   Two insulated phantoms of the brain:
   It is not so:  I see them full and plain -
   An old man, and a female young and fair,
   Fresh as a nursing mother, in whose vein
   The blood is nectar: --but what doth she there,
With her unmantled neck, and bosom white and bare?

CXLIX.

   Full swells the deep pure fountain of young life,
   Where ON the heart and FROM the heart we took
   Our first and sweetest nurture, when the wife,
   Blest into mother, in the innocent look,
   Or even the piping cry of lips that brook
   No pain and small suspense, a joy perceives
   Man knows not, when from out its cradled nook
   She sees her little bud put forth its leaves -
What may the fruit be yet?--I know not--Cain was Eve's.

CL.

   But here youth offers to old age the food,
   The milk of his own gift: --it is her sire
   To whom she renders back the debt of blood
   Born with her birth.  No; he shall not expire
   While in those warm and lovely veins the fire
   Of health and holy feeling can provide
   Great Nature's Nile, whose deep stream rises higher
   Than Egypt's river: --from that gentle side
Drink, drink and live, old man! heaven's realm holds no such tide.

CLI.

   The starry fable of the milky way
   Has not thy story's purity; it is
   A constellation of a sweeter ray,
   And sacred Nature triumphs more in this
   Reverse of her decree, than in the abyss
   Where sparkle distant worlds: --Oh, holiest nurse!
   No drop of that clear stream its way shall miss
   To thy sire's heart, replenishing its source
With life, as our freed souls rejoin the universe.

CLII.

   Turn to the mole which Hadrian reared on high,
   Imperial mimic of old Egypt's piles,
   Colossal copyist of deformity,
   Whose travelled phantasy from the far Nile's
   Enormous model, doomed the artist's toils
   To build for giants, and for his vain earth,
   His shrunken ashes, raise this dome:  How smiles
   The gazer's eye with philosophic mirth,
To view the huge design which sprung from such a birth!

CLIII.

   But lo! the dome--the vast and wondrous dome,
   To which Diana's marvel was a cell--
   Christ's mighty shrine above his martyr's tomb!
   I have beheld the Ephesian's miracle--
   Its columns strew the wilderness, and dwell
   The hyaena and the jackal in their shade;
   I have beheld Sophia's bright roofs swell
   Their glittering mass i' the sun, and have surveyed
Its sanctuary the while the usurping Moslem prayed;

CLIV.

   But thou, of temples old, or altars new,
   Standest alone--with nothing like to thee -
   Worthiest of God, the holy and the true,
   Since Zion's desolation, when that he
   Forsook his former city, what could be,
   Of earthly structures, in his honour piled,
   Of a sublimer aspect?  Majesty,
   Power, Glory, Strength, and Beauty, all are aisled
In this eternal ark of worship undefiled.

CLV.

   Enter:  its grandeur overwhelms thee not;
   And why? it is not lessened; but thy mind,
   Expanded by the genius of the spot,
   Has grown colossal, and can only find
   A fit abode wherein appear enshrined
   Thy hopes of immortality; and thou
   Shalt one day, if found worthy, so defined,
   See thy God face to face, as thou dost now
His Holy of Holies, nor be blasted by his brow.

CLVI.

   Thou movest--but increasing with th' advance,
   Like climbing some great Alp, which still doth rise,
   Deceived by its gigantic elegance;
   Vastness which grows--but grows to harmonise -
   All musical in its immensities;
   Rich marbles--richer painting--shrines where flame
   The lamps of gold--and haughty dome which vies
   In air with Earth's chief structures, though their frame
Sits on the firm-set ground--and this the clouds must claim.

CLVII.

   Thou seest not all; but piecemeal thou must break
   To separate contemplation, the great whole;
   And as the ocean many bays will make,
   That ask the eye--so here condense thy soul
   To more immediate objects, and control
   Thy thoughts until thy mind hath got by heart
   Its eloquent proportions, and unroll
   In mighty graduations, part by part,
The glory which at once upon thee did not dart.

CLVIII.

   Not by its fault--but thine:  Our outward sense
   Is but of gradual grasp--and as it is
   That what we have of feeling most intense
   Outstrips our faint expression; e'en so this
   Outshining and o'erwhelming edifice
   Fools our fond gaze, and greatest of the great
   Defies at first our nature's littleness,
   Till, growing with its growth, we thus dilate
Our spirits to the size of that they contemplate.

CLIX.

   Then pause and be enlightened; there is more
   In such a survey than the sating gaze
   Of wonder pleased, or awe which would adore
   The worship of the place, or the mere praise
   Of art and its great masters, who could raise
   What former time, nor skill, nor thought could plan;
   The fountain of sublimity displays
   Its depth, and thence may draw the mind of man
Its golden sands, and learn what great conceptions can.

CLX.

   Or, turning to the Vatican, go see
   Laocoon's torture dignifying pain -
   A father's love and mortal's agony
   With an immortal's patience blending: --Vain
   The struggle; vain, against the coiling strain
   And gripe, and deepening of the dragon's grasp,
   The old man's clench; the long envenomed chain
   Rivets the living links,--the enormous asp
Enforces pang on pang, and stifles gasp on gasp.

CLXI.

   Or view the Lord of the unerring bow,
   The God of life, and poesy, and light -
   The Sun in human limbs arrayed, and brow
   All radiant from his triumph in the fight;
   The shaft hath just been shot--the arrow bright
   With an immortal's vengeance; in his eye
   And nostril beautiful disdain, and might
   And majesty, flash their full lightnings by,
Developing in that one glance the Deity.

CLXII.

   But in his delicate form--a dream of Love,
   Shaped by some solitary nymph, whose breast
   Longed for a deathless lover from above,
   And maddened in that vision--are expressed
   All that ideal beauty ever blessed
   The mind within its most unearthly mood,
   When each conception was a heavenly guest -
   A ray of immortality--and stood
Starlike, around, until they gathered to a god?

CLXIII.

   And if it be Prometheus stole from heaven
   The fire which we endure, it was repaid
   By him to whom the energy was given
   Which this poetic marble hath arrayed
   With an eternal glory--which, if made
   By human hands, is not of human thought
   And Time himself hath hallowed it, nor laid
   One ringlet in the dust--nor hath it caught
A tinge of years, but breathes the flame with which 'twas wrought.

CLXIV.

   But where is he, the pilgrim of my song,
   The being who upheld it through the past?
   Methinks he cometh late and tarries long.
   He is no more--these breathings are his last;
   His wanderings done, his visions ebbing fast,
   And he himself as nothing: --if he was
   Aught but a phantasy, and could be classed
   With forms which live and suffer--let that pass -
His shadow fades away into Destruction's mass,

CLXV.

   Which gathers shadow, substance, life, and all
   That we inherit in its mortal shroud,
   And spreads the dim and universal pall
   Thro' which all things grow phantoms; and the cloud
   Between us sinks and all which ever glowed,
   Till Glory's self is twilight, and displays
   A melancholy halo scarce allowed
   To hover on the verge of darkness; rays
Sadder than saddest night, for they distract the gaze,

CLXVI.

   And send us prying into the abyss,
   To gather what we shall be when the frame
   Shall be resolved to something less than this
   Its wretched essence; and to dream of fame,
   And wipe the dust from off the idle name
   We never more shall hear,--but never more,
   Oh, happier thought! can we be made the same:
   It is enough, in sooth, that ONCE we bore
These fardels of the heart--the heart whose sweat was gore.

CLXVII.

   Hark! forth from the abyss a voice proceeds,
   A long, low distant murmur of dread sound,
   Such as arises when a nation bleeds
   With some deep and immedicable wound;
   Through storm and darkness yawns the rending ground.
   The gulf is thick with phantoms, but the chief
   Seems royal still, though with her head discrowned,
   And pale, but lovely, with maternal grief
She clasps a babe, to whom her breast yields no relief.

CLXVIII.

   Scion of chiefs and monarchs, where art thou?
   Fond hope of many nations, art thou dead?
   Could not the grave forget thee, and lay low
   Some less majestic, less beloved head?
   In the sad midnight, while thy heart still bled,
   The mother of a moment, o'er thy boy,
   Death hushed that pang for ever:  with thee fled
   The present happiness and promised joy
Which filled the imperial isles so full it seemed to cloy.

CLXIX.

   Peasants bring forth in safety.--Can it be,
   O thou that wert so happy, so adored!
   Those who weep not for kings shall weep for thee,
   And Freedom's heart, grown heavy, cease to hoard
   Her many griefs for One; for she had poured
   Her orisons for thee, and o'er thy head
   Beheld her Iris.--Thou, too, lonely lord,
   And desolate consort--vainly wert thou wed!
The husband of a year! the father of the dead!

CLXX.

   Of sackcloth was thy wedding garment made:
   Thy bridal's fruit is ashes; in the dust
   The fair-haired Daughter of the Isles is laid,
   The love of millions!  How we did entrust
   Futurity to her! and, though it must
   Darken above our bones, yet fondly deemed
   Our children should obey her child, and blessed
   Her and her hoped-for seed, whose promise seemed
Like star to shepherd's eyes; 'twas but a meteor beamed.

CLXXI.

   Woe unto us, not her; for she sleeps well:
   The fickle reek of popular breath, the tongue
   Of hollow counsel, the false oracle,
   Which from the birth of monarchy hath rung
   Its knell in princely ears, till the o'erstrung
   Nations have armed in madness, the strange fate
   Which tumbles mightiest sovereigns, and hath flung
   Against their blind omnipotence a weight
Within the opposing scale, which crushes soon or late, -

CLXXII.

   These might have been her destiny; but no,
   Our hearts deny it:  and so young, so fair,
   Good without effort, great without a foe;
   But now a bride and mother--and now THERE!
   How many ties did that stern moment tear!
   From thy Sire's to his humblest subject's breast
   Is linked the electric chain of that despair,
   Whose shock was as an earthquake's, and oppressed
The land which loved thee so, that none could love thee best.

CLXXIII.

   Lo, Nemi! navelled in the woody hills
   So far, that the uprooting wind which tears
   The oak from his foundation, and which spills
   The ocean o'er its boundary, and bears
   Its foam against the skies, reluctant spares
   The oval mirror of thy glassy lake;
   And, calm as cherished hate, its surface wears
   A deep cold settled aspect nought can shake,
All coiled into itself and round, as sleeps the snake.

CLXXIV.

   And near Albano's scarce divided waves
   Shine from a sister valley;--and afar
   The Tiber winds, and the broad ocean laves
   The Latian coast where sprung the Epic war,
   'Arms and the Man,' whose reascending star
   Rose o'er an empire,--but beneath thy right
   Tully reposed from Rome;--and where yon bar
   Of girdling mountains intercepts the sight,
The Sabine farm was tilled, the weary bard's delight.

CLXXV.

   But I forget.--My pilgrim's shrine is won,
   And he and I must part,--so let it be, -
   His task and mine alike are nearly done;
   Yet once more let us look upon the sea:
   The midland ocean breaks on him and me,
   And from the Alban mount we now behold
   Our friend of youth, that ocean, which when we
   Beheld it last by Calpe's rock unfold
Those waves, we followed on till the dark Euxine rolled

CLXXVI.

   Upon the blue Symplegades:  long years -
   Long, though not very many--since have done
   Their work on both; some suffering and some tears
   Have left us nearly where we had begun:
   Yet not in vain our mortal race hath run,
   We have had our reward--and it is here;
   That we can yet feel gladdened by the sun,
   And reap from earth, sea, joy almost as dear
As if there were no man to trouble what is clear.

CLXXVII.

   Oh! that the Desert were my dwelling-place,
   With one fair Spirit for my minister,
   That I might all forget the human race,
   And, hating no one, love but only her!
   Ye Elements!--in whose ennobling stir
   I feel myself exalted--can ye not
   Accord me such a being?  Do I err
   In deeming such inhabit many a spot?
Though with them to converse can rarely be our lot.

CLXXVIII.

   There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
   There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
   There is society where none intrudes,
   By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:
   I love not Man the less, but Nature more,
   From these our interviews, in which I steal
   From all I may be, or have been before,
   To mingle with the Universe, and feel
What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.

CLXXIX.

   Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll!
   Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;
   Man marks the earth with ruin--his control
   Stops with the shore;--upon the watery plain
   The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain
   A shadow of man's ravage, save his own,
   When for a moment, like a drop of rain,
   He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,
Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.

CLXXX.

   His steps are not upon thy paths,--thy fields
   Are not a spoil for him,--thou dost arise
   And shake him from thee; the vile strength he wields
   For earth's destruction thou dost all despise,
   Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies,
   And send'st him, shivering in thy playful spray
   And howling, to his gods, where haply lies
   His petty hope in some near port or bay,
And dashest him again to earth: --there let him lay.

CLXXXI.

   The armaments which thunderstrike the walls
   Of rock-built cities, bidding nations quake,
   And monarchs tremble in their capitals.
   The oak leviathans, whose huge ribs make
   Their clay creator the vain title take
   Of lord of thee, and arbiter of war;
   These are thy toys, and, as the snowy flake,
   They melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar
Alike the Armada's pride, or spoils of Trafalgar.

CLXXXII.

   Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee -
   Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, what are they?
   Thy waters washed them power while they were free
   And many a tyrant since:  their shores obey
   The stranger, slave, or savage; their decay
   Has dried up realms to deserts:  not so thou,
   Unchangeable save to thy wild waves' play -
   Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow -
Such as creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now.

CLXXXIII.

   Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty's form
   Glasses itself in tempests; in all time,
   Calm or convulsed--in breeze, or gale, or storm,
   Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime
   Dark-heaving;--boundless, endless, and sublime -
   The image of Eternity--the throne
   Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime
   The monsters of the deep are made; each zone
Obeys thee:  thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone.

CLXXXIV.

   And I have loved thee, Ocean! and my joy
   Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be
   Borne like thy bubbles, onward:  from a boy
   I wantoned with thy breakers--they to me
   Were a delight; and if the freshening sea
   Made them a terror--'twas a pleasing fear,
   For I was as it were a child of thee,
   And trusted to thy billows far and near,
And laid my hand upon thy mane--as I do here.

CLXXXV.

   My task is done--my song hath ceased--my theme
   Has died into an echo; it is fit
   The spell should break of this protracted dream.
   The torch shall be extinguished which hath lit
   My midnight lamp--and what is writ, is writ -
   Would it were worthier! but I am not now
   That which I have been--and my visions flit
   Less palpably before me--and the glow
Which in my spirit dwelt is fluttering, faint, and low.

CLXXXVI.

   Farewell! a word that must be, and hath been -
   A sound which makes us linger; yet, farewell!
   Ye, who have traced the Pilgrim to the scene
   Which is his last, if in your memories dwell
   A thought which once was his, if on ye swell
   A single recollection, not in vain
   He wore his sandal-shoon and scallop shell;
   Farewell! with HIM alone may rest the pain,
If such there were--with YOU, the moral of his strain.

DEDICATION

     Bob Southey! You're a poet, poet laureate,
       And representative of all the race.
     Although 'tis true that you turned out a Tory at
       Last, yours has lately been a common case.
     And now my epic renegade, what are ye at
       With all the lakers, in and out of place?
     A nest of tuneful persons, to my eye
     Like four and twenty blackbirds in a pye,

     Which pye being opened they began to sing'
       (This old song and new simile holds good),
     'A dainty dish to set before the King'
       Or Regent, who admires such kind of food.
     And Coleridge too has lately taken wing,
       But like a hawk encumbered with his hood,
     Explaining metaphysics to the nation.
     I wish he would explain his explanation.

     You, Bob, are rather insolent, you know,
       At being disappointed in your wish
     To supersede all warblers here below,
       And be the only blackbird in the dish.
     And then you overstrain yourself, or so,
       And tumble downward like the flying fish
     Gasping on deck, because you soar too high,
     Bob, And fall for lack of moisture quite a dry Bob.

     And Wordsworth in a rather long Excursion
       (I think the quarto holds five hundred pages)
     Has given a sample from the vasty version
       Of his new system to perplex the sages.
     'Tis poetry, at least by his assertion,
       And may appear so when the Dog Star rages,
     And he who understands it would be able
     To add a story to the tower of Babel.

     You gentlemen, by dint of long seclusion
       From better company, have kept your own
     At Keswick, and through still continued fusion
       Of one another's minds at last have grown
     To deem, as a most logical conclusion,
       That poesy has wreaths for you alone.
     There is a narrowness in such a notion,
     Which makes me wish you'd change your lakes for ocean.

     I would not imitate the petty thought,
       Nor coin my self-love to so base a vice,
     For all the glory your conversion brought,
       Since gold alone should not have been its price.
     You have your salary; was't for that you wrought?
       And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.
     You're shabby fellows--true--but poets still
     And duly seated on the immortal hill.

     Your bays may hide the baldness of your brows,
       Perhaps some virtuous blushes; let them go.
     To you I envy neither fruit nor boughs,
       And for the fame you would engross below,
     The field is universal and allows
       Scope to all such as feel the inherent glow.
     Scott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe will try
     'Gainst you the question with posterity.

     For me, who, wandering with pedestrian Muses,
       Contend not with you on the winged' steed,
     I wish your fate may yield ye, when she chooses,
       The fame you envy and the skill you need.
     And recollect a poet nothing loses
       In giving to his brethren their full meed
     Of merit, and complaint of present days
     Is not the certain path to future praise.

     He that reserves his laurels for posterity
       (Who does not often claim the bright reversion)
     Has generally no great crop to spare it, he
       Being only injured by his own assertion.
     And although here and there some glorious rarity
       Arise like Titan from the sea's immersion,
     The major part of such appellants go
     To--God knows where--for no one else can know.

     If fallen in evil days on evil tongues,
       Milton appealed to the avenger, Time,
     If Time, the avenger, execrates his wrongs
       And makes the word Miltonic mean sublime,
     He deigned not to belie his soul in songs,
       Nor turn his very talent to a crime.
     He did not loathe the sire to laud the son,
     But closed the tyrant-hater he begun.

     Think'st thou, could he, the blind old man, arise
       Like Samuel from the grave to freeze once more
     The blood of monarchs with his prophecies,
        Or be alive again--again all hoar
     With time and trials, and those helpless eyes
       And heartless daughters--worn and pale and poor,
     Would he adore a sultan? He obey
     The intellectual eunuch Castlereagh?

     Cold-blooded, smooth-faced, placid miscreant!
       Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin's gore,
     And thus for wider carnage taught to pant,
       Transferred to gorge upon a sister shore,
     The vulgarest tool that tyranny could want,
       With just enough of talent and no more,
     To lengthen fetters by another fixed
     And offer poison long already mixed.

     An orator of such set trash of phrase,
       Ineffably, legitimately vile,
     That even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,
       Nor foes--all nations--condescend to smile.
     Not even a sprightly blunder's spark can blaze
       From that Ixion grindstone's ceaseless toil,
     That turns and turns to give the world a notion
     Of endless torments and perpetual motion.

     A bungler even in its disgusting trade,
       And botching, patching, leaving still behind
     Something of which its masters are afraid,
       States to be curbed and thoughts to be confined,
     Conspiracy or congress to be made,
       Cobbling at manacles for all mankind,
     A tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,
     With God and man's abhorrence for its gains.

     If we may judge of matter by the mind,
     Emasculated to the marrow, it
     Hath but two objects, how to serve and bind,
     Deeming the chain it wears even men may fit,
     Eutropius of its many masters, blind
     To worth as freedom, wisdom as to wit,
     Fearless, because no feeling dwells in ice;
     Its very courage stagnates to a vice.

     Where shall I turn me not to view its bonds,
       For I will never feel them. Italy,
     Thy late reviving Roman soul desponds
       Beneath the lie this state-thing breathed o'er thee.
     Thy clanking chain and Erin's yet green wounds
       Have voices, tongues to cry aloud for me.
     Europe has slaves, allies, kings, armies still,
     And Southey lives to sing them very ill.

     Meantime, Sir Laureate, I proceed to dedicate
       In honest simple verse this song to you.
     And if in flattering strains I do not predicate,
       'Tis that I still retain my buff and blue;
     My politics as yet are all to educate.
       Apostasy's so fashionable too,
     To keep one creed's a task grown quite
     Herculean Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?




CANTO THE FIRST

     I want a hero: an uncommon want,
       When every year and month sends forth a new one,
     Till, after cloying the gazettes with cant,
       The age discovers he is not the true one;
     Of such as these I should not care to vaunt,
       I 'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan--
     We all have seen him, in the pantomime,
     Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time.

     Vernon, the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,
       Prince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,
     Evil and good, have had their tithe of talk,
       And fill'd their sign posts then, like Wellesley now;
     Each in their turn like Banquo's monarchs stalk,
       Followers of fame, 'nine farrow' of that sow:
     France, too, had Buonaparte and Dumourier
     Recorded in the Moniteur and Courier.

     Barnave, Brissot, Condorcet, Mirabeau,
       Petion, Clootz, Danton, Marat, La Fayette,
     Were French, and famous people, as we know:
       And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,
     Joubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,
       With many of the military set,
     Exceedingly remarkable at times,
     But not at all adapted to my rhymes.

     Nelson was once Britannia's god of war,
       And still should be so, but the tide is turn'd;
     There 's no more to be said of Trafalgar,
       'T is with our hero quietly inurn'd;
     Because the army 's grown more popular,
       At which the naval people are concern'd;
     Besides, the prince is all for the land-service,
     Forgetting Duncan, Nelson, Howe, and Jervis.

     Brave men were living before Agamemnon
       And since, exceeding valorous and sage,
     A good deal like him too, though quite the same none;
       But then they shone not on the poet's page,
     And so have been forgotten:--I condemn none,
       But can't find any in the present age
     Fit for my poem (that is, for my new one);
     So, as I said, I 'll take my friend Don Juan.

     Most epic poets plunge 'in medias res'
       (Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),
     And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,
       What went before--by way of episode,
     While seated after dinner at his ease,
       Beside his mistress in some soft abode,
     Palace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,
     Which serves the happy couple for a tavern.

     That is the usual method, but not mine--
       My way is to begin with the beginning;
     The regularity of my design
       Forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,
     And therefore I shall open with a line
       (Although it cost me half an hour in spinning)
     Narrating somewhat of Don Juan's father,
     And also of his mother, if you 'd rather.

     In Seville was he born, a pleasant city,
       Famous for oranges and women--he
     Who has not seen it will be much to pity,
       So says the proverb--and I quite agree;
     Of all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,
       Cadiz perhaps--but that you soon may see;
     Don Juan's parents lived beside the river,
     A noble stream, and call'd the Guadalquivir.

     His father's name was Jose--Don, of course,--
       A true Hidalgo, free from every stain
     Of Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source
       Through the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;
     A better cavalier ne'er mounted horse,
       Or, being mounted, e'er got down again,
     Than Jose, who begot our hero, who
     Begot--but that 's to come--Well, to renew:

     His mother was a learned lady, famed
       For every branch of every science known
     In every Christian language ever named,
       With virtues equall'd by her wit alone,
     She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,
       And even the good with inward envy groan,
     Finding themselves so very much exceeded
     In their own way by all the things that she did.

     Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart
       All Calderon and greater part of Lope,
     So that if any actor miss'd his part
       She could have served him for the prompter's copy;
     For her Feinagle's were an useless art,
       And he himself obliged to shut up shop--he
     Could never make a memory so fine as
     That which adorn'd the brain of Donna Inez.

     Her favourite science was the mathematical,
       Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,
     Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,
       Her serious sayings darken'd to sublimity;
     In short, in all things she was fairly what I call
       A prodigy--her morning dress was dimity,
     Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,
     And other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.

     She knew the Latin--that is, 'the Lord's prayer,'
       And Greek--the alphabet--I 'm nearly sure;
     She read some French romances here and there,
       Although her mode of speaking was not pure;
     For native Spanish she had no great care,
       At least her conversation was obscure;
     Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,
     As if she deem'd that mystery would ennoble 'em.

     She liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,
       And said there was analogy between 'em;
     She proved it somehow out of sacred song,
       But I must leave the proofs to those who 've seen 'em;
     But this I heard her say, and can't be wrong
       And all may think which way their judgments lean 'em,
     ''T is strange--the Hebrew noun which means "I am,"
     The English always use to govern d--n.'

     Some women use their tongues--she look'd a lecture,
       Each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,
     An all-in-all sufficient self-director,
       Like the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,
     The Law's expounder, and the State's corrector,
       Whose suicide was almost an anomaly--
     One sad example more, that 'All is vanity'
     (The jury brought their verdict in 'Insanity').

     In short, she was a walking calculation,
       Miss Edgeworth's novels stepping from their covers,
     Or Mrs. Trimmer's books on education,
       Or 'Coelebs' Wife' set out in quest of lovers,
     Morality's prim personification,
       In which not Envy's self a flaw discovers;
     To others' share let 'female errors fall,'
     For she had not even one--the worst of all.

     O! she was perfect past all parallel--
       Of any modern female saint's comparison;
     So far above the cunning powers of hell,
       Her guardian angel had given up his garrison;
     Even her minutest motions went as well
       As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:
     In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,
     Save thine 'incomparable oil,' Macassar!

     Perfect she was, but as perfection is
       Insipid in this naughty world of ours,
     Where our first parents never learn'd to kiss
       Till they were exiled from their earlier bowers,
     Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss
       (I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),
     Don Jose, like a lineal son of Eve,
     Went plucking various fruit without her leave.

     He was a mortal of the careless kind,
       With no great love for learning, or the learn'd,
     Who chose to go where'er he had a mind,
       And never dream'd his lady was concern'd;
     The world, as usual, wickedly inclined
       To see a kingdom or a house o'erturn'd,
     Whisper'd he had a mistress, some said two--
     But for domestic quarrels one will do.

     Now Donna Inez had, with all her merit,
       A great opinion of her own good qualities;
     Neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,
       And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;
     But then she had a devil of a spirit,
       And sometimes mix'd up fancies with realities,
     And let few opportunities escape
     Of getting her liege lord into a scrape.

     This was an easy matter with a man
       Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;
     And even the wisest, do the best they can,
       Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,
     That you might 'brain them with their lady's fan;'
       And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,
     And fans turn into falchions in fair hands,
     And why and wherefore no one understands.

     'T is pity learned virgins ever wed
       With persons of no sort of education,
     Or gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,
       Grow tired of scientific conversation:
     I don't choose to say much upon this head,
       I 'm a plain man, and in a single station,
     But--Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,
     Inform us truly, have they not hen-peck'd you all?

     Don Jose and his lady quarrell'd--why,
       Not any of the many could divine,
     Though several thousand people chose to try,
       'T was surely no concern of theirs nor mine;
     I loathe that low vice--curiosity;
       But if there 's anything in which I shine,
     'T is in arranging all my friends' affairs,
     Not having of my own domestic cares.

     And so I interfered, and with the best
       Intentions, but their treatment was not kind;
     I think the foolish people were possess'd,
       For neither of them could I ever find,
     Although their porter afterwards confess'd--
       But that 's no matter, and the worst 's behind,
     For little Juan o'er me threw, down stairs,
     A pail of housemaid's water unawares.

     A little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,
       And mischief-making monkey from his birth;
     His parents ne'er agreed except in doting
       Upon the most unquiet imp on earth;
     Instead of quarrelling, had they been but both in
       Their senses, they 'd have sent young master forth
     To school, or had him soundly whipp'd at home,
     To teach him manners for the time to come.

     Don Jose and the Donna Inez led
       For some time an unhappy sort of life,
     Wishing each other, not divorced, but dead;
       They lived respectably as man and wife,
     Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,
       And gave no outward signs of inward strife,
     Until at length the smother'd fire broke out,
     And put the business past all kind of doubt.

     For Inez call'd some druggists and physicians,
       And tried to prove her loving lord was mad;
     But as he had some lucid intermissions,
       She next decided he was only bad;
     Yet when they ask'd her for her depositions,
       No sort of explanation could be had,
     Save that her duty both to man and God
     Required this conduct--which seem'd very odd.

     She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,
       And open'd certain trunks of books and letters,
     All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;
       And then she had all Seville for abettors,
     Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);
       The hearers of her case became repeaters,
     Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,
     Some for amusement, others for old grudges.

     And then this best and weakest woman bore
       With such serenity her husband's woes,
     Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,
       Who saw their spouses kill'd, and nobly chose
     Never to say a word about them more--
       Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,
     And saw his agonies with such sublimity,
     That all the world exclaim'd, 'What magnanimity!'

     No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,
       Is philosophic in our former friends;
     'T is also pleasant to be deem'd magnanimous,
       The more so in obtaining our own ends;
     And what the lawyers call a 'malus animus'
       Conduct like this by no means comprehends;
     Revenge in person 's certainly no virtue,
     But then 't is not my fault, if others hurt you.

     And if your quarrels should rip up old stories,
       And help them with a lie or two additional,
     I 'm not to blame, as you well know--no more is
       Any one else--they were become traditional;
     Besides, their resurrection aids our glories
       By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:
     And science profits by this resurrection--
     Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.

     Their friends had tried at reconciliation,
       Then their relations, who made matters worse.
     ('T were hard to tell upon a like occasion
       To whom it may be best to have recourse--
     I can't say much for friend or yet relation):
       The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,
     But scarce a fee was paid on either side
     Before, unluckily, Don Jose died.

     He died: and most unluckily, because,
       According to all hints I could collect
     From counsel learned in those kinds of laws
       (Although their talk 's obscure and circumspect),
     His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;
       A thousand pities also with respect
     To public feeling, which on this occasion
     Was manifested in a great sensation.

     But, ah! he died; and buried with him lay
       The public feeling and the lawyers' fees:
     His house was sold, his servants sent away,
       A Jew took one of his two mistresses,
     A priest the other--at least so they say:
       I ask'd the doctors after his disease--
     He died of the slow fever call'd the tertian,
     And left his widow to her own aversion.

     Yet Jose was an honourable man,
       That I must say who knew him very well;
     Therefore his frailties I 'll no further scan
       Indeed there were not many more to tell;
     And if his passions now and then outran
       Discretion, and were not so peaceable
     As Numa's (who was also named Pompilius),
     He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.

     Whate'er might be his worthlessness or worth,
       Poor fellow! he had many things to wound him.
     Let 's own--since it can do no good on earth--
       It was a trying moment that which found him
     Standing alone beside his desolate hearth,
       Where all his household gods lay shiver'd round him:
     No choice was left his feelings or his pride,
     Save death or Doctors' Commons--so he died.

     Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir
       To a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands,
     Which, with a long minority and care,
       Promised to turn out well in proper hands:
     Inez became sole guardian, which was fair,
       And answer'd but to nature's just demands;
     An only son left with an only mother
     Is brought up much more wisely than another.

     Sagest of women, even of widows, she
       Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,
     And worthy of the noblest pedigree
       (His sire was of Castile, his dam from Aragon):
     Then for accomplishments of chivalry,
       In case our lord the king should go to war again,
     He learn'd the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,
     And how to scale a fortress--or a nunnery.

     But that which Donna Inez most desired,
       And saw into herself each day before all
     The learned tutors whom for him she hired,
       Was, that his breeding should be strictly moral;
     Much into all his studies she inquired,
       And so they were submitted first to her, all,
     Arts, sciences, no branch was made a mystery
     To Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.

     The languages, especially the dead,
       The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,
     The arts, at least all such as could be said
       To be the most remote from common use,
     In all these he was much and deeply read;
       But not a page of any thing that 's loose,
     Or hints continuation of the species,
     Was ever suffer'd, lest he should grow vicious.

     His classic studies made a little puzzle,
       Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,
     Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,
       But never put on pantaloons or bodices;
     His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,
       And for their AEneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,
     Were forced to make an odd sort! of apology,
     For Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.

     Ovid 's a rake, as half his verses show him,
       Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,
     Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,
       I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,
     Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn
       Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:
     But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one
     Beginning with 'Formosum Pastor Corydon.'

     Lucretius' irreligion is too strong,
       For early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;
     I can't help thinking Juvenal was wrong,
       Although no doubt his real intent was good,
     For speaking out so plainly in his song,
       So much indeed as to be downright rude;
     And then what proper person can be partial
     To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?

     Juan was taught from out the best edition,
       Expurgated by learned men, who place
     Judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision,
       The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface
     Too much their modest bard by this omission,
       And pitying sore his mutilated case,
     They only add them all in an appendix,
     Which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;

     For there we have them all 'at one fell swoop,'
       Instead of being scatter'd through the Pages;
     They stand forth marshall'd in a handsome troop,
       To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,
     Till some less rigid editor shall stoop
       To call them back into their separate cages,
     Instead of standing staring all together,
     Like garden gods--and not so decent either.

     The Missal too (it was the family Missal)
       Was ornamented in a sort of way
     Which ancient mass-books often are, and this all
       Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,
     Who saw those figures on the margin kiss all,
       Could turn their optics to the text and pray,
     Is more than I know--But Don Juan's mother
     Kept this herself, and gave her son another.

     Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,
       And homilies, and lives of all the saints;
     To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,
       He did not take such studies for restraints;
     But how faith is acquired, and then ensured,
       So well not one of the aforesaid paints
     As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,
     Which make the reader envy his transgressions.

     This, too, was a seal'd book to little Juan--
       I can't but say that his mamma was right,
     If such an education was the true one.
       She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;
     Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,
       You might be sure she was a perfect fright;
     She did this during even her husband's life--
     I recommend as much to every wife.

     Young Juan wax'd in goodliness and grace;
       At six a charming child, and at eleven
     With all the promise of as fine a face
       As e'er to man's maturer growth was given:
     He studied steadily, and grew apace,
       And seem'd, at least, in the right road to heaven,
     For half his days were pass'd at church, the other
     Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.

     At six, I said, he was a charming child,
       At twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;
     Although in infancy a little wild,
       They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy
     His natural spirit not in vain they toil'd,
       At least it seem'd so; and his mother's joy
     Was to declare how sage, and still, and steady,
     Her young philosopher was grown already.

     I had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,
       But what I say is neither here nor there:
     I knew his father well, and have some skill
       In character--but it would not be fair
     From sire to son to augur good or ill:
       He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair--
     But scandal 's my aversion--I protest
     Against all evil speaking, even in jest.

     For my part I say nothing--nothing--but
       This I will say--my reasons are my own--
     That if I had an only son to put
       To school (as God be praised that I have none),
     'T is not with Donna Inez I would shut
       Him up to learn his catechism alone,
     No--no--I 'd send him out betimes to college,
     For there it was I pick'd up my own knowledge.

     For there one learns--'t is not for me to boast,
       Though I acquired--but I pass over that,
     As well as all the Greek I since have lost:
       I say that there 's the place--but 'Verbum sat.'
     I think I pick'd up too, as well as most,
       Knowledge of matters--but no matter what--
     I never married--but, I think, I know
     That sons should not be educated so.

     Young Juan now was sixteen years of age,
       Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seem'd
     Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;
       And everybody but his mother deem'd
     Him almost man; but she flew in a rage
       And bit her lips (for else she might have scream'd)
     If any said so, for to be precocious
     Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.

     Amongst her numerous acquaintance, all
       Selected for discretion and devotion,
     There was the Donna Julia, whom to call
       Pretty were but to give a feeble notion
     Of many charms in her as natural
       As sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean,
     Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid
     (But this last simile is trite and stupid).

     The darkness of her Oriental eye
       Accorded with her Moorish origin
     (Her blood was not all Spanish, by the by;
       In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin);
     When proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,
       Boabdil wept, of Donna Julia's kin
     Some went to Africa, some stay'd in Spain,
     Her great-great-grandmamma chose to remain.

     She married (I forget the pedigree)
       With an Hidalgo, who transmitted down
     His blood less noble than such blood should be;
       At such alliances his sires would frown,
     In that point so precise in each degree
       That they bred in and in, as might be shown,
     Marrying their cousins--nay, their aunts, and nieces,
     Which always spoils the breed, if it increases.

     This heathenish cross restored the breed again,
       Ruin'd its blood, but much improved its flesh;
     For from a root the ugliest in Old Spain
       Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;
     The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:
       But there 's a rumour which I fain would hush,
     'T is said that Donna Julia's grandmamma
     Produced her Don more heirs at love than law.

     However this might be, the race went on
       Improving still through every generation,
     Until it centred in an only son,
       Who left an only daughter; my narration
     May have suggested that this single one
       Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion
     I shall have much to speak about), and she
     Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.

     Her eye (I 'm very fond of handsome eyes)
       Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire
     Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise
       Flash'd an expression more of pride than ire,
     And love than either; and there would arise
       A something in them which was not desire,
     But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul
     Which struggled through and chasten'd down the whole.

     Her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow
       Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;
     Her eyebrow's shape was like th' aerial bow,
       Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,
     Mounting at times to a transparent glow,
       As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,
     Possess'd an air and grace by no means common:
     Her stature tall--I hate a dumpy woman.

     Wedded she was some years, and to a man
       Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;
     And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE
       'T were better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,
     Especially in countries near the sun:
       And now I think on 't, 'mi vien in mente,'
     Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue
     Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.

     'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,
       And all the fault of that indecent sun,
     Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,
       But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,
     That howsoever people fast and pray,
       The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:
     What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,
     Is much more common where the climate 's sultry.

     Happy the nations of the moral North!
       Where all is virtue, and the winter season
     Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth
       ('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);
     Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,
       By laying whate'er sum in mulct they please on
     The lover, who must pay a handsome price,
     Because it is a marketable vice.

     Alfonso was the name of Julia's lord,
       A man well looking for his years, and who
     Was neither much beloved nor yet abhorr'd:
       They lived together, as most people do,
     Suffering each other's foibles by accord,
       And not exactly either one or two;
     Yet he was jealous, though he did not show it,
     For jealousy dislikes the world to know it.

     Julia was--yet I never could see why--
       With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;
     Between their tastes there was small sympathy,
       For not a line had Julia ever penn'd:
     Some people whisper but no doubt they lie,
       For malice still imputes some private end,
     That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso's marriage,
     Forgot with him her very prudent carriage;

     And that still keeping up the old connection,
       Which time had lately render'd much more chaste,
     She took his lady also in affection,
       And certainly this course was much the best:
     She flatter'd Julia with her sage protection,
       And complimented Don Alfonso's taste;
     And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,
     At least she left it a more slender handle.

     I can't tell whether Julia saw the affair
       With other people's eyes, or if her own
     Discoveries made, but none could be aware
       Of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown;
     Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,
       Indifferent from the first or callous grown:
     I 'm really puzzled what to think or say,
     She kept her counsel in so close a way.

     Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,
       Caress'd him often--such a thing might be
     Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,
       When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;
     But I am not so sure I should have smiled
       When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;
     These few short years make wondrous alterations,
     Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.

     Whate'er the cause might be, they had become
       Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,
     Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,
       And much embarrassment in either eye;
     There surely will be little doubt with some
       That Donna Julia knew the reason why,
     But as for Juan, he had no more notion
     Than he who never saw the sea of ocean.

     Yet Julia's very coldness still was kind,
       And tremulously gentle her small hand
     Withdrew itself from his, but left behind
       A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland
     And slight, so very slight, that to the mind
       'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand
     Wrought change with all Armida's fairy art
     Like what this light touch left on Juan's heart.

     And if she met him, though she smiled no more,
       She look'd a sadness sweeter than her smile,
     As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store
       She must not own, but cherish'd more the while
     For that compression in its burning core;
       Even innocence itself has many a wile,
     And will not dare to trust itself with truth,
     And love is taught hypocrisy from youth.

     But passion most dissembles, yet betrays
       Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky
     Foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays
       Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,
     And in whatever aspect it arrays
       Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;
     Coldness or anger, even disdain or hate,
     Are masks it often wears, and still too late.

     Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,
       And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,
     And burning blushes, though for no transgression,
       Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;
     All these are little preludes to possession,
       Of which young passion cannot be bereft,
     And merely tend to show how greatly love is
     Embarrass'd at first starting with a novice.

     Poor Julia's heart was in an awkward state;
       She felt it going, and resolved to make
     The noblest efforts for herself and mate,
       For honour's, pride's, religion's, virtue's sake;
     Her resolutions were most truly great,
       And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:
     She pray'd the Virgin Mary for her grace,
     As being the best judge of a lady's case.

     She vow'd she never would see Juan more,
       And next day paid a visit to his mother,
     And look'd extremely at the opening door,
       Which, by the Virgin's grace, let in another;
     Grateful she was, and yet a little sore--
       Again it opens, it can be no other,
     'T is surely Juan now--No! I 'm afraid
     That night the Virgin was no further pray'd.

     She now determined that a virtuous woman
       Should rather face and overcome temptation,
     That flight was base and dastardly, and no man
       Should ever give her heart the least sensation;
     That is to say, a thought beyond the common
       Preference, that we must feel upon occasion
     For people who are pleasanter than others,
     But then they only seem so many brothers.

     And even if by chance--and who can tell?
       The devil 's so very sly--she should discover
     That all within was not so very well,
       And, if still free, that such or such a lover
     Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell
       Such thoughts, and be the better when they 're over;
     And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:
     I recommend young ladies to make trial.

     And then there are such things as love divine,
       Bright and immaculate, unmix'd and pure,
     Such as the angels think so very fine,
       And matrons who would be no less secure,
     Platonic, perfect, 'just such love as mine;'
       Thus Julia said--and thought so, to be sure;
     And so I 'd have her think, were I the man
     On whom her reveries celestial ran.

     Such love is innocent, and may exist
       Between young persons without any danger.
     A hand may first, and then a lip be kist;
       For my part, to such doings I 'm a stranger,
     But hear these freedoms form the utmost list
       Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:
     If people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,
     But not my fault--I tell them all in time.

     Love, then, but love within its proper limits,
       Was Julia's innocent determination
     In young Don Juan's favour, and to him its
       Exertion might be useful on occasion;
     And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its
       Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion
     He might be taught, by love and her together--
     I really don't know what, nor Julia either.

     Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced
       In mail of proof--her purity of soul--
     She, for the future of her strength convinced.
       And that her honour was a rock, or mole,
     Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed
       With any kind of troublesome control;
     But whether Julia to the task was equal
     Is that which must be mention'd in the sequel.

     Her plan she deem'd both innocent and feasible,
       And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen
     Not scandal's fangs could fix on much that 's seizable,
       Or if they did so, satisfied to mean
     Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable--
       A quiet conscience makes one so serene!
     Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded
     That all the Apostles would have done as they did.

     And if in the mean time her husband died,
       But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross
     Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh'd)
       Never could she survive that common loss;
     But just suppose that moment should betide,
       I only say suppose it--inter nos.
     (This should be entre nous, for Julia thought
     In French, but then the rhyme would go for naught.)

     I only say suppose this supposition:
       Juan being then grown up to man's estate
     Would fully suit a widow of condition,
       Even seven years hence it would not be too late;
     And in the interim (to pursue this vision)
       The mischief, after all, could not be great,
     For he would learn the rudiments of love,
     I mean the seraph way of those above.

     So much for Julia. Now we 'll turn to Juan.
       Poor little fellow! he had no idea
     Of his own case, and never hit the true one;
       In feelings quick as Ovid's Miss Medea,
     He puzzled over what he found a new one,
       But not as yet imagined it could be
     Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,
     Which, with a little patience, might grow charming.

     Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,
       His home deserted for the lonely wood,
     Tormented with a wound he could not know,
       His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:
     I 'm fond myself of solitude or so,
       But then, I beg it may be understood,
     By solitude I mean a sultan's, not
     A hermit's, with a haram for a grot.

     'Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,
       Where transport and security entwine,
     Here is the empire of thy perfect bliss,
       And here thou art a god indeed divine.'
     The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,
       With the exception of the second line,
     For that same twining 'transport and security'
     Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.

     The poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals
       To the good sense and senses of mankind,
     The very thing which every body feels,
       As all have found on trial, or may find,
     That no one likes to be disturb'd at meals
       Or love.--I won't say more about 'entwined'
     Or 'transport,' as we knew all that before,
     But beg 'Security' will bolt the door.

     Young Juan wander'd by the glassy brooks,
       Thinking unutterable things; he threw
     Himself at length within the leafy nooks
       Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;
     There poets find materials for their books,
       And every now and then we read them through,
     So that their plan and prosody are eligible,
     Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.

     He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued
       His self-communion with his own high soul,
     Until his mighty heart, in its great mood,
       Had mitigated part, though not the whole
     Of its disease; he did the best he could
       With things not very subject to control,

     And turn'd, without perceiving his condition,
     Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.

     He thought about himself, and the whole earth
       Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,
     And how the deuce they ever could have birth;
       And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,
     How many miles the moon might have in girth,
       Of air-balloons, and of the many bars
     To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;--
     And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.

     In thoughts like these true wisdom may discern
       Longings sublime, and aspirations high,
     Which some are born with, but the most part learn
       To plague themselves withal, they know not why:
     'T was strange that one so young should thus concern
       His brain about the action of the sky;
     If you think 't was philosophy that this did,
     I can't help thinking puberty assisted.

     He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,
       And heard a voice in all the winds; and then
     He thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,
       And how the goddesses came down to men:
     He miss'd the pathway, he forgot the hours,
       And when he look'd upon his watch again,
     He found how much old Time had been a winner--
     He also found that he had lost his dinner.

     Sometimes he turn'd to gaze upon his book,
       Boscan, or Garcilasso;--by the wind
     Even as the page is rustled while we look,
       So by the poesy of his own mind
     Over the mystic leaf his soul was shook,
       As if 't were one whereon magicians bind
     Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,
     According to some good old woman's tale.

     Thus would he while his lonely hours away
       Dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;
     Nor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay,
       Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,
     A bosom whereon he his head might lay,
       And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,
     With--several other things, which I forget,
     Or which, at least, I need not mention yet.

     Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,
       Could not escape the gentle Julia's eyes;
     She saw that Juan was not at his ease;
       But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,
     Is, that the Donna Inez did not tease
       Her only son with question or surmise:
     Whether it was she did not see, or would not,
     Or, like all very clever people, could not.

     This may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;
       For instance--gentlemen, whose ladies take
     Leave to o'erstep the written rights of woman,
       And break the--Which commandment is 't they break?
     (I have forgot the number, and think no man
       Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.)
     I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,
     They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.

     A real husband always is suspicious,
       But still no less suspects in the wrong place,
     Jealous of some one who had no such wishes,
       Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace,
     By harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;
       The last indeed 's infallibly the case:
     And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,
     He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.

     Thus parents also are at times short-sighted;
       Though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover,
     The while the wicked world beholds delighted,
       Young Hopeful's mistress, or Miss Fanny's lover,
     Till some confounded escapade has blighted
       The plan of twenty years, and all is over;
     And then the mother cries, the father swears,
     And wonders why the devil he got heirs.

     But Inez was so anxious, and so clear
       Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,
     She had some other motive much more near
       For leaving Juan to this new temptation;
     But what that motive was, I sha'n't say here;
       Perhaps to finish Juan's education,
     Perhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,
     In case he thought his wife too great a prize.

     It was upon a day, a summer's day;-
       Summer's indeed a very dangerous season,
     And so is spring about the end of May;
       The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;
     But whatsoe'er the cause is, one may say,
       And stand convicted of more truth than treason,
     That there are months which nature grows more merry in,--
     March has its hares, and May must have its heroine.

     'T was on a summer's day--the sixth of June:--
       I like to be particular in dates,
     Not only of the age, and year, but moon;
       They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates
     Change horses, making history change its tune,
       Then spur away o'er empires and o'er states,
     Leaving at last not much besides chronology,
     Excepting the post-obits of theology.

     'T was on the sixth of June, about the hour
       Of half-past six--perhaps still nearer seven--
     When Julia sate within as pretty a bower
       As e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven
     Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,
       To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,
     With all the trophies of triumphant song--
     He won them well, and may he wear them long!

     She sate, but not alone; I know not well
       How this same interview had taken place,
     And even if I knew, I should not tell--
       People should hold their tongues in any case;
     No matter how or why the thing befell,
       But there were she and Juan, face to face--
     When two such faces are so, 't would be wise,
     But very difficult, to shut their eyes.

     How beautiful she look'd! her conscious heart
       Glow'd in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong.
     O Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,
       Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong,
     How self-deceitful is the sagest part
       Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along--
     The precipice she stood on was immense,
     So was her creed in her own innocence.

     She thought of her own strength, and Juan's youth,
       And of the folly of all prudish fears,
     Victorious virtue, and domestic truth,
       And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:
     I wish these last had not occurr'd, in sooth,
       Because that number rarely much endears,
     And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,
     Sounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money.

     When people say, 'I've told you fifty times,'
       They mean to scold, and very often do;
     When poets say, 'I've written fifty rhymes,'
       They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;
     In gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;
       At fifty love for love is rare, 't is true,
     But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,
     A good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.

     Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love,
       For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,
     By all the vows below to powers above,
       She never would disgrace the ring she wore,
     Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;
       And while she ponder'd this, besides much more,
     One hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,
     Quite by mistake--she thought it was her own;

     Unconsciously she lean'd upon the other,
       Which play'd within the tangles of her hair:
     And to contend with thoughts she could not smother
       She seem'd by the distraction of her air.
     'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother
       To leave together this imprudent pair,
     She who for many years had watch'd her son so--
     I 'm very certain mine would not have done so.

     The hand which still held Juan's, by degrees
       Gently, but palpably confirm'd its grasp,
     As if it said, 'Detain me, if you please;'
       Yet there 's no doubt she only meant to clasp
     His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze:
       She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,
     Had she imagined such a thing could rouse
     A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.

     I cannot know what Juan thought of this,
       But what he did, is much what you would do;
     His young lip thank'd it with a grateful kiss,
       And then, abash'd at its own joy, withdrew
     In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,--
       Love is so very timid when 't is new:
     She blush'd, and frown'd not, but she strove to speak,
     And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.

     The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:
       The devil 's in the moon for mischief; they
     Who call'd her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon
       Their nomenclature; there is not a day,
     The longest, not the twenty-first of June,
       Sees half the business in a wicked way
     On which three single hours of moonshine smile--
     And then she looks so modest all the while.

     There is a dangerous silence in that hour,
       A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul
     To open all itself, without the power
       Of calling wholly back its self-control;
     The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,
       Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,
     Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws
     A loving languor, which is not repose.

     And Julia sate with Juan, half embraced
       And half retiring from the glowing arm,
     Which trembled like the bosom where 't was placed;
       Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,
     Or else 't were easy to withdraw her waist;
       But then the situation had its charm,
     And then--God knows what next--I can't go on;
     I 'm almost sorry that I e'er begun.

     O Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,
       With your confounded fantasies, to more
     Immoral conduct by the fancied sway
       Your system feigns o'er the controulless core
     Of human hearts, than all the long array
       Of poets and romancers:--You 're a bore,
     A charlatan, a coxcomb--and have been,
     At best, no better than a go-between.

     And Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,
       Until too late for useful conversation;
     The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,
       I wish indeed they had not had occasion,
     But who, alas! can love, and then be wise?
       Not that remorse did not oppose temptation;
     A little still she strove, and much repented
     And whispering 'I will ne'er consent'--consented.

     'T is said that Xerxes offer'd a reward
       To those who could invent him a new pleasure:
     Methinks the requisition 's rather hard,
       And must have cost his majesty a treasure:
     For my part, I 'm a moderate-minded bard,
       Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);
     I care not for new pleasures, as the old
     Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.

     O Pleasure! you are indeed a pleasant thing,
       Although one must be damn'd for you, no doubt:
     I make a resolution every spring
       Of reformation, ere the year run out,
     But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,
       Yet still, I trust it may be kept throughout:
     I 'm very sorry, very much ashamed,
     And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim'd.

     Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take--
       Start not! still chaster reader--she 'll be nice hence--
     Forward, and there is no great cause to quake;
       This liberty is a poetic licence,
     Which some irregularity may make
       In the design, and as I have a high sense
     Of Aristotle and the Rules, 't is fit
     To beg his pardon when I err a bit.

     This licence is to hope the reader will
       Suppose from June the sixth (the fatal day,
     Without whose epoch my poetic skill
       For want of facts would all be thrown away),
     But keeping Julia and Don Juan still
       In sight, that several months have pass'd; we 'll say
     'T was in November, but I 'm not so sure
     About the day--the era 's more obscure.

     We 'll talk of that anon.--'T is sweet to hear
       At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep
     The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,
       By distance mellow'd, o'er the waters sweep;
     'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;
       'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep
     From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high
     The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.

     'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark
       Bay deep-mouth'd welcome as we draw near home;
     'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark
       Our coming, and look brighter when we come;
     'T is sweet to be awaken'd by the lark,
       Or lull'd by falling waters; sweet the hum
     Of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,
     The lisp of children, and their earliest words.

     Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes
       In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,
     Purple and gushing: sweet are our escapes
       From civic revelry to rural mirth;
     Sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,
       Sweet to the father is his first-born's birth,
     Sweet is revenge--especially to women,
     Pillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.

     Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet
       The unexpected death of some old lady
     Or gentleman of seventy years complete,
       Who 've made 'us youth' wait too--too long already
     For an estate, or cash, or country seat,
       Still breaking, but with stamina so steady
     That all the Israelites are fit to mob its
     Next owner for their double-damn'd post-obits.

     'T is sweet to win, no matter how, one's laurels,
       By blood or ink; 't is sweet to put an end
     To strife; 't is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels,
       Particularly with a tiresome friend:
     Sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;
       Dear is the helpless creature we defend
     Against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot
     We ne'er forget, though there we are forgot.

     But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,
       Is first and passionate love--it stands alone,
     Like Adam's recollection of his fall;
       The tree of knowledge has been pluck'd--all 's known--
     And life yields nothing further to recall
       Worthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown,
     No doubt in fable, as the unforgiven
     Fire which Prometheus filch'd for us from heaven.

     Man 's a strange animal, and makes strange use
       Of his own nature, and the various arts,
     And likes particularly to produce
       Some new experiment to show his parts;
     This is the age of oddities let loose,
       Where different talents find their different marts;
     You 'd best begin with truth, and when you 've lost your
     Labour, there 's a sure market for imposture.

     What opposite discoveries we have seen!
       (Signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.)
     One makes new noses, one a guillotine,
       One breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;
     But vaccination certainly has been
       A kind antithesis to Congreve's rockets,
     With which the Doctor paid off an old pox,
     By borrowing a new one from an ox.

     Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;
       And galvanism has set some corpses grinning,
     But has not answer'd like the apparatus
       Of the Humane Society's beginning
     By which men are unsuffocated gratis:
       What wondrous new machines have late been spinning!
     I said the small-pox has gone out of late;
     Perhaps it may be follow'd by the great.

     'T is said the great came from America;
       Perhaps it may set out on its return,--
     The population there so spreads, they say
       'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,
     With war, or plague, or famine, any way,
       So that civilisation they may learn;
     And which in ravage the more loathsome evil is--
     Their real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?

     This is the patent-age of new inventions
       For killing bodies, and for saving souls,
     All propagated with the best intentions;
       Sir Humphry Davy's lantern, by which coals
     Are safely mined for in the mode he mentions,
       Tombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles,
     Are ways to benefit mankind, as true,
     Perhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.

     Man 's a phenomenon, one knows not what,
       And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;
     'T is pity though, in this sublime world, that
       Pleasure 's a sin, and sometimes sin 's a pleasure;
     Few mortals know what end they would be at,
       But whether glory, power, or love, or treasure,
     The path is through perplexing ways, and when
     The goal is gain'd, we die, you know--and then--

     What then?--I do not know, no more do you--
       And so good night.--Return we to our story:
     'T was in November, when fine days are few,
       And the far mountains wax a little hoary,
     And clap a white cape on their mantles blue;
       And the sea dashes round the promontory,
     And the loud breaker boils against the rock,
     And sober suns must set at five o'clock.

     'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;
       No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud
     By gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright
       With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;
     There 's something cheerful in that sort of light,
       Even as a summer sky 's without a cloud:
     I 'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,
     A lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.

     'T was midnight--Donna Julia was in bed,
       Sleeping, most probably,--when at her door
     Arose a clatter might awake the dead,
       If they had never been awoke before,
     And that they have been so we all have read,
       And are to be so, at the least, once more;--
     The door was fasten'd, but with voice and fist
     First knocks were heard, then 'Madam--Madam--hist!

     'For God's sake, Madam--Madam--here 's my master,
       With more than half the city at his back--
     Was ever heard of such a curst disaster!
       'T is not my fault--I kept good watch--Alack!
     Do pray undo the bolt a little faster--
       They 're on the stair just now, and in a crack
     Will all be here; perhaps he yet may fly--
     Surely the window 's not so very high!'

     By this time Don Alfonso was arrived,
       With torches, friends, and servants in great number;
     The major part of them had long been wived,
       And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber
     Of any wicked woman, who contrived
       By stealth her husband's temples to encumber:
     Examples of this kind are so contagious,
     Were one not punish'd, all would be outrageous.

     I can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion
       Could enter into Don Alfonso's head;
     But for a cavalier of his condition
       It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,
     Without a word of previous admonition,
       To hold a levee round his lady's bed,
     And summon lackeys, arm'd with fire and sword,
     To prove himself the thing he most abhorr'd.

     Poor Donna Julia, starting as from sleep
       (Mind--that I do not say--she had not slept),
     Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;
       Her maid Antonia, who was an adept,
     Contrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,
       As if she had just now from out them crept:
     I can't tell why she should take all this trouble
     To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.

     But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,
       Appear'd like two poor harmless women, who
     Of goblins, but still more of men afraid,
       Had thought one man might be deterr'd by two,
     And therefore side by side were gently laid,
       Until the hours of absence should run through,
     And truant husband should return, and say,
     'My dear, I was the first who came away.'

     Now Julia found at length a voice, and cried,
       'In heaven's name, Don Alfonso, what d' ye mean?
     Has madness seized you? would that I had died
       Ere such a monster's victim I had been!
     What may this midnight violence betide,
       A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?
     Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?
     Search, then, the room!'--Alfonso said, 'I will.'

     He search'd, they search'd, and rummaged everywhere,
       Closet and clothes' press, chest and window-seat,
     And found much linen, lace, and several pair
       Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,
     With other articles of ladies fair,
       To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:
     Arras they prick'd and curtains with their swords,
     And wounded several shutters, and some boards.

     Under the bed they search'd, and there they found--
       No matter what--it was not that they sought;
     They open'd windows, gazing if the ground
       Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;
     And then they stared each other's faces round:
       'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,
     And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,
     Of looking in the bed as well as under.

     During this inquisition, Julia's tongue
       Was not asleep--'Yes, search and search,' she cried,
     'Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!
       It was for this that I became a bride!
     For this in silence I have suffer'd long
       A husband like Alfonso at my side;
     But now I 'll bear no more, nor here remain,
     If there be law or lawyers in all Spain.

     'Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,
       If ever you indeed deserved the name,
     Is 't worthy of your years?--you have threescore--
       Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same--
     Is 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore
       For facts against a virtuous woman's fame?
     Ungrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,
     How dare you think your lady would go on so?

     'Is it for this I have disdain'd to hold
       The common privileges of my sex?
     That I have chosen a confessor so old
       And deaf, that any other it would vex,
     And never once he has had cause to scold,
       But found my very innocence perplex
     So much, he always doubted I was married--
     How sorry you will be when I 've miscarried!

     'Was it for this that no Cortejo e'er
       I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?
     Is it for this I scarce went anywhere,
       Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?
     Is it for this, whate'er my suitors were,
       I favor'd none--nay, was almost uncivil?
     Is it for this that General Count O'Reilly,
     Who took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?

     'Did not the Italian Musico Cazzani
       Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?
     Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,
       Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?
     Were there not also Russians, English, many?
       The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,
     And Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,
     Who kill'd himself for love (with wine) last year.

     'Have I not had two bishops at my feet,
       The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez?
     And is it thus a faithful wife you treat?
       I wonder in what quarter now the moon is:
     I praise your vast forbearance not to beat
       Me also, since the time so opportune is--
     O, valiant man! with sword drawn and cock'd trigger,
     Now, tell me, don't you cut a pretty figure?

     'Was it for this you took your sudden journey.
       Under pretence of business indispensable
     With that sublime of rascals your attorney,
       Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible
     Of having play'd the fool? though both I spurn, he
       Deserves the worst, his conduct 's less defensible,
     Because, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee,
     And not from any love to you nor me.

     'If he comes here to take a deposition,
       By all means let the gentleman proceed;
     You 've made the apartment in a fit condition:
       There 's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need--
     Let every thing be noted with precision,
       I would not you for nothing should be fee'd--
     But, as my maid 's undrest, pray turn your spies out.'
     'Oh!' sobb'd Antonia, 'I could tear their eyes out.'

     'There is the closet, there the toilet, there
       The antechamber--search them under, over;
     There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,
       The chimney--which would really hold a lover.
     I wish to sleep, and beg you will take care
       And make no further noise, till you discover
     The secret cavern of this lurking treasure--
     And when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.

     'And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown
       Doubt upon me, confusion over all,
     Pray have the courtesy to make it known
       Who is the man you search for? how d' ye cal
     Him? what 's his lineage? let him but be shown--
       I hope he 's young and handsome--is he tall?
     Tell me--and be assured, that since you stain
     My honour thus, it shall not be in vain.

     'At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,
       At that age he would be too old for slaughter,
     Or for so young a husband's jealous fears
       (Antonia! let me have a glass of water).
     I am ashamed of having shed these tears,
       They are unworthy of my father's daughter;
     My mother dream'd not in my natal hour
     That I should fall into a monster's power.

     'Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,
       You saw that she was sleeping by my side
     When you broke in upon us with your fellows:
       Look where you please--we 've nothing, sir, to hide;
     Only another time, I trust, you 'll tell us,
       Or for the sake of decency abide
     A moment at the door, that we may be
     Drest to receive so much good company.

     'And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;
       The little I have said may serve to show
     The guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er
       The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:
     I leave you to your conscience as before,
       'T will one day ask you why you used me so?
     God grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!-
     Antonia! where 's my pocket-handkerchief?'

     She ceased, and turn'd upon her pillow; pale
       She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,
     Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,
       Waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears
     Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail,
       To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears
     Its snow through all;--her soft lips lie apart,
     And louder than her breathing beats her heart.

     The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;
       Antonia bustled round the ransack'd room,
     And, turning up her nose, with looks abused
       Her master and his myrmidons, of whom
     Not one, except the attorney, was amused;
       He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,
     So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,
     Knowing they must be settled by the laws.

     With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,
       Following Antonia's motions here and there,
     With much suspicion in his attitude;
       For reputations he had little care;
     So that a suit or action were made good,
       Small pity had he for the young and fair,
     And ne'er believed in negatives, till these
     Were proved by competent false witnesses.

     But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,
       And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;
     When, after searching in five hundred nooks,
       And treating a young wife with so much rigour,
     He gain'd no point, except some self-rebukes,
       Added to those his lady with such vigour
     Had pour'd upon him for the last half-hour,
     Quick, thick, and heavy--as a thunder-shower.

     At first he tried to hammer an excuse,
       To which the sole reply was tears and sobs,
     And indications of hysterics, whose
       Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,
     Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose:
       Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;
     He saw too, in perspective, her relations,
     And then he tried to muster all his patience.

     He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,
       But sage Antonia cut him short before
     The anvil of his speech received the hammer,
       With 'Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,
     Or madam dies.'--Alfonso mutter'd, 'D--n her,'
       But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;
     He cast a rueful look or two, and did,
     He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.

     With him retired his 'posse comitatus,'
       The attorney last, who linger'd near the door
     Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as
       Antonia let him--not a little sore
     At this most strange and unexplain'd 'hiatus'
       In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore
     An awkward look; as he revolved the case,
     The door was fasten'd in his legal face.

     No sooner was it bolted, than--Oh shame!
       O sin! Oh sorrow! and oh womankind!
     How can you do such things and keep your fame,
       Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?
     Nothing so dear as an unfilch'd good name!
       But to proceed--for there is more behind:
     With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,
     Young Juan slipp'd half-smother'd, from the bed.

     He had been hid--I don't pretend to say
       How, nor can I indeed describe the where--
     Young, slender, and pack'd easily, he lay,
       No doubt, in little compass, round or square;
     But pity him I neither must nor may
       His suffocation by that pretty pair;
     'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut
     With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.

     And, secondly, I pity not, because
       He had no business to commit a sin,
     Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws,
       At least 't was rather early to begin;
     But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws
       So much as when we call our old debts in
     At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,
     And find a deuced balance with the devil.

     Of his position I can give no notion:
       'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,
     How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,
       Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,
     When old King David's blood grew dull in motion,
       And that the medicine answer'd very well;
     Perhaps 't was in a different way applied,
     For David lived, but Juan nearly died.

     What 's to be done? Alfonso will be back
       The moment he has sent his fools away.
     Antonia's skill was put upon the rack,
       But no device could be brought into play--
     And how to parry the renew'd attack?
       Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:
     Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,
     But press'd her bloodless lip to Juan's cheek.

     He turn'd his lip to hers, and with his hand
       Call'd back the tangles of her wandering hair;
     Even then their love they could not all command,
       And half forgot their danger and despair:
     Antonia's patience now was at a stand--
       'Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,'
     She whisper'd, in great wrath--'I must deposit
     This pretty gentleman within the closet:

     'Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night--
       Who can have put my master in this mood?
     What will become on 't--I 'm in such a fright,
       The devil 's in the urchin, and no good--
     Is this a time for giggling? this a plight?
       Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?
     You 'll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,
     My mistress all, for that half-girlish face.

     'Had it but been for a stout cavalier
       Of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)--
     But for a child, what piece of work is here!
       I really, madam, wonder at your taste
     (Come, sir, get in)--my master must be near:
       There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,
     And if we can but till the morning keep
     Our counsel--(Juan, mind, you must not sleep).'

     Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,
       Closed the oration of the trusty maid:
     She loiter'd, and he told her to be gone,
       An order somewhat sullenly obey'd;
     However, present remedy was none,
       And no great good seem'd answer'd if she stay'd:
     Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,
     She snuff'd the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.

     Alfonso paused a minute--then begun
       Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;
     He would not justify what he had done,
       To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;
     But there were ample reasons for it, none
       Of which he specified in this his pleading:
     His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,
     Of rhetoric, which the learn'd call 'rigmarole.'

     Julia said nought; though all the while there rose
       A ready answer, which at once enables
     A matron, who her husband's foible knows,
       By a few timely words to turn the tables,
     Which, if it does not silence, still must pose,--
       Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;
     'T is to retort with firmness, and when he
     Suspects with one, do you reproach with three.

     Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,--
       Alfonso's loves with Inez were well known,
     But whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds--
       But that can't be, as has been often shown,
     A lady with apologies abounds;--
       It might be that her silence sprang alone
     From delicacy to Don Juan's ear,
     To whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.

     There might be one more motive, which makes two;
       Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,--
     Mention'd his jealousy but never who
       Had been the happy lover, he concluded,
     Conceal'd amongst his premises; 't is true,
       His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;
     To speak of Inez now were, one may say,
     Like throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.

     A hint, in tender cases, is enough;
       Silence is best, besides there is a tact
     (That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,
       But it will serve to keep my verse compact)-
     Which keeps, when push'd by questions rather rough,
       A lady always distant from the fact:
     The charming creatures lie with such a grace,
     There 's nothing so becoming to the face.

     They blush, and we believe them; at least I
       Have always done so; 't is of no great use,
     In any case, attempting a reply,
       For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;
     And when at length they 're out of breath, they sigh,
       And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose
     A tear or two, and then we make it up;
     And then--and then--and then--sit down and sup.

     Alfonso closed his speech, and begg'd her pardon,
       Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,
     And laid conditions he thought very hard on,
       Denying several little things he wanted:
     He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,
       With useless penitence perplex'd and haunted,
     Beseeching she no further would refuse,
     When, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes.

     A pair of shoes!--what then? not much, if they
       Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these
     (No one can tell how much I grieve to say)
       Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,
     Was but a moment's act.--Ah! well-a-day!
       My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze--
     Alfonso first examined well their fashion,
     And then flew out into another passion.

     He left the room for his relinquish'd sword,
       And Julia instant to the closet flew.
     'Fly, Juan, fly! for heaven's sake--not a word--
       The door is open--you may yet slip through
     The passage you so often have explored--
       Here is the garden-key--Fly--fly--Adieu!
     Haste--haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet--
     Day has not broke--there 's no one in the street:

     None can say that this was not good advice,
       The only mischief was, it came too late;
     Of all experience 't is the usual price,
       A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:
     Juan had reach'd the room-door in a. trice,
       And might have done so by the garden-gate,
     But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,
     Who threaten'd death--so Juan knock'd him down.

     Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;
       Antonia cried out 'Rape!' and Julia 'Fire!'
     But not a servant stirr'd to aid the fight.
       Alfonso, pommell'd to his heart's desire,
     Swore lustily he'd be revenged this night;
       And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;
     His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,
     And not at all disposed to prove a martyr.

     Alfonso's sword had dropp'd ere he could draw it,
       And they continued battling hand to hand,
     For Juan very luckily ne'er saw it;
       His temper not being under great command,
     If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,
       Alfonso's days had not been in the land
     Much longer.--Think of husbands', lovers' lives!
     And how ye may be doubly widows--wives!

     Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,
       And Juan throttled him to get away,
     And blood ('t was from the nose) began to flow;
       At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,
     Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,
       And then his only garment quite gave way;
     He fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,
     I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.

     Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found
       An awkward spectacle their eyes before;
     Antonia in hysterics, Julia swoon'd,
       Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;
     Some half-torn drapery scatter'd on the ground,
       Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:
     Juan the gate gain'd, turn'd the key about,
     And liking not the inside, lock'd the out.

     Here ends this canto.--Need I sing, or say,
       How Juan naked, favour'd by the night,
     Who favours what she should not, found his way,
       And reach'd his home in an unseemly plight?
     The pleasant scandal which arose next day,
       The nine days' wonder which was brought to light,
     And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,
     Were in the English newspapers, of course.

     If you would like to see the whole proceedings,
       The depositions, and the cause at full,
     The names of all the witnesses, the pleadings
       Of counsel to nonsuit, or to annul,
     There 's more than one edition, and the readings
       Are various, but they none of them are dull;
     The best is that in short-hand ta'en by Gurney,
     Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey.

     But Donna Inez, to divert the train
       Of one of the most circulating scandals
     That had for centuries been known in Spain,
       At least since the retirement of the Vandals,
     First vow'd (and never had she vow'd in vain)
       To Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;
     And then, by the advice of some old ladies,
     She sent her son to be shipp'd off from Cadiz.

     She had resolved that he should travel through
       All European climes, by land or sea,
     To mend his former morals, and get new,
       Especially in France and Italy
     (At least this is the thing most people do).
       Julia was sent into a convent: she
     Grieved, but, perhaps, her feelings may be better
     Shown in the following copy of her Letter:--

     'They tell me 't is decided; you depart:
       'T is wise--'t is well, but not the less a pain;
     I have no further claim on your young heart,
       Mine is the victim, and would be again;
     To love too much has been the only art
       I used;--I write in haste, and if a stain
     Be on this sheet, 't is not what it appears;
     My eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.

     'I loved, I love you, for this love have lost
       State, station, heaven, mankind's, my own esteem,
     And yet can not regret what it hath cost,
       So dear is still the memory of that dream;
     Yet, if I name my guilt, 't is not to boast,
       None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:
     I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest--
     I 've nothing to reproach, or to request.

     'Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,
       'T is woman's whole existence; man may range
     The court, camp, church, the vessel, and the mart;
       Sword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange
     Pride, fame, ambition, to fill up his heart,
       And few there are whom these cannot estrange;
     Men have all these resources, we but one,
     To love again, and be again undone.

     'You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,
       Beloved and loving many; all is o'er
     For me on earth, except some years to hide
       My shame and sorrow deep in my heart's core;
     These I could bear, but cannot cast aside
       The passion which still rages as before--
     And so farewell--forgive me, love me--No,
     That word is idle now--but let it go.

     'My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;
       But still I think I can collect my mind;
     My blood still rushes where my spirit 's set,
       As roll the waves before the settled wind;
     My heart is feminine, nor can forget--
       To all, except one image, madly blind;
     So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,
     As vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul.

     'I have no more to say, but linger still,
       And dare not set my seal upon this sheet,
     And yet I may as well the task fulfil,
       My misery can scarce be more complete:
     I had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;
       Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,
     And I must even survive this last adieu,
     And bear with life, to love and pray for you!'

     This note was written upon gilt-edged paper
       With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new:
     Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,
       It trembled as magnetic needles do,
     And yet she did not let one tear escape her;
       The seal a sun-flower; 'Elle vous suit partout,'
     The motto cut upon a white cornelian;
     The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.

     This was Don Juan's earliest scrape; but whether
       I shall proceed with his adventures is
     Dependent on the public altogether;
       We 'll see, however, what they say to this:
     Their favour in an author's cap 's a feather,
       And no great mischief 's done by their caprice;
     And if their approbation we experience,
     Perhaps they 'll have some more about a year hence.

     My poem 's epic, and is meant to be
       Divided in twelve books; each book containing,
     With love, and war, a heavy gale at sea,
       A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,
     New characters; the episodes are three:
       A panoramic view of hell 's in training,
     After the style of Virgil and of Homer,
     So that my name of Epic 's no misnomer.

     All these things will be specified in time,
       With strict regard to Aristotle's rules,
     The Vade Mecum of the true sublime,
       Which makes so many poets, and some fools:
     Prose poets like blank-verse, I 'm fond of rhyme,
       Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;
     I 've got new mythological machinery,
     And very handsome supernatural scenery.

     There 's only one slight difference between
       Me and my epic brethren gone before,
     And here the advantage is my own, I ween
       (Not that I have not several merits more,
     But this will more peculiarly be seen);
       They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore
     Their labyrinth of fables to thread through,
     Whereas this story 's actually true.

     If any person doubt it, I appeal
       To history, tradition, and to facts,
     To newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,
       To plays in five, and operas in three acts;
     All these confirm my statement a good deal,
       But that which more completely faith exacts
     Is that myself, and several now in Seville,
     Saw Juan's last elopement with the devil.

     If ever I should condescend to prose,
       I 'll write poetical commandments, which
     Shall supersede beyond all doubt all those
       That went before; in these I shall enrich
     My text with many things that no one knows,
       And carry precept to the highest pitch:
     I 'll call the work 'Longinus o'er a Bottle,
     Or, Every Poet his own Aristotle.'

     Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;
       Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;
     Because the first is crazed beyond all hope,
       The second drunk, the third so quaint and mouthy:
     With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,
       And Campbell's Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:
     Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor
     Commit--flirtation with the muse of Moore.

     Thou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby's Muse,
       His Pegasus, nor anything that 's his;
     Thou shalt not bear false witness like 'the Blues'
       (There 's one, at least, is very fond of this);
     Thou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:
       This is true criticism, and you may kiss--
     Exactly as you please, or not,--the rod;

     If any person should presume to assert
       This story is not moral, first, I pray,
     That they will not cry out before they 're hurt,
       Then that they 'll read it o'er again, and say
     (But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)
       That this is not a moral tale, though gay;
     Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show
     The very place where wicked people go.

     If, after all, there should be some so blind
       To their own good this warning to despise,
     Led by some tortuosity of mind,
       Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,
     And cry that they 'the moral cannot find,'
       I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;
     Should captains the remark, or critics, make,
     They also lie too--under a mistake.

     The public approbation I expect,
       And beg they 'll take my word about the moral,
     Which I with their amusement will connect
       (So children cutting teeth receive a coral);
     Meantime, they 'll doubtless please to recollect
       My epical pretensions to the laurel:
     For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,
     I 've bribed my grandmother's review--the British.

     I sent it in a letter to the Editor,
       Who thank'd me duly by return of post--
     I 'm for a handsome article his creditor;
       Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,
     And break a promise after having made it her,
       Denying the receipt of what it cost,
     And smear his page with gall instead of honey,
     All I can say is--that he had the money.

     I think that with this holy new alliance
       I may ensure the public, and defy
     All other magazines of art or science,
       Daily, or monthly, or three monthly; I
     Have not essay'd to multiply their clients,
       Because they tell me 't were in vain to try,
     And that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly
     Treat a dissenting author very martyrly.

     'Non ego hoc ferrem calida juventa
       Consule Planco,' Horace said, and so
     Say I; by which quotation there is meant a
       Hint that some six or seven good years ago
     (Long ere I dreamt of dating from the Brenta)
       I was most ready to return a blow,
     And would not brook at all this sort of thing
     In my hot youth--when George the Third was King.

     But now at thirty years my hair is grey
       (I wonder what it will be like at forty?
     I thought of a peruke the other day)--
       My heart is not much greener; and, in short, I
     Have squander'd my whole summer while 't was May,
       And feel no more the spirit to retort; I
     Have spent my life, both interest and principal,
     And deem not, what I deem'd, my soul invincible.

     No more--no more--Oh! never more on me
       The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,
     Which out of all the lovely things we see
       Extracts emotions beautiful and new,
     Hived in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee:
       Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?
     Alas! 't was not in them, but in thy power
     To double even the sweetness of a flower.

     No more--no more--Oh! never more, my heart,
       Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!
     Once all in all, but now a thing apart,
       Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:
     The illusion 's gone for ever, and thou art
       Insensible, I trust, but none the worse,
     And in thy stead I 've got a deal of judgment,
     Though heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.

     My days of love are over; me no more
       The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,
     Can make the fool of which they made before,--
       In short, I must not lead the life I did do;
     The credulous hope of mutual minds is o'er,
       The copious use of claret is forbid too,
     So for a good old-gentlemanly vice,
     I think I must take up with avarice.

     Ambition was my idol, which was broken
       Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;
     And the two last have left me many a token
       O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:
     Now, like Friar Bacon's brazen head, I 've spoken,
       'Time is, Time was, Time 's past:'--a chymic treasure
     Is glittering youth, which I have spent betimes--
     My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.

     What is the end of Fame? 't is but to fill
       A certain portion of uncertain paper:
     Some liken it to climbing up a hill,
       Whose summit, like all hills, is lost in vapour;
     For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,
       And bards burn what they call their 'midnight taper,'
     To have, when the original is dust,
     A name, a wretched picture, and worse bust.

     What are the hopes of man? Old Egypt's King
       Cheops erected the first pyramid
     And largest, thinking it was just the thing
       To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;
     But somebody or other rummaging,
       Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
     Let not a monument give you or me hopes,
     Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.

     But I being fond of true philosophy,
       Say very often to myself, 'Alas!
     All things that have been born were born to die,
       And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;
     You 've pass'd your youth not so unpleasantly,
       And if you had it o'er again--'t would pass--
     So thank your stars that matters are no worse,
     And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.'

     But for the present, gentle reader! and
       Still gentler purchaser! the bard--that 's I--
     Must, with permission, shake you by the hand,
       And so 'Your humble servant, and good-b'ye!'
     We meet again, if we should understand
       Each other; and if not, I shall not try
     Your patience further than by this short sample--
     'T were well if others follow'd my example.

     'Go, little book, from this my solitude!
       I cast thee on the waters--go thy ways!
     And if, as I believe, thy vein be good,
       The world will find thee after many days.'
     When Southey's read, and Wordsworth understood,
       I can't help putting in my claim to praise--
     The four first rhymes are Southey's every line:
     For God's sake, reader! take them not for mine.


[Illustration: Canto 2]




CANTO THE SECOND.

     O ye! who teach the ingenuous youth of nations,
       Holland, France, England, Germany, or Spain,
     I pray ye flog them upon all occasions,
       It mends their morals, never mind the pain:
     The best of mothers and of educations
       In Juan's case were but employ'd in vain,
     Since, in a way that 's rather of the oddest, he
     Became divested of his native modesty.

     Had he but been placed at a public school,
       In the third form, or even in the fourth,
     His daily task had kept his fancy cool,
       At least, had he been nurtured in the north;
     Spain may prove an exception to the rule,
       But then exceptions always prove its worth--
     A lad of sixteen causing a divorce
     Puzzled his tutors very much, of course.

     I can't say that it puzzles me at all,
       If all things be consider'd: first, there was
     His lady--mother, mathematical,
       A--never mind; his tutor, an old ass;
     A pretty woman (that 's quite natural,
       Or else the thing had hardly come to pass);
     A husband rather old, not much in unity
     With his young wife--a time, and opportunity.

     Well--well, the world must turn upon its axis,
       And all mankind turn with it, heads or tails,
     And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,
       And as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails;
     The king commands us, and the doctor quacks us,
       The priest instructs, and so our life exhales,
     A little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,
     Fighting, devotion, dust,--perhaps a name.

     I said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz--
       A pretty town, I recollect it well--
     'T is there the mart of the colonial trade is
       (Or was, before Peru learn'd to rebel),
     And such sweet girls--I mean, such graceful ladies,
       Their very walk would make your bosom swell;
     I can't describe it, though so much it strike,
     Nor liken it--I never saw the like:

     An Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb
       New broke, a cameleopard, a gazelle,
     No--none of these will do;--and then their garb!
       Their veil and petticoat--Alas! to dwell
     Upon such things would very near absorb
       A canto--then their feet and ankles,--well,
     Thank Heaven I 've got no metaphor quite ready
     (And so, my sober Muse--come, let 's be steady--

     Chaste Muse!--well, if you must, you must)--the veil
       Thrown back a moment with the glancing hand,
     While the o'erpowering eye, that turns you pale,
       Flashes into the heart:--All sunny land
     Of love! when I forget you, may I fail
       To--say my prayers--but never was there plann'd
     A dress through which the eyes give such a volley,
     Excepting the Venetian Fazzioli.

     But to our tale: the Donna Inez sent
       Her son to Cadiz only to embark;
     To stay there had not answer'd her intent,
       But why?--we leave the reader in the dark--
     'T was for a voyage that the young man was meant,
       As if a Spanish ship were Noah's ark,
     To wean him from the wickedness of earth,
     And send him like a dove of promise forth.

     Don Juan bade his valet pack his things
       According to direction, then received
     A lecture and some money: for four springs
       He was to travel; and though Inez grieved
     (As every kind of parting has its stings),
       She hoped he would improve--perhaps believed:
     A letter, too, she gave (he never read it)
     Of good advice--and two or three of credit.

     In the mean time, to pass her hours away,
       Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school
     For naughty children, who would rather play
       (Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;
     Infants of three years old were taught that day,
       Dunces were whipt, or set upon a stool:
     The great success of Juan's education,
     Spurr'd her to teach another generation.

     Juan embark'd--the ship got under way,
       The wind was fair, the water passing rough:
     A devil of a sea rolls in that bay,
       As I, who 've cross'd it oft, know well enough;
     And, standing upon deck, the dashing spray
       Flies in one's face, and makes it weather-tough:
     And there he stood to take, and take again,
     His first--perhaps his last--farewell of Spain.

     I can't but say it is an awkward sight
       To see one's native land receding through
     The growing waters; it unmans one quite,
       Especially when life is rather new:
     I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,
       But almost every other country 's blue,
     When gazing on them, mystified by distance,
     We enter on our nautical existence.

     So Juan stood, bewilder'd on the deck:
       The wind sung, cordage strain'd, and sailors swore,
     And the ship creak'd, the town became a speck,
       From which away so fair and fast they bore.
     The best of remedies is a beef-steak
       Against sea-sickness: try it, sir, before
     You sneer, and I assure you this is true,
     For I have found it answer--so may you.

     Don Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,
       Beheld his native Spain receding far:
     First partings form a lesson hard to learn,
       Even nations feel this when they go to war;
     There is a sort of unexprest concern,
       A kind of shock that sets one's heart ajar:
     At leaving even the most unpleasant people
     And places, one keeps looking at the steeple.

     But Juan had got many things to leave,
       His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,
     So that he had much better cause to grieve
       Than many persons more advanced in life;
     And if we now and then a sigh must heave
       At quitting even those we quit in strife,
     No doubt we weep for those the heart endears--
     That is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.

     So Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews
       By Babel's waters, still remembering Sion:
     I 'd weep,--but mine is not a weeping Muse,
       And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;
     Young men should travel, if but to amuse
       Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on
     Behind their carriages their new portmanteau,
     Perhaps it may be lined with this my canto.

     And Juan wept, and much he sigh'd and thought,
       While his salt tears dropp'd into the salt sea,
     'Sweets to the sweet' (I like so much to quote;
       You must excuse this extract, 't is where she,
     The Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought
       Flowers to the grave); and, sobbing often, he
     Reflected on his present situation,
     And seriously resolved on reformation.

     'Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!' he cried,
       'Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,
     But die, as many an exiled heart hath died,
       Of its own thirst to see again thy shore:
     Farewell, where Guadalquivir's waters glide!
       Farewell, my mother! and, since all is o'er,
     Farewell, too, dearest Julia!--(Here he drew
     Her letter out again, and read it through.)

     'And, oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear--
       But that 's impossible, and cannot be--
     Sooner shall this blue ocean melt to air,
       Sooner shall earth resolve itself to sea,
     Than I resign thine image, oh, my fair!
       Or think of any thing excepting thee;
     A mind diseased no remedy can physic
     (Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick).

     'Sooner shall heaven kiss earth (here he fell sicker),
       O, Julia! what is every other wo?
     (For God's sake let me have a glass of liquor;
       Pedro, Battista, help me down below.)
     Julia, my love! (you rascal, Pedro, quicker)--
       O, Julia! (this curst vessel pitches so)--
     Beloved Julia, hear me still beseeching!'
     (Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)

     He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,
       Or rather stomach, which, alas! attends,
     Beyond the best apothecary's art,
       The loss of love, the treachery of friends,
     Or death of those we dote on, when a part
       Of us dies with them as each fond hope ends:
     No doubt he would have been much more pathetic,
     But the sea acted as a strong emetic. I

     Love 's a capricious power: I 've known it hold
       Out through a fever caused by its own heat,
     But be much puzzled by a cough and cold,
       And find a quincy very hard to treat;
     Against all noble maladies he 's bold,
       But vulgar illnesses don't like to meet,
     Nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,
     Nor inflammations redden his blind eye.

     But worst of all is nausea, or a pain
       About the lower region of the bowels;
     Love, who heroically breathes a vein,
       Shrinks from the application of hot towels,
     And purgatives are dangerous to his reign,
       Sea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else
     Could Juan's passion, while the billows roar,
     Resist his stomach, ne'er at sea before?

     The ship, call'd the most holy 'Trinidada,'
       Was steering duly for the port Leghorn;
     For there the Spanish family Moncada
       Were settled long ere Juan's sire was born:
     They were relations, and for them he had a
       Letter of introduction, which the morn
     Of his departure had been sent him by
     His Spanish friends for those in Italy.

     His suite consisted of three servants and
       A tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,
     Who several languages did understand,
       But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow,
     And rocking in his hammock, long'd for land,
       His headache being increased by every billow;
     And the waves oozing through the port-hole made
     His berth a little damp, and him afraid.

     'T was not without some reason, for the wind
       Increased at night, until it blew a gale;
     And though 't was not much to a naval mind,
       Some landsmen would have look'd a little pale,
     For sailors are, in fact, a different kind:
       At sunset they began to take in sail,
     For the sky show'd it would come on to blow,
     And carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.

     At one o'clock the wind with sudden shift
       Threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,
     Which struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,
       Started the stern-post, also shatter'd the
     Whole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift
       Herself from out her present jeopardy,
     The rudder tore away: 't was time to sound
     The pumps, and there were four feet water found.

     One gang of people instantly was put
       Upon the pumps and the remainder set
     To get up part of the cargo, and what not;
       But they could not come at the leak as yet;
     At last they did get at it really, but
       Still their salvation was an even bet:
     The water rush'd through in a way quite puzzling,
     While they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,

     Into the opening; but all such ingredients
       Would have been vain, and they must have gone down,
     Despite of all their efforts and expedients,
       But for the pumps: I 'm glad to make them known
     To all the brother tars who may have need hence,
       For fifty tons of water were upthrown
     By them per hour, and they had all been undone,
     But for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.

     As day advanced the weather seem'd to abate,
       And then the leak they reckon'd to reduce,
     And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet
       Kept two hand and one chain-pump still in use.
     The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late
       A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,
     A gust--which all descriptive power transcends--
     Laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.

     There she lay motionless, and seem'd upset;
       The water left the hold, and wash'd the decks,
     And made a scene men do not soon forget;
       For they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,
     Or any other thing that brings regret,
       Or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:
     Thus drownings are much talk'd of by the divers,
     And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.

     Immediately the masts were cut away,
       Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,
     The main-mast follow'd: but the ship still lay
       Like a mere log, and baffled our intent.
     Foremast and bowsprit were cut down, and they
       Eased her at last (although we never meant
     To part with all till every hope was blighted),
     And then with violence the old ship righted.

     It may be easily supposed, while this
       Was going on, some people were unquiet,
     That passengers would find it much amiss
       To lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;
     That even the able seaman, deeming his
       Days nearly o'er, might be disposed to riot,
     As upon such occasions tars will ask
     For grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.

     There 's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms
       As rum and true religion: thus it was,
     Some plunder'd, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,
       The high wind made the treble, and as bas
     The hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms
       Of all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:
     Strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,
     Clamour'd in chorus to the roaring ocean.

     Perhaps more mischief had been done, but for
       Our Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,
     Got to the spirit-room, and stood before
       It with a pair of pistols; and their fears,
     As if Death were more dreadful by his door
       Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,
     Kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,
     Thought it would be becoming to die drunk.

     'Give us more grog,' they cried, 'for it will be
       All one an hour hence.' Juan answer'd, 'No!
     'T is true that death awaits both you and me,
       But let us die like men, not sink below
     Like brutes;'--and thus his dangerous post kept he,
       And none liked to anticipate the blow;
     And even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,
     Was for some rum a disappointed suitor.

     The good old gentleman was quite aghast,
       And made a loud and pious lamentation;
     Repented all his sins, and made a last
       Irrevocable vow of reformation;
     Nothing should tempt him more (this peril past)
       To quit his academic occupation,
     In cloisters of the classic Salamanca,
     To follow Juan's wake, like Sancho Panca.

     But now there came a flash of hope once more;
       Day broke, and the wind lull'd: the masts were gone,
     The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,
       The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.
     They tried the pumps again, and though before
       Their desperate efforts seem'd all useless grown,
     A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale--
     The stronger pump'd, the weaker thrumm'd a sail.

     Under the vessel's keel the sail was past,
       And for the moment it had some effect;
     But with a leak, and not a stick of mast,
       Nor rag of canvas, what could they expect?
     But still 't is best to struggle to the last,
       'T is never too late to be wholly wreck'd:
     And though 't is true that man can only die once,
     'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.

     There winds and waves had hurl'd them, and from thence,
       Without their will, they carried them away;
     For they were forced with steering to dispense,
       And never had as yet a quiet day
     On which they might repose, or even commence
       A jurymast or rudder, or could say
     The ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,
     Still swam--though not exactly like a duck.

     The wind, in fact, perhaps was rather less,
       But the ship labour'd so, they scarce could hope
     To weather out much longer; the distress
       Was also great with which they had to cope
     For want of water, and their solid mess
       Was scant enough: in vain the telescope
     Was used--nor sail nor shore appear'd in sight,
     Nought but the heavy sea, and coming night.

     Again the weather threaten'd,--again blew
       A gale, and in the fore and after hold
     Water appear'd; yet, though the people knew
       All this, the most were patient, and some bold,
     Until the chains and leathers were worn through
       Of all our pumps:--a wreck complete she roll'd,
     At mercy of the waves, whose mercies are
     Like human beings during civil war.

     Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears
       In his rough eyes, and told the captain he
     Could do no more: he was a man in years,
       And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,
     And if he wept at length, they were not fears
       That made his eyelids as a woman's be,
     But he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,--
     Two things for dying people quite bewildering.

     The ship was evidently settling now
       Fast by the head; and, all distinction gone,
     Some went to prayers again, and made a vow
       Of candles to their saints--but there were none
     To pay them with; and some look'd o'er the bow;
       Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one
     That begg'd Pedrillo for an absolution,
     Who told him to be damn'd--in his confusion.

     Some lash'd them in their hammocks; some put on
       Their best clothes, as if going to a fair;
     Some cursed the day on which they saw the sun,
       And gnash'd their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;
     And others went on as they had begun,
       Getting the boats out, being well aware
     That a tight boat will live in a rough sea,
     Unless with breakers close beneath her lee.

     The worst of all was, that in their condition,
       Having been several days in great distress,
     'T was difficult to get out such provision
       As now might render their long suffering less:
     Men, even when dying, dislike inanition;
       Their stock was damaged by the weather's stress:
     Two casks of biscuit and a keg of butter
     Were all that could be thrown into the cutter.

     But in the long-boat they contrived to stow
       Some pounds of bread, though injured by the wet;
     Water, a twenty-gallon cask or so;
       Six flasks of wine; and they contrived to get
     A portion of their beef up from below,
       And with a piece of pork, moreover, met,
     But scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon--
     Then there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.

     The other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had
       Been stove in the beginning of the gale;
     And the long-boat's condition was but bad,
       As there were but two blankets for a sail,
     And one oar for a mast, which a young lad
       Threw in by good luck over the ship's rail;
     And two boats could not hold, far less be stored,
     To save one half the people then on board.

     'T was twilight, and the sunless day went down
       Over the waste of waters; like a veil,
     Which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown
       Of one whose hate is mask'd but to assail,
     Thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,
       And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,
     And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear
     Been their familiar, and now Death was here.

     Some trial had been making at a raft,
       With little hope in such a rolling sea,
     A sort of thing at which one would have laugh'd,
       If any laughter at such times could be,
     Unless with people who too much have quaff'd,
       And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,
     Half epileptical and half hysterical:--
     Their preservation would have been a miracle.

     At half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,
       And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,
     That still could keep afloat the struggling tars,
       For yet they strove, although of no great use:
     There was no light in heaven but a few stars,
       The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;
     She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,
     And, going down head foremost--sunk, in short.

     Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell--
       Then shriek'd the timid, and stood still the brave,
     Then some leap'd overboard with dreadful yell,
       As eager to anticipate their grave;
     And the sea yawn'd around her like a hell,
       And down she suck'd with her the whirling wave,
     Like one who grapples with his enemy,
     And strives to strangle him before he die.

     And first one universal shriek there rush'd,
       Louder than the loud ocean, like a crash
     Of echoing thunder; and then all was hush'd,
       Save the wild wind and the remorseless dash
     Of billows; but at intervals there gush'd,
       Accompanied with a convulsive splash,
     A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry
     Of some strong swimmer in his agony.

     The boats, as stated, had got off before,
       And in them crowded several of the crew;
     And yet their present hope was hardly more
       Than what it had been, for so strong it blew
     There was slight chance of reaching any shore;
       And then they were too many, though so few--
     Nine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,
     Were counted in them when they got afloat.

     All the rest perish'd; near two hundred souls
       Had left their bodies; and what 's worse, alas!
     When over Catholics the ocean rolls,
       They must wait several weeks before a mass
     Takes off one peck of purgatorial coals,
       Because, till people know what 's come to pass,
     They won't lay out their money on the dead--
     It costs three francs for every mass that 's said.

     Juan got into the long-boat, and there
       Contrived to help Pedrillo to a place;
     It seem'd as if they had exchanged their care,
       For Juan wore the magisterial face
     Which courage gives, while poor Pedrillo's pair
       Of eyes were crying for their owner's case:
     Battista; though (a name call'd shortly Tita),
     Was lost by getting at some aqua-vita.

     Pedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,
       But the same cause, conducive to his loss,
     Left him so drunk, he jump'd into the wave
       As o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,
     And so he found a wine-and-watery grave;
       They could not rescue him although so close,
     Because the sea ran higher every minute,
     And for the boat--the crew kept crowding in it.

     A small old spaniel,--which had been Don Jose's,
       His father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,
     For on such things the memory reposes
       With tenderness--stood howling on the brink,
     Knowing (dogs have such intellectual noses!),
       No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;
     And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepp'd
     Off, threw him in, then after him he leap'd.

     He also stuff'd his money where he could
       About his person, and Pedrillo's too,
     Who let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,
       Not knowing what himself to say, or do,
     As every rising wave his dread renew'd;
       But Juan, trusting they might still get through,
     And deeming there were remedies for any ill,
     Thus re-embark'd his tutor and his spaniel.

     'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,
       That the sail was becalm'd between the seas,
     Though on the wave's high top too much to set,
       They dared not take it in for all the breeze:
     Each sea curl'd o'er the stern, and kept them wet,
       And made them bale without a moment's ease,
     So that themselves as well as hopes were damp'd,
     And the poor little cutter quickly swamp'd.

     Nine souls more went in her: the long-boat still
       Kept above water, with an oar for mast,
     Two blankets stitch'd together, answering ill
       Instead of sail, were to the oar made fast:
     Though every wave roll'd menacing to fill,
       And present peril all before surpass'd,
     They grieved for those who perish'd with the cutter,
     And also for the biscuit-casks and butter.

     The sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign
       Of the continuance of the gale: to run
     Before the sea until it should grow fine,
       Was all that for the present could be done:
     A few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine
       Were served out to the people, who begun
     To faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags,
     And most of them had little clothes but rags.

     They counted thirty, crowded in a space
       Which left scarce room for motion or exertion;
     They did their best to modify their case,
       One half sate up, though numb'd with the immersion,
     While t'other half were laid down in their place
       At watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian
     Ague in its cold fit, they fill'd their boat,
     With nothing but the sky for a great coat.

     'T is very certain the desire of life
       Prolongs it: this is obvious to physicians,
     When patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,
       Survive through very desperate conditions,
     Because they still can hope, nor shines the knife
       Nor shears of Atropos before their visions:
     Despair of all recovery spoils longevity,
     And makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity.

     'T is said that persons living on annuities
       Are longer lived than others,--God knows why,
     Unless to plague the grantors,--yet so true it is,
       That some, I really think, do never die;
     Of any creditors the worst a Jew it is,
       And that 's their mode of furnishing supply:
     In my young days they lent me cash that way,
     Which I found very troublesome to pay.

     'T is thus with people in an open boat,
       They live upon the love of life, and bear
     More than can be believed, or even thought,
       And stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;
     And hardship still has been the sailor's lot,
       Since Noah's ark went cruising here and there;
     She had a curious crew as well as cargo,
     Like the first old Greek privateer, the Argo.

     But man is a carnivorous production,
       And must have meals, at least one meal a day;
     He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,
       But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;
     Although his anatomical construction
       Bears vegetables, in a grumbling way,
     Your labouring people think beyond all question,
     Beef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.

     And thus it was with this our hapless crew;
       For on the third day there came on a calm,
     And though at first their strength it might renew,
       And lying on their weariness like balm,
     Lull'd them like turtles sleeping on the blue
       Of ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,
     And fell all ravenously on their provision,
     Instead of hoarding it with due precision.

     The consequence was easily foreseen--
       They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,
     In spite of all remonstrances, and then
       On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?
     They hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!
       And carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,
     But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,
     It would have been more wise to save their victual.

     The fourth day came, but not a breath of air,
       And Ocean slumber'd like an unwean'd child:
     The fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,
       The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild--
     With their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)
       What could they do? and hunger's rage grew wild:
     So Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,
     Was kill'd and portion'd out for present eating.

     On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,
       And Juan, who had still refused, because
     The creature was his father's dog that died,
       Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,
     With some remorse received (though first denied)
       As a great favour one of the fore-paws,
     Which he divided with Pedrillo, who
     Devour'd it, longing for the other too.

     The seventh day, and no wind--the burning sun
       Blister'd and scorch'd, and, stagnant on the sea,
     They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,
       Save in the breeze that came not; savagely
     They glared upon each other--all was done,
       Water, and wine, and food,--and you might see
     The longings of the cannibal arise
     (Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.

     At length one whisper'd his companion, who
       Whisper'd another, and thus it went round,
     And then into a hoarser murmur grew,
       An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;
     And when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,
       'T was but his own, suppress'd till now, he found:
     And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,
     And who should die to be his fellow's food.

     But ere they came to this, they that day shared
       Some leathern caps, and what remain'd of shoes;
     And then they look'd around them and despair'd,
       And none to be the sacrifice would choose;
     At length the lots were torn up, and prepared,
       But of materials that much shock the Muse--
     Having no paper, for the want of better,
     They took by force from Juan Julia's letter.

     The lots were made, and mark'd, and mix'd, and handed,
       In silent horror, and their distribution
     Lull'd even the savage hunger which demanded,
       Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;
     None in particular had sought or plann'd it,
       'T was nature gnaw'd them to this resolution,
     By which none were permitted to be neuter--
     And the lot fell on Juan's luckless tutor.

     He but requested to be bled to death:
       The surgeon had his instruments, and bled
     Pedrillo, and so gently ebb'd his breath,
       You hardly could perceive when he was dead.
     He died as born, a Catholic in faith,
       Like most in the belief in which they 're bred,
     And first a little crucifix he kiss'd,
     And then held out his jugular and wrist.

     The surgeon, as there was no other fee,
       Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;
     But being thirstiest at the moment, he
       Preferr'd a draught from the fast-flowing veins:
     Part was divided, part thrown in the sea,
       And such things as the entrails and the brains
     Regaled two sharks, who follow'd o'er the billow--
     The sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.

     The sailors ate him, all save three or four,
       Who were not quite so fond of animal food;
     To these was added Juan, who, before
       Refusing his own spaniel, hardly could
     Feel now his appetite increased much more;
       'T was not to be expected that he should,
     Even in extremity of their disaster,
     Dine with them on his pastor and his master.

     'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,
       The consequence was awful in the extreme;
     For they, who were most ravenous in the act,
       Went raging mad--Lord! how they did blaspheme!
     And foam and roll, with strange convulsions rack'd,
       Drinking salt water like a mountain-stream,
     Tearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,
     And, with hyaena-laughter, died despairing.

     Their numbers were much thinn'd by this infliction,
       And all the rest were thin enough, Heaven knows;
     And some of them had lost their recollection,
       Happier than they who still perceived their woes;
     But others ponder'd on a new dissection,
       As if not warn'd sufficiently by those
     Who had already perish'd, suffering madly,
     For having used their appetites so sadly.

     And next they thought upon the master's mate,
       As fattest; but he saved himself, because,
     Besides being much averse from such a fate,
       There were some other reasons: the first was,
     He had been rather indisposed of late;
       And that which chiefly proved his saving clause
     Was a small present made to him at Cadiz,
     By general subscription of the ladies.

     Of poor Pedrillo something still remain'd,
       But was used sparingly,--some were afraid,
     And others still their appetites constrain'd,
       Or but at times a little supper made;
     All except Juan, who throughout abstain'd,
       Chewing a piece of bamboo and some lead:
     At length they caught two boobies and a noddy,
     And then they left off eating the dead body.

     And if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,
       Remember Ugolino condescends
     To eat the head of his arch-enemy
       The moment after he politely ends
     His tale: if foes be food in hell, at sea
       'T is surely fair to dine upon our friends,
     When shipwreck's short allowance grows too scanty,
     Without being much more horrible than Dante.

     And the same night there fell a shower of rain,
       For which their mouths gaped, like the cracks of earth
     When dried to summer dust; till taught by pain
       Men really know not what good water 's worth;
     If you had been in Turkey or in Spain,
       Or with a famish'd boat's-crew had your berth,
     Or in the desert heard the camel's bell,
     You 'd wish yourself where Truth is--in a well.

     It pour'd down torrents, but they were no richer
       Until they found a ragged piece of sheet,
     Which served them as a sort of spongy pitcher,
       And when they deem'd its moisture was complete
     They wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher
       Might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet
     As a full pot of porter, to their thinking
     They ne'er till now had known the joys of drinking.

     And their baked lips, with many a bloody crack,
       Suck'd in the moisture, which like nectar stream'd;
     Their throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,
       As the rich man's in hell, who vainly scream'd
     To beg the beggar, who could not rain back
       A drop of dew, when every drop had seem'd
     To taste of heaven--If this be true, indeed
     Some Christians have a comfortable creed.

     There were two fathers in this ghastly crew,
       And with them their two sons, of whom the one
     Was more robust and hardy to the view,
       But he died early; and when he was gone,
     His nearest messmate told his sire, who threw
       One glance at him, and said, 'Heaven's will be done!
     I can do nothing,' and he saw him thrown
     Into the deep without a tear or groan.

     The other father had a weaklier child,
       Of a soft cheek and aspect delicate;
     But the boy bore up long, and with a mild
       And patient spirit held aloof his fate;
     Little he said, and now and then he smiled,
       As if to win a part from off the weight
     He saw increasing on his father's heart,
     With the deep deadly thought that they must part.

     And o'er him bent his sire, and never raised
       His eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam
     From his pale lips, and ever on him gazed,
       And when the wish'd-for shower at length was come,
     And the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,
       Brighten'd, and for a moment seem'd to roam,
     He squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain
     Into his dying child's mouth--but in vain.

     The boy expired--the father held the clay,
       And look'd upon it long, and when at last
     Death left no doubt, and the dead burthen lay
       Stiff on his heart, and pulse and hope were past,
     He watch'd it wistfully, until away
       'T was borne by the rude wave wherein 't was cast;
     Then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering,
     And gave no sign of life, save his limbs quivering.

     Now overhead a rainbow, bursting through
       The scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea,
     Resting its bright base on the quivering blue;
       And all within its arch appear'd to be
     Clearer than that without, and its wide hue
       Wax'd broad and waving, like a banner free,
     Then changed like to a bow that 's bent, and then
     Forsook the dim eyes of these shipwreck'd men.

     It changed, of course; a heavenly chameleon,
       The airy child of vapour and the sun,
     Brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,
       Baptized in molten gold, and swathed in dun,
     Glittering like crescents o'er a Turk's pavilion,
       And blending every colour into one,
     Just like a black eye in a recent scuffle
     (For sometimes we must box without the muffle).

     Our shipwreck'd seamen thought it a good omen--
       It is as well to think so, now and then;
     'T was an old custom of the Greek and Roman,
       And may become of great advantage when
     Folks are discouraged; and most surely no men
       Had greater need to nerve themselves again
     Than these, and so this rainbow look'd like hope--
     Quite a celestial kaleidoscope.

     About this time a beautiful white bird,
       Webfooted, not unlike a dove in size
     And plumage (probably it might have err'd
       Upon its course), pass'd oft before their eyes,
     And tried to perch, although it saw and heard
       The men within the boat, and in this guise
     It came and went, and flutter'd round them till
     Night fell: this seem'd a better omen still.

     But in this case I also must remark,
       'T was well this bird of promise did not perch,
     Because the tackle of our shatter'd bark
       Was not so safe for roosting as a church;
     And had it been the dove from Noah's ark,
       Returning there from her successful search,
     Which in their way that moment chanced to fall,
     They would have eat her, olive-branch and all.

     With twilight it again came on to blow,
       But not with violence; the stars shone out,
     The boat made way; yet now they were so low,
       They knew not where nor what they were about;
     Some fancied they saw land, and some said 'No!'
       The frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt--
     Some swore that they heard breakers, others guns,
     And all mistook about the latter once.

     As morning broke, the light wind died away,
       When he who had the watch sung out and swore,
     If 't was not land that rose with the sun's ray,
       He wish'd that land he never might see more;
     And the rest rubb'd their eyes and saw a bay,
       Or thought they saw, and shaped their course for shore;
     For shore it was, and gradually grew
     Distinct, and high, and palpable to view.

     And then of these some part burst into tears,
       And others, looking with a stupid stare,
     Could not yet separate their hopes from fears,
       And seem'd as if they had no further care;
     While a few pray'd (the first time for some years)--
       And at the bottom of the boat three were
     Asleep: they shook them by the hand and head,
     And tried to awaken them, but found them dead.

     The day before, fast sleeping on the water,
       They found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,
     And by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,
       Which yielded a day's life, and to their mind
     Proved even still a more nutritious matter,
       Because it left encouragement behind:
     They thought that in such perils, more than chance
     Had sent them this for their deliverance.

     The land appear'd a high and rocky coast,
       And higher grew the mountains as they drew,
     Set by a current, toward it: they were lost
       In various conjectures, for none knew
     To what part of the earth they had been tost,
       So changeable had been the winds that blew;
     Some thought it was Mount AEtna, some the highlands,
     Of Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, or other islands.

     Meantime the current, with a rising gale,
       Still set them onwards to the welcome shore,
     Like Charon's bark of spectres, dull and pale:
       Their living freight was now reduced to four,
     And three dead, whom their strength could not avail
       To heave into the deep with those before,
     Though the two sharks still follow'd them, and dash'd
     The spray into their faces as they splash'd.

     Famine, despair, cold, thirst, and heat, had done
       Their work on them by turns, and thinn'd them to
     Such things a mother had not known her son
       Amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew;
     By night chill'd, by day scorch'd, thus one by one
       They perish'd, until wither'd to these few,
     But chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,
     In washing down Pedrillo with salt water.

     As they drew nigh the land, which now was seen
       Unequal in its aspect here and there,
     They felt the freshness of its growing green,
       That waved in forest-tops, and smooth'd the air,
     And fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen
       From glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare--
     Lovely seem'd any object that should sweep
     Away the vast, salt, dread, eternal deep.

     The shore look'd wild, without a trace of man,
       And girt by formidable waves; but they
     Were mad for land, and thus their course they ran,
       Though right ahead the roaring breakers lay:
     A reef between them also now began
       To show its boiling surf and bounding spray,
     But finding no place for their landing better,
     They ran the boat for shore,--and overset her.

     But in his native stream, the Guadalquivir,
       Juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont;
     And having learnt to swim in that sweet river,
       Had often turn'd the art to some account:
     A better swimmer you could scarce see ever,
       He could, perhaps, have pass'd the Hellespont,
     As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)
     Leander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.

     So here, though faint, emaciated, and stark,
       He buoy'd his boyish limbs, and strove to ply
     With the quick wave, and gain, ere it was dark,
       The beach which lay before him, high and dry:
     The greatest danger here was from a shark,
       That carried off his neighbour by the thigh;
     As for the other two, they could not swim,
     So nobody arrived on shore but him.

     Nor yet had he arrived but for the oar,
       Which, providentially for him, was wash'd
     Just as his feeble arms could strike no more,
       And the hard wave o'erwhelm'd him as 't was dash'd
     Within his grasp; he clung to it, and sore
       The waters beat while he thereto was lash'd;
     At last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he
     Roll'd on the beach, half-senseless, from the sea:

     There, breathless, with his digging nails he clung
       Fast to the sand, lest the returning wave,
     From whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,
       Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:
     And there he lay, full length, where he was flung,
       Before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,
     With just enough of life to feel its pain,
     And deem that it was saved, perhaps in vain.

     With slow and staggering effort he arose,
       But sunk again upon his bleeding knee
     And quivering hand; and then he look'd for those
       Who long had been his mates upon the sea;
     But none of them appear'd to share his woes,
       Save one, a corpse, from out the famish'd three,
     Who died two days before, and now had found
     An unknown barren beach for burial ground.

     And as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,
       And down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand
     Swam round and round, and all his senses pass'd:
       He fell upon his side, and his stretch'd hand
     Droop'd dripping on the oar (their jurymast),
       And, like a wither'd lily, on the land
     His slender frame and pallid aspect lay,
     As fair a thing as e'er was form'd of clay.

     How long in his damp trance young Juan lay
       He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,
     And Time had nothing more of night nor day
       For his congealing blood, and senses dim;
     And how this heavy faintness pass'd away
       He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,
     And tingling vein, seem'd throbbing back to life,
     For Death, though vanquish'd, still retired with strife.

     His eyes he open'd, shut, again unclosed,
       For all was doubt and dizziness; he thought
     He still was in the boat and had but dozed,
       And felt again with his despair o'erwrought,
     And wish'd it death in which he had reposed;
       And then once more his feelings back were brought,
     And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen
     A lovely female face of seventeen.

     'T was bending dose o'er his, and the small mouth
       Seem'd almost prying into his for breath;
     And chafing him, the soft warm hand of youth
       Recall'd his answering spirits back from death;
     And, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe
       Each pulse to animation, till beneath
     Its gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh
     To these kind efforts made a low reply.

     Then was the cordial pour'd, and mantle flung
       Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm
     Raised higher the faint head which o'er it hung;
       And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,
     Pillow'd his death-like forehead; then she wrung
       His dewy curls, long drench'd by every storm;
     And watch'd with eagerness each throb that drew
     A sigh from his heaved bosom--and hers, too.

     And lifting him with care into the cave,
       The gentle girl and her attendant,--one
     Young, yet her elder, and of brow less grave,
       And more robust of figure,--then begun
     To kindle fire, and as the new flames gave
       Light to the rocks that roof'd them, which the sun
     Had never seen, the maid, or whatsoe'er
     She was, appear'd distinct, and tall, and fair.

     Her brow was overhung with coins of gold,
       That sparkled o'er the auburn of her hair--
     Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were roll'd
       In braids behind; and though her stature were
     Even of the highest for a female mould,
       They nearly reach'd her heel; and in her air
     There was a something which bespoke command,
     As one who was a lady in the land.

     Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes
       Were black as death, their lashes the same hue,
     Of downcast length, in whose silk shadow lies
       Deepest attraction; for when to the view
     Forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,
       Ne'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;
     'T is as the snake late coil'd, who pours his length,
     And hurls at once his venom and his strength.

     Her brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye
       Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;
     Short upper lip--sweet lips! that make us sigh
       Ever to have seen such; for she was one
     Fit for the model of a statuary
       (A race of mere impostors, when all 's done--
     I 've seen much finer women, ripe and real,
     Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal).

     I 'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just
       One should not rail without a decent cause:
     There was an Irish lady, to whose bust
       I ne'er saw justice done, and yet she was
     A frequent model; and if e'er she must
       Yield to stern Time and Nature's wrinkling laws,
     They will destroy a face which mortal thought
     Ne'er compass'd, nor less mortal chisel wrought.

     And such was she, the lady of the cave:
       Her dress was very different from the Spanish,
     Simpler, and yet of colours not so grave;
       For, as you know, the Spanish women banish
     Bright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave
       Around them (what I hope will never vanish)
     The basquina and the mantilla, they
     Seem at the same time mystical and gay.

     But with our damsel this was not the case:
       Her dress was many-colour'd, finely spun;
     Her locks curl'd negligently round her face,
       But through them gold and gems profusely shone:
     Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace
       Flow'd in her veil, and many a precious stone
     Flash'd on her little hand; but, what was shocking,
     Her small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.

     The other female's dress was not unlike,
       But of inferior materials: she
     Had not so many ornaments to strike,
       Her hair had silver only, bound to be
     Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,
       Was coarser; and her air, though firm, less free;
     Her hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes
     As black, but quicker, and of smaller size.

     And these two tended him, and cheer'd him both
       With food and raiment, and those soft attentions,
     Which are (as I must own) of female growth,
       And have ten thousand delicate inventions:
     They made a most superior mess of broth,
       A thing which poesy but seldom mentions,
     But the best dish that e'er was cook'd since Homer's
     Achilles ordered dinner for new comers.

     I 'll tell you who they were, this female pair,
       Lest they should seem princesses in disguise;
     Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air
       Of clap-trap which your recent poets prize;
     And so, in short, the girls they really were
       They shall appear before your curious eyes,
     Mistress and maid; the first was only daughter
     Of an old man who lived upon the water.

     A fisherman he had been in his youth,
       And still a sort of fisherman was he;
     But other speculations were, in sooth,
       Added to his connection with the sea,
     Perhaps not so respectable, in truth:
       A little smuggling, and some piracy,
     Left him, at last, the sole of many masters
     Of an ill-gotten million of piastres.

     A fisher, therefore, was he,--though of men,
       Like Peter the Apostle,--and he fish'd
     For wandering merchant-vessels, now and then,
       And sometimes caught as many as he wish'd;
     The cargoes he confiscated, and gain
       He sought in the slave-market too, and dish'd
     Full many a morsel for that Turkish trade,
     By which, no doubt, a good deal may be made.

     He was a Greek, and on his isle had built
       (One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)
     A very handsome house from out his guilt,
       And there he lived exceedingly at ease;
     Heaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt,
       A sad old fellow was he, if you please;
     But this I know, it was a spacious building,
     Full of barbaric carving, paint, and gilding.

     He had an only daughter, call'd Haidee,
       The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;
     Besides, so very beautiful was she,
       Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:
     Still in her teens, and like a lovely tree
       She grew to womanhood, and between whiles
     Rejected several suitors, just to learn
     How to accept a better in his turn.

     And walking out upon the beach, below
       The cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,
     Insensible,--not dead, but nearly so,--
       Don Juan, almost famish'd, and half drown'd;
     But being naked, she was shock'd, you know,
       Yet deem'd herself in common pity bound,
     As far as in her lay, 'to take him in,
     A stranger' dying, with so white a skin.

     But taking him into her father's house
       Was not exactly the best way to save,
     But like conveying to the cat the mouse,
       Or people in a trance into their grave;
     Because the good old man had so much 'nous,'
       Unlike the honest Arab thieves so brave,
     He would have hospitably cured the stranger,
     And sold him instantly when out of danger.

     And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best
       (A virgin always on her maid relies)
     To place him in the cave for present rest:
       And when, at last, he open'd his black eyes,
     Their charity increased about their guest;
       And their compassion grew to such a size,
     It open'd half the turnpike-gates to heaven
     (St. Paul says, 't is the toll which must be given).

     They made a fire,--but such a fire as they
       Upon the moment could contrive with such
     Materials as were cast up round the bay,--
       Some broken planks, and oars, that to the touch
     Were nearly tinder, since so long they lay
       A mast was almost crumbled to a crutch;
     But, by God's grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,
     That there was fuel to have furnish'd twenty.

     He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,
       For Haidee stripped her sables off to make
     His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,
       And warm, in case by chance he should awake,
     They also gave a petticoat apiece,
       She and her maid--and promised by daybreak
     To pay him a fresh visit, with a dish
     For breakfast, of eggs, coffee, bread, and fish.

     And thus they left him to his lone repose:
       Juan slept like a top, or like the dead,
     Who sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows),
       Just for the present; and in his lull'd head
     Not even a vision of his former woes
       Throbb'd in accursed dreams, which sometimes spread
     Unwelcome visions of our former years,
     Till the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears.

     Young Juan slept all dreamless:--but the maid,
       Who smooth'd his pillow, as she left the den
     Look'd back upon him, and a moment stay'd,
       And turn'd, believing that he call'd again.
     He slumber'd; yet she thought, at least she said
       (The heart will slip, even as the tongue and pen),
     He had pronounced her name--but she forgot
     That at this moment Juan knew it not.

     And pensive to her father's house she went,
       Enjoining silence strict to Zoe, who
     Better than her knew what, in fact, she meant,
       She being wiser by a year or two:
     A year or two 's an age when rightly spent,
       And Zoe spent hers, as most women do,
     In gaining all that useful sort of knowledge
     Which is acquired in Nature's good old college.

     The morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still
       Fast in his cave, and nothing clash'd upon
     His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,
       And the young beams of the excluded sun,
     Troubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;
       And need he had of slumber yet, for none
     Had suffer'd more--his hardships were comparative
     To those related in my grand-dad's 'Narrative.'

     Not so Haidee: she sadly toss'd and tumbled,
       And started from her sleep, and, turning o'er
     Dream'd of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,
       And handsome corpses strew'd upon the shore;
     And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,
       And call'd her father's old slaves up, who swore
     In several oaths--Armenian, Turk, and Greek--
     They knew not what to think of such a freak.

     But up she got, and up she made them get,
       With some pretence about the sun, that makes
     Sweet skies just when he rises, or is set;
       And 't is, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks
     Bright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet
       With mist, and every bird with him awakes,
     And night is flung off like a mourning suit
     Worn for a husband,--or some other brute.

     I say, the sun is a most glorious sight,
       I 've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late
     I have sat up on purpose all the night,
       Which hastens, as physicians say, one's fate;
     And so all ye, who would be in the right
       In health and purse, begin your day to date
     From daybreak, and when coffin'd at fourscore,
     Engrave upon the plate, you rose at four.

     And Haidee met the morning face to face;
       Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush
     Had dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race
       From heart to cheek is curb'd into a blush,
     Like to a torrent which a mountain's base,
       That overpowers some Alpine river's rush,
     Checks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;
     Or the Red Sea--but the sea is not red.

     And down the cliff the island virgin came,
       And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,
     While the sun smiled on her with his first flame,
       And young Aurora kiss'd her lips with dew,
     Taking her for a sister; just the same
       Mistake you would have made on seeing the two,
     Although the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,
     Had all the advantage, too, of not being air.

     And when into the cavern Haidee stepp'd
       All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw
     That like an infant Juan sweetly slept;
       And then she stopp'd, and stood as if in awe
     (For sleep is awful), and on tiptoe crept
       And wrapt him closer, lest the air, too raw,
     Should reach his blood, then o'er him still as death
     Bent with hush'd lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath.

     And thus like to an angel o'er the dying
       Who die in righteousness, she lean'd; and there
     All tranquilly the shipwreck'd boy was lying,
       As o'er him the calm and stirless air:
     But Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,
       Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair
     Must breakfast--and betimes, lest they should ask it,
     She drew out her provision from the basket.

     She knew that the best feelings must have victual,
       And that a shipwreck'd youth would hungry be;
     Besides, being less in love, she yawn'd a little,
       And felt her veins chill'd by the neighbouring sea;
     And so, she cook'd their breakfast to a tittle;
       I can't say that she gave them any tea,
     But there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,
     With Scio wine,--and all for love, not money.

     And Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and
       The coffee made, would fain have waken'd Juan;
     But Haidee stopp'd her with her quick small hand,
       And without word, a sign her finger drew on
     Her lip, which Zoe needs must understand;
       And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,
     Because her mistress would not let her break
     That sleep which seem'd as it would ne'er awake.

     For still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek
       A purple hectic play'd like dying day
     On the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak
       Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,
     Where the blue veins look'd shadowy, shrunk, and weak;
       And his black curls were dewy with the spray,
     Which weigh'd upon them yet, all damp and salt,
     Mix'd with the stony vapours of the vault.

     And she bent o'er him, and he lay beneath,
       Hush'd as the babe upon its mother's breast,
     Droop'd as the willow when no winds can breathe,
       Lull'd like the depth of ocean when at rest,
     Fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath,
       Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest;
     In short, he was a very pretty fellow,
     Although his woes had turn'd him rather yellow.

     He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,
       But the fair face which met his eyes forbade
     Those eyes to close, though weariness and pain
       Had further sleep a further pleasure made;
     For woman's face was never form'd in vain
       For Juan, so that even when he pray'd
     He turn'd from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,
     To the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary.

     And thus upon his elbow he arose,
       And look'd upon the lady, in whose cheek
     The pale contended with the purple rose,
       As with an effort she began to speak;
     Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,
       Although she told him, in good modern Greek,
     With an Ionian accent, low and sweet,
     That he was faint, and must not talk, but eat.

     Now Juan could not understand a word,
       Being no Grecian; but he had an ear,
     And her voice was the warble of a bird,
       So soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,
     That finer, simpler music ne'er was heard;
       The sort of sound we echo with a tear,
     Without knowing why--an overpowering tone,
     Whence Melody descends as from a throne.

     And Juan gazed as one who is awoke
       By a distant organ, doubting if he be
     Not yet a dreamer, till the spell is broke
       By the watchman, or some such reality,
     Or by one's early valet's cursed knock;
       At least it is a heavy sound to me,
     Who like a morning slumber--for the night
     Shows stars and women in a better light.

     And Juan, too, was help'd out from his dream,
       Or sleep, or whatso'er it was, by feeling
     A most prodigious appetite: the steam
       Of Zoe's cookery no doubt was stealing
     Upon his senses, and the kindling beam
       Of the new fire, which Zoe kept up, kneeling
     To stir her viands, made him quite awake
     And long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak.

     But beef is rare within these oxless isles;
       Goat's flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton;
     And, when a holiday upon them smiles,
       A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:
     But this occurs but seldom, between whiles,
       For some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on;
     Others are fair and fertile, among which
     This, though not large, was one of the most rich.

     I say that beef is rare, and can't help thinking
       That the old fable of the Minotaur--
     From which our modern morals rightly shrinking
       Condemn the royal lady's taste who wore
     A cow's shape for a mask--was only (sinking
       The allegory) a mere type, no more,
     That Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,
     To make the Cretans bloodier in battle.

     For we all know that English people are
       Fed upon beef--I won't say much of beer,
     Because 't is liquor only, and being far
       From this my subject, has no business here;
     We know, too, they very fond of war,
       A pleasure--like all pleasures--rather dear;
     So were the Cretans--from which I infer
     That beef and battles both were owing to her.

     But to resume. The languid Juan raised
       His head upon his elbow, and he saw
     A sight on which he had not lately gazed,
       As all his latter meals had been quite raw,
     Three or four things, for which the Lord he praised,
       And, feeling still the famish'd vulture gnaw,
     He fell upon whate'er was offer'd, like
     A priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike.

     He ate, and he was well supplied: and she,
       Who watch'd him like a mother, would have fed
     Him past all bounds, because she smiled to see
       Such appetite in one she had deem'd dead;
     But Zoe, being older than Haidee,
       Knew (by tradition, for she ne'er had read)
     That famish'd people must be slowly nurst,
     And fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst.

     And so she took the liberty to state,
       Rather by deeds than words, because the case
     Was urgent, that the gentleman, whose fate
       Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace
     The sea-shore at this hour, must leave his plate,
       Unless he wish'd to die upon the place--
     She snatch'd it, and refused another morsel,
     Saying, he had gorged enough to make a horse ill.

     Next they--he being naked, save a tatter'd
       Pair of scarce decent trowsers--went to work,
     And in the fire his recent rags they scatter'd,
       And dress'd him, for the present, like a Turk,
     Or Greek--that is, although it not much matter'd,
       Omitting turban, slippers, pistols, dirk,--
     They furnish'd him, entire, except some stitches,
     With a clean shirt, and very spacious breeches.

     And then fair Haidee tried her tongue at speaking,
       But not a word could Juan comprehend,
     Although he listen'd so that the young Greek in
       Her earnestness would ne'er have made an end;
     And, as he interrupted not, went eking
       Her speech out to her protege and friend,
     Till pausing at the last her breath to take,
     She saw he did not understand Romaic.

     And then she had recourse to nods, and signs,
       And smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,
     And read (the only book she could) the lines
       Of his fair face, and found, by sympathy,
     The answer eloquent, where soul shines
       And darts in one quick glance a long reply;
     And thus in every look she saw exprest
     A world of words, and things at which she guess'd.

     And now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,
       And words repeated after her, he took
     A lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,
       No doubt, less of her language than her look:
     As he who studies fervently the skies
       Turns oftener to the stars than to his book,
     Thus Juan learn'd his alpha beta better
     From Haidee's glance than any graven letter.

     'T is pleasing to be school'd in a strange tongue
       By female lips and eyes--that is, I mean,
     When both the teacher and the taught are young,
       As was the case, at least, where I have been;
     They smile so when one 's right, and when one 's wrong
       They smile still more, and then there intervene
     Pressure of hands, perhaps even a chaste kiss;--
     I learn'd the little that I know by this:

     That is, some words of Spanish, Turk, and Greek,
       Italian not at all, having no teachers;
     Much English I cannot pretend to speak,
       Learning that language chiefly from its preachers,
     Barrow, South, Tillotson, whom every week
       I study, also Blair, the highest reachers
     Of eloquence in piety and prose--
     I hate your poets, so read none of those.

     As for the ladies, I have nought to say,
       A wanderer from the British world of fashion,
     Where I, like other 'dogs, have had my day,'
       Like other men, too, may have had my passion--
     But that, like other things, has pass'd away,
       And all her fools whom I could lay the lash on:
     Foes, friends, men, women, now are nought to me
     But dreams of what has been, no more to be.

     Return we to Don Juan. He begun
       To hear new words, and to repeat them; but
     Some feelings, universal as the sun,
       Were such as could not in his breast be shut
     More than within the bosom of a nun:
       He was in love,--as you would be, no doubt,
     With a young benefactress,--so was she,
     Just in the way we very often see.

     And every day by daybreak--rather early
       For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest--
     She came into the cave, but it was merely
       To see her bird reposing in his nest;
     And she would softly stir his locks so curly,
       Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,
     Breathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,
     As o'er a bed of roses the sweet south.

     And every morn his colour freshlier came,
       And every day help'd on his convalescence;
     'T was well, because health in the human frame
       Is pleasant, besides being true love's essence,
     For health and idleness to passion's flame
       Are oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons
     Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,
     Without whom Venus will not long attack us.

     While Venus fills the heart (without heart really
       Love, though good always, is not quite so good),
     Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli,--
       For love must be sustain'd like flesh and blood,--
     While Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly:
       Eggs, oysters, too, are amatory food;
     But who is their purveyor from above
     Heaven knows,--it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.

     When Juan woke he found some good things ready,
       A bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes
     That ever made a youthful heart less steady,
       Besides her maid's as pretty for their size;
     But I have spoken of all this already--
       And repetition 's tiresome and unwise,--
     Well--Juan, after bathing in the sea,
     Came always back to coffee and Haidee.

     Both were so young, and one so innocent,
       That bathing pass'd for nothing; Juan seem'd
     To her, as 'twere, the kind of being sent,
       Of whom these two years she had nightly dream'd,
     A something to be loved, a creature meant
       To be her happiness, and whom she deem'd
     To render happy; all who joy would win
     Must share it,--Happiness was born a twin.

     It was such pleasure to behold him, such
       Enlargement of existence to partake
     Nature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,
       To watch him slumbering, and to see him wake:
     To live with him forever were too much;
       But then the thought of parting made her quake;
     He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast
     Like a rich wreck--her first love, and her last.

     And thus a moon roll'd on, and fair Haidee
       Paid daily visits to her boy, and took
     Such plentiful precautions, that still he
       Remain'd unknown within his craggy nook;
     At last her father's prows put out to sea
       For certain merchantmen upon the look,
     Not as of yore to carry off an Io,
     But three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio.

     Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,
       So that, her father being at sea, she was
     Free as a married woman, or such other
       Female, as where she likes may freely pass,
     Without even the incumbrance of a brother,
       The freest she that ever gazed on glass;
     I speak of Christian lands in this comparison,
     Where wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison.

     Now she prolong'd her visits and her talk
       (For they must talk), and he had learnt to say
     So much as to propose to take a walk,--
       For little had he wander'd since the day
     On which, like a young flower snapp'd from the stalk,
       Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,--
     And thus they walk'd out in the afternoon,
     And saw the sun set opposite the moon.

     It was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,
       With cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,
     Guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,
       With here and there a creek, whose aspect wore
     A better welcome to the tempest-tost;
       And rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,
     Save on the dead long summer days, which make
     The outstretch'd ocean glitter like a lake.

     And the small ripple spilt upon the beach
       Scarcely o'erpass'd the cream of your champagne,
     When o'er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,
       That spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!
     Few things surpass old wine; and they may preach
       Who please,--the more because they preach in vain,--
     Let us have wine and women, mirth and laughter,
     Sermons and soda-water the day after.

     Man, being reasonable, must get drunk;
       The best of life is but intoxication:
     Glory, the grape, love, gold, in these are sunk
       The hopes of all men, and of every nation;
     Without their sap, how branchless were the trunk
       Of life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion:
     But to return,--Get very drunk; and when
     You wake with headache, you shall see what then.

     Ring for your valet--bid him quickly bring
       Some hock and soda-water, then you 'll know
     A pleasure worthy Xerxes the great king;
       For not the bless'd sherbet, sublimed with snow,
     Nor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,
       Nor Burgundy in all its sunset glow,
     After long travel, ennui, love, or slaughter,
     Vie with that draught of hock and soda-water.

     The coast--I think it was the coast that
       Was just describing--Yes, it was the coast--
     Lay at this period quiet as the sky,
       The sands untumbled, the blue waves untost,
     And all was stillness, save the sea-bird's cry,
       And dolphin's leap, and little billow crost
     By some low rock or shelve, that made it fret
     Against the boundary it scarcely wet.

     And forth they wander'd, her sire being gone,
       As I have said, upon an expedition;
     And mother, brother, guardian, she had none,
       Save Zoe, who, although with due precision
     She waited on her lady with the sun,
       Thought daily service was her only mission,
     Bringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,
     And asking now and then for cast-off dresses.

     It was the cooling hour, just when the rounded
       Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,
     Which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,
       Circling all nature, hush'd, and dim, and still,
     With the far mountain-crescent half surrounded
       On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill
     Upon the other, and the rosy sky,
     With one star sparkling through it like an eye.

     And thus they wander'd forth, and hand in hand,
       Over the shining pebbles and the shells,
     Glided along the smooth and harden'd sand,
       And in the worn and wild receptacles
     Work'd by the storms, yet work'd as it were plann'd,
       In hollow halls, with sparry roofs and cells,
     They turn'd to rest; and, each clasp'd by an arm,
     Yielded to the deep twilight's purple charm.

     They look'd up to the sky, whose floating glow
       Spread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;
     They gazed upon the glittering sea below,
       Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;
     They heard the wave's splash, and the wind so low,
       And saw each other's dark eyes darting light
     Into each other--and, beholding this,
     Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;

     A long, long kiss, a kiss of youth, and love,
       And beauty, all concentrating like rays
     Into one focus, kindled from above;
       Such kisses as belong to early days,
     Where heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move,
       And the blood 's lava, and the pulse a blaze,
     Each kiss a heart-quake,--for a kiss's strength,
     I think, it must be reckon'd by its length.

     By length I mean duration; theirs endured
       Heaven knows how long--no doubt they never reckon'd;
     And if they had, they could not have secured
       The sum of their sensations to a second:
     They had not spoken; but they felt allured,
       As if their souls and lips each other beckon'd,
     Which, being join'd, like swarming bees they clung--
     Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.

     They were alone, but not alone as they
       Who shut in chambers think it loneliness;
     The silent ocean, and the starlight bay,
       The twilight glow which momently grew less,
     The voiceless sands and dropping caves, that lay
       Around them, made them to each other press,
     As if there were no life beneath the sky
     Save theirs, and that their life could never die.

     They fear'd no eyes nor ears on that lone beach,
       They felt no terrors from the night, they were
     All in all to each other: though their speech
       Was broken words, they thought a language there,--
     And all the burning tongues the passions teach
       Found in one sigh the best interpreter
     Of nature's oracle--first love,--that all
     Which Eve has left her daughters since her fall.

     Haidde spoke not of scruples, ask'd no vows,
       Nor offer'd any; she had never heard
     Of plight and promises to be a spouse,
       Or perils by a loving maid incurr'd;
     She was all which pure ignorance allows,
       And flew to her young mate like a young bird;
     And, never having dreamt of falsehood, she
     Had not one word to say of constancy.

     She loved, and was beloved--she adored,
       And she was worshipp'd; after nature's fashion,
     Their intense souls, into each other pour'd,
       If souls could die, had perish'd in that passion,--
     But by degrees their senses were restored,
       Again to be o'ercome, again to dash on;
     And, beating 'gainst his bosom, Haidee's heart
     Felt as if never more to beat apart.

     Alas! they were so young, so beautiful,
       So lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour
     Was that in which the heart is always full,
       And, having o'er itself no further power,
     Prompts deeds eternity can not annul,
       But pays off moments in an endless shower
     Of hell-fire--all prepared for people giving
     Pleasure or pain to one another living.

     Alas! for Juan and Haidee! they were
       So loving and so lovely--till then never,
     Excepting our first parents, such a pair
       Had run the risk of being damn'd for ever;
     And Haidee, being devout as well as fair,
       Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,
     And hell and purgatory--but forgot
     Just in the very crisis she should not.

     They look upon each other, and their eyes
       Gleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps
     Round Juan's head, and his around her lies
       Half buried in the tresses which it grasps;
     She sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,
       He hers, until they end in broken gasps;
     And thus they form a group that 's quite antique,
     Half naked, loving, natural, and Greek.

     And when those deep and burning moments pass'd,
       And Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,
     She slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,
       Sustain'd his head upon her bosom's charms;
     And now and then her eye to heaven is cast,
       And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,
     Pillow'd on her o'erflowing heart, which pants
     With all it granted, and with all it grants.

     An infant when it gazes on a light,
       A child the moment when it drains the breast,
     A devotee when soars the Host in sight,
       An Arab with a stranger for a guest,
     A sailor when the prize has struck in fight,
       A miser filling his most hoarded chest,
     Feel rapture; but not such true joy are reaping
     As they who watch o'er what they love while sleeping.

     For there it lies so tranquil, so beloved,
       All that it hath of life with us is living;
     So gentle, stirless, helpless, and unmoved,
       And all unconscious of the joy 't is giving;
     All it hath felt, inflicted, pass'd, and proved,
       Hush'd into depths beyond the watcher's diving:
     There lies the thing we love with all its errors
     And all its charms, like death without its terrors.

     The lady watch'd her lover--and that hour
       Of Love's, and Night's, and Ocean's solitude,
     O'erflow'd her soul with their united power;
       Amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude
     She and her wave-worn love had made their bower,
       Where nought upon their passion could intrude,
     And all the stars that crowded the blue space
     Saw nothing happier than her glowing face.

     Alas! the love of women! it is known
       To be a lovely and a fearful thing;
     For all of theirs upon that die is thrown,
       And if 't is lost, life hath no more to bring
     To them but mockeries of the past alone,
       And their revenge is as the tiger's spring,
     Deadly, and quick, and crushing; yet, as real
     Torture is theirs, what they inflict they feel.

     They are right; for man, to man so oft unjust,
       Is always so to women; one sole bond
     Awaits them, treachery is all their trust;
       Taught to conceal, their bursting hearts despond
     Over their idol, till some wealthier lust
       Buys them in marriage--and what rests beyond?
     A thankless husband, next a faithless lover,
     Then dressing, nursing, praying, and all 's over.

     Some take a lover, some take drams or prayers,
       Some mind their household, others dissipation,
     Some run away, and but exchange their cares,
       Losing the advantage of a virtuous station;
     Few changes e'er can better their affairs,
       Theirs being an unnatural situation,
     From the dull palace to the dirty hovel:
     Some play the devil, and then write a novel.

     Haidee was Nature's bride, and knew not this;
       Haidee was Passion's child, born where the sun
     Showers triple light, and scorches even the kiss
       Of his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one
     Made but to love, to feel that she was his
       Who was her chosen: what was said or done
     Elsewhere was nothing. She had naught to fear,
     Hope, care, nor love, beyond, her heart beat here.

     And oh! that quickening of the heart, that beat!
       How much it costs us! yet each rising throb
     Is in its cause as its effect so sweet,
       That Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob
     Joy of its alchymy, and to repeat
       Fine truths; even Conscience, too, has a tough job
     To make us understand each good old maxim,
     So good--I wonder Castlereagh don't tax 'em.

     And now 't was done--on the lone shore were plighted
       Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed
     Beauty upon the beautiful they lighted:
       Ocean their witness, and the cave their bed,
     By their own feelings hallow'd and united,
       Their priest was Solitude, and they were wed:
     And they were happy, for to their young eyes
     Each was an angel, and earth paradise.

     O, Love! of whom great Caesar was the suitor,
       Titus the master, Antony the slave,
     Horace, Catullus, scholars, Ovid tutor,
       Sappho the sage blue-stocking, in whose grave
     All those may leap who rather would be neuter
       (Leucadia's rock still overlooks the wave)--
     O, Love! thou art the very god of evil,
     For, after all, we cannot call thee devil.

     Thou mak'st the chaste connubial state precarious,
       And jestest with the brows of mightiest men:
     Caesar and Pompey, Mahomet, Belisarius,
       Have much employ'd the muse of history's pen;
     Their lives and fortunes were extremely various,
       Such worthies Time will never see again;
     Yet to these four in three things the same luck holds,
     They all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.

     Thou mak'st philosophers; there 's Epicurus
       And Aristippus, a material crew!
     Who to immoral courses would allure us
       By theories quite practicable too;
     If only from the devil they would insure us,
       How pleasant were the maxim (not quite new),
     'Eat, drink, and love, what can the rest avail us?'
     So said the royal sage Sardanapalus.

     But Juan! had he quite forgotten Julia?
       And should he have forgotten her so soon?
     I can't but say it seems to me most truly
       Perplexing question; but, no doubt, the moon
     Does these things for us, and whenever newly
       Strong palpitation rises, 't is her boon,
     Else how the devil is it that fresh features
     Have such a charm for us poor human creatures?

     I hate inconstancy--I loathe, detest,
       Abhor, condemn, abjure the mortal made
     Of such quicksilver clay that in his breast
       No permanent foundation can be laid;
     Love, constant love, has been my constant guest,
       And yet last night, being at a masquerade,
     I saw the prettiest creature, fresh from Milan,
     Which gave me some sensations like a villain.

     But soon Philosophy came to my aid,
       And whisper'd, 'Think of every sacred tie!'
     'I will, my dear Philosophy!' I said,
       'But then her teeth, and then, oh, Heaven! her eye!
     I'll just inquire if she be wife or maid,
       Or neither--out of curiosity.'
     'Stop!' cried Philosophy, with air so Grecian
     (Though she was masqued then as a fair Venetian);

     'Stop!' so I stopp'd.--But to return: that which
       Men call inconstancy is nothing more
     Than admiration due where nature's rich
       Profusion with young beauty covers o'er
     Some favour'd object; and as in the niche
       A lovely statue we almost adore,
     This sort of adoration of the real
     Is but a heightening of the 'beau ideal.'

     'T is the perception of the beautiful,
       A fine extension of the faculties,
     Platonic, universal, wonderful,
       Drawn from the stars, and filter'd through the skies,
     Without which life would be extremely dull;
       In short, it is the use of our own eyes,
     With one or two small senses added, just
     To hint that flesh is form'd of fiery dust.

     Yet 't is a painful feeling, and unwilling,
       For surely if we always could perceive
     In the same object graces quite as killing
       As when she rose upon us like an Eve,
     'T would save us many a heartache, many a shilling
       (For we must get them any how or grieve),
     Whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,
     How pleasant for the heart as well as liver!

     The heart is like the sky, a part of heaven,
       But changes night and day, too, like the sky;
     Now o'er it clouds and thunder must be driven,
       And darkness and destruction as on high:
     But when it hath been scorch'd, and pierced, and riven,
       Its storms expire in water-drops; the eye
     Pours forth at last the heart's blood turn'd to tears,
     Which make the English climate of our years.

     The liver is the lazaret of bile,
       But very rarely executes its function,
     For the first passion stays there such a while,
       That all the rest creep in and form a junction,
     Life knots of vipers on a dunghill's soil,--
       Rage, fear, hate, jealousy, revenge, compunction,--
     So that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,
     Like earthquakes from the hidden fire call'd 'central,'

     In the mean time, without proceeding more
       In this anatomy, I 've finish'd now
     Two hundred and odd stanzas as before,
       That being about the number I 'll allow
     Each canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;
       And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,
     Leaving Don Juan and Haidee to plead
     For them and theirs with all who deign to read.

CANTO THE THIRD.

     Hail, Muse! et cetera.--We left Juan sleeping,
       Pillow'd upon a fair and happy breast,
     And watch'd by eyes that never yet knew weeping,
       And loved by a young heart, too deeply blest
     To feel the poison through her spirit creeping,
       Or know who rested there, a foe to rest,
     Had soil'd the current of her sinless years,
     And turn'd her pure heart's purest blood to tears!

     O, Love! what is it in this world of ours
       Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah, why
     With cypress branches hast thou Wreathed thy bowers,
       And made thy best interpreter a sigh?
     As those who dote on odours pluck the flowers,
       And place them on their breast--but place to die--
     Thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish
     Are laid within our bosoms but to perish.

     In her first passion woman loves her lover,
       In all the others all she loves is love,
     Which grows a habit she can ne'er get over,
       And fits her loosely--like an easy glove,
     As you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:
       One man alone at first her heart can move;
     She then prefers him in the plural number,
     Not finding that the additions much encumber.

     I know not if the fault be men's or theirs;
       But one thing 's pretty sure; a woman planted
     (Unless at once she plunge for life in prayers)
       After a decent time must be gallanted;
     Although, no doubt, her first of love affairs
       Is that to which her heart is wholly granted;
     Yet there are some, they say, who have had none,
     But those who have ne'er end with only one.

     'T is melancholy, and a fearful sign
       Of human frailty, folly, also crime,
     That love and marriage rarely can combine,
       Although they both are born in the same clime;
     Marriage from love, like vinegar from wine--
       A sad, sour, sober beverage--by time
     Is sharpen'd from its high celestial flavour
     Down to a very homely household savour.

     There 's something of antipathy, as 't were,
       Between their present and their future state;
     A kind of flattery that 's hardly fair
       Is used until the truth arrives too late--
     Yet what can people do, except despair?
       The same things change their names at such a rate;
     For instance--passion in a lover 's glorious,
     But in a husband is pronounced uxorious.

     Men grow ashamed of being so very fond;
       They sometimes also get a little tired
     (But that, of course, is rare), and then despond:
       The same things cannot always be admired,
     Yet 't is 'so nominated in the bond,'
       That both are tied till one shall have expired.
     Sad thought! to lose the spouse that was adorning
     Our days, and put one's servants into mourning.

     There 's doubtless something in domestic doings
       Which forms, in fact, true love's antithesis;
     Romances paint at full length people's wooings,
       But only give a bust of marriages;
     For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,
       There 's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:
     Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,
     He would have written sonnets all his life?

     All tragedies are finish'd by a death,
       All comedies are ended by a marriage;
     The future states of both are left to faith,
       For authors fear description might disparage
     The worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,
       And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;
     So leaving each their priest and prayer-book ready,
     They say no more of Death or of the Lady.

     The only two that in my recollection
       Have sung of heaven and hell, or marriage, are
     Dante and Milton, and of both the affection
       Was hapless in their nuptials, for some bar
     Of fault or temper ruin'd the connection
       (Such things, in fact, it don't ask much to mar):
     But Dante's Beatrice and Milton's Eve
     Were not drawn from their spouses, you conceive.

     Some persons say that Dante meant theology
       By Beatrice, and not a mistress--I,
     Although my opinion may require apology,
       Deem this a commentator's fantasy,
     Unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he
       Decided thus, and show'd good reason why;
     I think that Dante's more abstruse ecstatics
     Meant to personify the mathematics.

     Haidee and Juan were not married, but
       The fault was theirs, not mine; it is not fair,
     Chaste reader, then, in any way to put
       The blame on me, unless you wish they were;
     Then if you 'd have them wedded, please to shut
       The book which treats of this erroneous pair,
     Before the consequences grow too awful;
     'T is dangerous to read of loves unlawful.

     Yet they were happy,--happy in the illicit
       Indulgence of their innocent desires;
     But more imprudent grown with every visit,
       Haidee forgot the island was her sire's;
     When we have what we like, 't is hard to miss it,
       At least in the beginning, ere one tires;
     Thus she came often, not a moment losing,
     Whilst her piratical papa was cruising.

     Let not his mode of raising cash seem strange,
       Although he fleeced the flags of every nation,
     For into a prime minister but change
       His title, and 't is nothing but taxation;
     But he, more modest, took an humbler range
       Of life, and in an honester vocation
     Pursued o'er the high seas his watery journey,
     And merely practised as a sea-attorney.

     The good old gentleman had been detain'd
       By winds and waves, and some important captures;
     And, in the hope of more, at sea remain'd,
       Although a squall or two had damp'd his raptures,
     By swamping one of the prizes; he had chain'd
       His prisoners, dividing them like chapters
     In number'd lots; they all had cuffs and collars,
     And averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars.

     Some he disposed of off Cape Matapan,
       Among his friends the Mainots; some he sold
     To his Tunis correspondents, save one man
       Toss'd overboard unsaleable (being old);
     The rest--save here and there some richer one,
       Reserved for future ransom--in the hold
     Were link'd alike, as for the common people he
     Had a large order from the Dey of Tripoli.

     The merchandise was served in the same way,
       Pieced out for different marts in the Levant;
     Except some certain portions of the prey,
       Light classic articles of female want,
     French stuffs, lace, tweezers, toothpicks, teapot, tray,
       Guitars and castanets from Alicant,
     All which selected from the spoil he gathers,
     Robb'd for his daughter by the best of fathers.

     A monkey, a Dutch mastiff, a mackaw,
       Two parrots, with a Persian cat and kittens,
     He chose from several animals he saw--
       A terrier, too, which once had been a Briton's,
     Who dying on the coast of Ithaca,
       The peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance;
     These to secure in this strong blowing weather,
     He caged in one huge hamper altogether.

     Then having settled his marine affairs,
       Despatching single cruisers here and there,
     His vessel having need of some repairs,
       He shaped his course to where his daughter fair
     Continued still her hospitable cares;
       But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,
     And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,
     His port lay on the other side o' the isle.

     And there he went ashore without delay,
       Having no custom-house nor quarantine
     To ask him awkward questions on the way
       About the time and place where he had been:
     He left his ship to be hove down next day,
       With orders to the people to careen;
     So that all hands were busy beyond measure,
     In getting out goods, ballast, guns, and treasure.

     Arriving at the summit of a hill
       Which overlook'd the white walls of his home,
     He stopp'd.--What singular emotions fill
       Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!
     With fluttering doubts if all be well or ill--
       With love for many, and with fears for some;
     All feelings which o'erleap the years long lost,
     And bring our hearts back to their starting-post.

     The approach of home to husbands and to sires,
       After long travelling by land or water,
     Most naturally some small doubt inspires--
       A female family 's a serious matter
     (None trusts the sex more, or so much admires--
       But they hate flattery, so I never flatter);
     Wives in their husbands' absences grow subtler,
     And daughters sometimes run off with the butler.

     An honest gentleman at his return
       May not have the good fortune of Ulysses;
     Not all lone matrons for their husbands mourn,
       Or show the same dislike to suitors' kisses;
     The odds are that he finds a handsome urn
       To his memory--and two or three young misses
     Born to some friend, who holds his wife and riches,--
     And that his Argus--bites him by the breeches.

     If single, probably his plighted fair
       Has in his absence wedded some rich miser;
     But all the better, for the happy pair
       May quarrel, and the lady growing wiser,
     He may resume his amatory care
       As cavalier servente, or despise her;
     And that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,
     Write odes on the Inconstancy of Woman.

     And oh! ye gentlemen who have already
       Some chaste liaison of the kind--I mean
     An honest friendship with a married lady--
       The only thing of this sort ever seen
     To last--of all connections the most steady,
       And the true Hymen (the first 's but a screen)--
     Yet for all that keep not too long away,
     I 've known the absent wrong'd four times a day.

     Lambro, our sea-solicitor, who had
       Much less experience of dry land than ocean,
     On seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;
       But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion
     Of the true reason of his not being sad,
       Or that of any other strong emotion;
     He loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,
     But knew the cause no more than a philosopher.

     He saw his white walls shining in the sun,
       His garden trees all shadowy and green;
     He heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,
       The distant dog-bark; and perceived between
     The umbrage of the wood so cool and dun
       The moving figures, and the sparkling sheen
     Of arms (in the East all arm)--and various dyes
     Of colour'd garbs, as bright as butterflies.

     And as the spot where they appear he nears,
       Surprised at these unwonted signs of idling,
     He hears--alas! no music of the spheres,
       But an unhallow'd, earthly sound of fiddling!
     A melody which made him doubt his ears,
       The cause being past his guessing or unriddling;
     A pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after,
     A most unoriental roar of laughter.

     And still more nearly to the place advancing,
       Descending rather quickly the declivity,
     Through the waved branches o'er the greensward glancing,
       'Midst other indications of festivity,
     Seeing a troop of his domestics dancing
       Like dervises, who turn as on a pivot, he
     Perceived it was the Pyrrhic dance so martial,
     To which the Levantines are very partial.

     And further on a group of Grecian girls,
       The first and tallest her white kerchief waving,
     Were strung together like a row of pearls,
       Link'd hand in hand, and dancing; each too having
     Down her white neck long floating auburn curls
       (The least of which would set ten poets raving);
     Their leader sang--and bounded to her song,
     With choral step and voice, the virgin throng.

     And here, assembled cross-legg'd round their trays,
       Small social parties just begun to dine;
     Pilaus and meats of all sorts met the gaze,
       And flasks of Samian and of Chian wine,
     And sherbet cooling in the porous vase;
       Above them their dessert grew on its vine,
     The orange and pomegranate nodding o'er
     Dropp'd in their laps, scarce pluck'd, their mellow store.

     A band of children, round a snow-white ram,
       There wreathe his venerable horns with flowers;
     While peaceful as if still an unwean'd lamb,
       The patriarch of the flock all gently cowers
     His sober head, majestically tame,
       Or eats from out the palm, or playful lowers
     His brow, as if in act to butt, and then
     Yielding to their small hands, draws back again.

     Their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,
       Their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,
     Crimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,
       The gesture which enchants, the eye that speaks,
     The innocence which happy childhood blesses,
       Made quite a picture of these little Greeks;
     So that the philosophical beholder
     Sigh'd for their sakes--that they should e'er grow older.

     Afar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales
       To a sedate grey circle of old smokers,
     Of secret treasures found in hidden vales,
       Of wonderful replies from Arab jokers,
     Of charms to make good gold and cure bad ails,
       Of rocks bewitch'd that open to the knockers,
     Of magic ladies who, by one sole act,
     Transform'd their lords to beasts (but that 's a fact).

     Here was no lack of innocent diversion
       For the imagination or the senses,
     Song, dance, wine, music, stories from the Persian,
       All pretty pastimes in which no offence is;
     But Lambro saw all these things with aversion,
       Perceiving in his absence such expenses,
     Dreading that climax of all human ills,
     The inflammation of his weekly bills.

     Ah! what is man? what perils still environ
       The happiest mortals even after dinner--
     A day of gold from out an age of iron
       Is all that life allows the luckiest sinner;
     Pleasure (whene'er she sings, at least) 's a siren,
       That lures, to flay alive, the young beginner;
     Lambro's reception at his people's banquet
     Was such as fire accords to a wet blanket.

     He--being a man who seldom used a word
       Too much, and wishing gladly to surprise
     (In general he surprised men with the sword)
       His daughter--had not sent before to advise
     Of his arrival, so that no one stirr'd;
       And long he paused to re-assure his eyes
     In fact much more astonish'd than delighted,
     To find so much good company invited.

     He did not know (alas! how men will lie)
       That a report (especially the Greeks)
     Avouch'd his death (such people never die),
       And put his house in mourning several weeks,--
     But now their eyes and also lips were dry;
       The bloom, too, had return'd to Haidee's cheeks,
     Her tears, too, being return'd into their fount,
     She now kept house upon her own account.

     Hence all this rice, meat, dancing, wine, and fiddling,
       Which turn'd the isle into a place of pleasure;
     The servants all were getting drunk or idling,
       A life which made them happy beyond measure.
     Her father's hospitality seem'd middling,
       Compared with what Haidee did with his treasure;
     'T was wonderful how things went on improving,
     While she had not one hour to spare from loving.

     Perhaps you think in stumbling on this feast
       He flew into a passion, and in fact
     There was no mighty reason to be pleased;
       Perhaps you prophesy some sudden act,
     The whip, the rack, or dungeon at the least,
       To teach his people to be more exact,
     And that, proceeding at a very high rate,
     He show'd the royal penchants of a pirate.

     You 're wrong.--He was the mildest manner'd man
       That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat:
     With such true breeding of a gentleman,
       You never could divine his real thought;
     No courtier could, and scarcely woman can
       Gird more deceit within a petticoat;
     Pity he loved adventurous life's variety,
     He was so great a loss to good society.

     Advancing to the nearest dinner tray,
       Tapping the shoulder of the nighest guest,
     With a peculiar smile, which, by the way,
       Boded no good, whatever it express'd,
     He ask'd the meaning of this holiday;
       The vinous Greek to whom he had address'd
     His question, much too merry to divine
     The questioner, fill'd up a glass of wine,

     And without turning his facetious head,
       Over his shoulder, with a Bacchant air,
     Presented the o'erflowing cup, and said,
       'Talking 's dry work, I have no time to spare.'
     A second hiccup'd, 'Our old master 's dead,
       You 'd better ask our mistress who 's his heir.'
     'Our mistress!' quoth a third: 'Our mistress!--pooh!-
     You mean our master--not the old, but new.'

     These rascals, being new comers, knew not whom
       They thus address'd--and Lambro's visage fell--
     And o'er his eye a momentary gloom
       Pass'd, but he strove quite courteously to quell
     The expression, and endeavouring to resume
       His smile, requested one of them to tell
     The name and quality of his new patron,
     Who seem'd to have turn'd Haidee into a matron.

     'I know not,' quoth the fellow, 'who or what
       He is, nor whence he came--and little care;
     But this I know, that this roast capon 's fat,
       And that good wine ne'er wash'd down better fare;
     And if you are not satisfied with that,
       Direct your questions to my neighbour there;
     He 'll answer all for better or for worse,
     For none likes more to hear himself converse.'

     I said that Lambro was a man of patience,
       And certainly he show'd the best of breeding,
     Which scarce even France, the paragon of nations,
       E'er saw her most polite of sons exceeding;
     He bore these sneers against his near relations,
       His own anxiety, his heart, too, bleeding,
     The insults, too, of every servile glutton,
     Who all the time was eating up his mutton.

     Now in a person used to much command--
       To bid men come, and go, and come again--
     To see his orders done, too, out of hand--
       Whether the word was death, or but the chain--
     It may seem strange to find his manners bland;
       Yet such things are, which I can not explain,
     Though doubtless he who can command himself
     Is good to govern--almost as a Guelf.

     Not that he was not sometimes rash or so,
       But never in his real and serious mood;
     Then calm, concentrated, and still, and slow,
       He lay coil'd like the boa in the wood;
     With him it never was a word and blow,
       His angry word once o'er, he shed no blood,
     But in his silence there was much to rue,
     And his one blow left little work for two.

     He ask'd no further questions, and proceeded
       On to the house, but by a private way,
     So that the few who met him hardly heeded,
       So little they expected him that day;
     If love paternal in his bosom pleaded
       For Haidee's sake, is more than I can say,
     But certainly to one deem'd dead, returning,
     This revel seem'd a curious mode of mourning.

     If all the dead could now return to life
       (Which God forbid!) or some, or a great many,
     For instance, if a husband or his wife
       (Nuptial examples are as good as any),
     No doubt whate'er might be their former strife,
       The present weather would be much more rainy--
     Tears shed into the grave of the connection
     Would share most probably its resurrection.

     He enter'd in the house no more his home,
       A thing to human feelings the most trying,
     And harder for the heart to overcome,
       Perhaps, than even the mental pangs of dying;
     To find our hearthstone turn'd into a tomb,
       And round its once warm precincts palely lying
     The ashes of our hopes, is a deep grief,
     Beyond a single gentleman's belief.

     He enter'd in the house--his home no more,
       For without hearts there is no home; and felt
     The solitude of passing his own door
       Without a welcome; there he long had dwelt,
     There his few peaceful days Time had swept o'er,
       There his worn bosom and keen eye would melt
     Over the innocence of that sweet child,
     His only shrine of feelings undefiled.

     He was a man of a strange temperament,
       Of mild demeanour though of savage mood,
     Moderate in all his habits, and content
       With temperance in pleasure, as in food,
     Quick to perceive, and strong to bear, and meant
       For something better, if not wholly good;
     His country's wrongs and his despair to save her
     Had stung him from a slave to an enslaver.

     The love of power, and rapid gain of gold,
       The hardness by long habitude produced,
     The dangerous life in which he had grown old,
       The mercy he had granted oft abused,
     The sights he was accustom'd to behold,
       The wild seas, and wild men with whom he cruised,
     Had cost his enemies a long repentance,
     And made him a good friend, but bad acquaintance.

     But something of the spirit of old Greece
       Flash'd o'er his soul a few heroic rays,
     Such as lit onward to the Golden Fleece
       His predecessors in the Colchian days;
     T is true he had no ardent love for peace--
       Alas! his country show'd no path to praise:
     Hate to the world and war with every nation
     He waged, in vengeance of her degradation.

     Still o'er his mind the influence of the clime
       Shed its Ionian elegance, which show'd
     Its power unconsciously full many a time,--
       A taste seen in the choice of his abode,
     A love of music and of scenes sublime,
       A pleasure in the gentle stream that flow'd
     Past him in crystal, and a joy in flowers,
     Bedew'd his spirit in his calmer hours.

     But whatsoe'er he had of love reposed
       On that beloved daughter; she had been
     The only thing which kept his heart unclosed
       Amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen;
     A lonely pure affection unopposed:
       There wanted but the loss of this to wean
     His feelings from all milk of human kindness,
     And turn him like the Cyclops mad with blindness.

     The cubless tigress in her jungle raging
       Is dreadful to the shepherd and the flock;
     The ocean when its yeasty war is waging
       Is awful to the vessel near the rock;
     But violent things will sooner bear assuaging,
       Their fury being spent by its own shock,
     Than the stern, single, deep, and wordless ire
     Of a strong human heart, and in a sire.

     It is a hard although a common case
       To find our children running restive--they
     In whom our brightest days we would retrace,
       Our little selves re-form'd in finer clay,
     Just as old age is creeping on apace,
       And clouds come o'er the sunset of our day,
     They kindly leave us, though not quite alone,
     But in good company--the gout or stone.

     Yet a fine family is a fine thing
       (Provided they don't come in after dinner);
     'T is beautiful to see a matron bring
       Her children up (if nursing them don't thin her);
     Like cherubs round an altar-piece they cling
       To the fire-side (a sight to touch a sinner).
     A lady with her daughters or her nieces
     Shines like a guinea and seven-shilling pieces.

     Old Lambro pass'd unseen a private gate,
       And stood within his hall at eventide;
     Meantime the lady and her lover sate
       At wassail in their beauty and their pride:
     An ivory inlaid table spread with state
       Before them, and fair slaves on every side;
     Gems, gold, and silver, form'd the service mostly,
     Mother of pearl and coral the less costly.

     The dinner made about a hundred dishes;
       Lamb and pistachio nuts--in short, all meats,
     And saffron soups, and sweetbreads; and the fishes
       Were of the finest that e'er flounced in nets,
     Drest to a Sybarite's most pamper'd wishes;
       The beverage was various sherbets
     Of raisin, orange, and pomegranate juice,
     Squeezed through the rind, which makes it best for use.

     These were ranged round, each in its crystal ewer,
       And fruits, and date-bread loaves closed the repast,
     And Mocha's berry, from Arabia pure,
       In small fine China cups, came in at last;
     Gold cups of filigree made to secure
       The hand from burning underneath them placed,
     Cloves, cinnamon, and saffron too were boil'd
     Up with the coffee, which (I think) they spoil'd.

     The hangings of the room were tapestry, made
       Of velvet panels, each of different hue,
     And thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid;
       And round them ran a yellow border too;
     The upper border, richly wrought, display'd,
       Embroider'd delicately o'er with blue,
     Soft Persian sentences, in lilac letters,
     From poets, or the moralists their betters.

     These Oriental writings on the wall,
       Quite common in those countries, are a kind
     Of monitors adapted to recall,
       Like skulls at Memphian banquets, to the mind
     The words which shook Belshazzar in his hall,
       And took his kingdom from him: You will find,
     Though sages may pour out their wisdom's treasure,
     There is no sterner moralist than Pleasure.

     A beauty at the season's close grown hectic,
       A genius who has drunk himself to death,
     A rake turn'd methodistic, or Eclectic
       (For that 's the name they like to pray beneath)--
     But most, an alderman struck apoplectic,
       Are things that really take away the breath,--
     And show that late hours, wine, and love are able
     To do not much less damage than the table.

     Haidee and Juan carpeted their feet
       On crimson satin, border'd with pale blue;
     Their sofa occupied three parts complete
       Of the apartment--and appear'd quite new;
     The velvet cushions (for a throne more meet)
       Were scarlet, from whose glowing centre grew
     A sun emboss'd in gold, whose rays of tissue,
     Meridian-like, were seen all light to issue.

     Crystal and marble, plate and porcelain,
       Had done their work of splendour; Indian mats
     And Persian carpets, which the heart bled to stain,
       Over the floors were spread; gazelles and cats,
     And dwarfs and blacks, and such like things, that gain
       Their bread as ministers and favourites (that 's
     To say, by degradation) mingled there
     As plentiful as in a court, or fair.

     There was no want of lofty mirrors, and
       The tables, most of ebony inlaid
     With mother of pearl or ivory, stood at hand,
       Or were of tortoise-shell or rare woods made,
     Fretted with gold or silver:--by command,
       The greater part of these were ready spread
     With viands and sherbets in ice--and wine--
     Kept for all comers at all hours to dine.

     Of all the dresses I select Haidee's:
       She wore two jelicks--one was of pale yellow;
     Of azure, pink, and white was her chemise--
       'Neath which her breast heaved like a little billow;
     With buttons form'd of pearls as large as peas,
       All gold and crimson shone her jelick's fellow,
     And the striped white gauze baracan that bound her,
     Like fleecy clouds about the moon, flow'd round her.

     One large gold bracelet clasp'd each lovely arm,
       Lockless--so pliable from the pure gold
     That the hand stretch'd and shut it without harm,
       The limb which it adorn'd its only mould;
     So beautiful--its very shape would charm;
       And, clinging as if loath to lose its hold,
     The purest ore enclosed the whitest skin
     That e'er by precious metal was held in.

     Around, as princess of her father's land,
       A like gold bar above her instep roll'd
     Announced her rank; twelve rings were on her hand;
       Her hair was starr'd with gems; her veil's fine fold
     Below her breast was fasten'd with a band
       Of lavish pearls, whose worth could scarce be told;
     Her orange silk full Turkish trousers furl'd
     About the prettiest ankle in the world.

     Her hair's long auburn waves down to her heel
       Flow'd like an Alpine torrent which the sun
     Dyes with his morning light,--and would conceal
       Her person if allow'd at large to run,
     And still they seem resentfully to feel
       The silken fillet's curb, and sought to shun
     Their bonds whene'er some Zephyr caught began
     To offer his young pinion as her fan.

     Round her she made an atmosphere of life,
       The very air seem'd lighter from her eyes,
     They were so soft and beautiful, and rife
       With all we can imagine of the skies,
     And pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife--
       Too pure even for the purest human ties;
     Her overpowering presence made you feel
     It would not be idolatry to kneel.

     Her eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged
       (It is the country's custom), but in vain;
     For those large black eyes were so blackly fringed,
       The glossy rebels mock'd the jetty stain,
     And in their native beauty stood avenged:
       Her nails were touch'd with henna; but again
     The power of art was turn'd to nothing, for
     They could not look more rosy than before.

     The henna should be deeply dyed to make
       The skin relieved appear more fairly fair;
     She had no need of this, day ne'er will break
       On mountain tops more heavenly white than her:
     The eye might doubt if it were well awake,
       She was so like a vision; I might err,
     But Shakspeare also says, 't is very silly
     'To gild refined gold, or paint the lily'

     Juan had on a shawl of black and gold,
       But a white baracan, and so transparent
     The sparkling gems beneath you might behold,
       Like small stars through the milky way apparent;
     His turban, furl'd in many a graceful fold,
       An emerald aigrette with Haidee's hair in 't
     Surmounted as its clasp--a glowing crescent,
     Whose rays shone ever trembling, but incessant.

     And now they were diverted by their suite,
       Dwarfs, dancing girls, black eunuchs, and a poet,
     Which made their new establishment complete;
       The last was of great fame, and liked to show it:
     His verses rarely wanted their due feet;
       And for his theme--he seldom sung below it,
     He being paid to satirize or flatter,
     As the psalm says, 'inditing a good matter.'

     He praised the present, and abused the past,
       Reversing the good custom of old days,
     An Eastern anti-jacobin at last
       He turn'd, preferring pudding to no praise--
     For some few years his lot had been o'ercast
       By his seeming independent in his lays,
     But now he sung the Sultan and the Pacha
     With truth like Southey, and with verse like Crashaw.

     He was a man who had seen many changes,
       And always changed as true as any needle;
     His polar star being one which rather ranges,
       And not the fix'd--he knew the way to wheedle:
     So vile he 'scaped the doom which oft avenges;
       And being fluent (save indeed when fee'd ill),
     He lied with such a fervour of intention--
     There was no doubt he earn'd his laureate pension.

     But he had genius,--when a turncoat has it,
       The 'Vates irritabilis' takes care
     That without notice few full moons shall pass it;
       Even good men like to make the public stare:--
     But to my subject--let me see--what was it?-
       O!--the third canto--and the pretty pair--
     Their loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode
     Of living in their insular abode.

     Their poet, a sad trimmer, but no less
       In company a very pleasant fellow,
     Had been the favourite of full many a mess
       Of men, and made them speeches when half mellow;
     And though his meaning they could rarely guess,
       Yet still they deign'd to hiccup or to bellow
     The glorious meed of popular applause,
     Of which the first ne'er knows the second cause.

     But now being lifted into high society,
       And having pick'd up several odds and ends
     Of free thoughts in his travels for variety,
       He deem'd, being in a lone isle, among friends,
     That, without any danger of a riot, he
       Might for long lying make himself amends;
     And, singing as he sung in his warm youth,
     Agree to a short armistice with truth.

     He had travell'd 'mongst the Arabs, Turks, and Franks,
       And knew the self-loves of the different nations;
     And having lived with people of all ranks,
       Had something ready upon most occasions--
     Which got him a few presents and some thanks.
       He varied with some skill his adulations;
     To 'do at Rome as Romans do,' a piece
     Of conduct was which he observed in Greece.

     Thus, usually, when he was ask'd to sing,
       He gave the different nations something national;
     'T was all the same to him--'God save the king,'
       Or 'Ca ira,' according to the fashion all:
     His muse made increment of any thing,
       From the high lyric down to the low rational:
     If Pindar sang horse-races, what should hinder
     Himself from being as pliable as Pindar?

     In France, for instance, he would write a chanson;
       In England a six canto quarto tale;
     In Spain, he'd make a ballad or romance on
       The last war--much the same in Portugal;
     In Germany, the Pegasus he 'd prance on
       Would be old Goethe's (see what says De Stael);
     In Italy he 'd ape the 'Trecentisti;'
     In Greece, he sing some sort of hymn like this t' ye:

                     THE ISLES OF GREECE.

           The isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece!
             Where burning Sappho loved and sung,
           Where grew the arts of war and peace,
             Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!
           Eternal summer gilds them yet,
           But all, except their sun, is set.

           The Scian and the Teian muse,
             The hero's harp, the lover's lute,
           Have found the fame your shores refuse;
             Their place of birth alone is mute
           To sounds which echo further west
           Than your sires' 'Islands of the Blest.'

           The mountains look on Marathon--
             And Marathon looks on the sea;
           And musing there an hour alone,
             I dream'd that Greece might still be free;
           For standing on the Persians' grave,
           I could not deem myself a slave.

           A king sate on the rocky brow
             Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;
           And ships, by thousands, lay below,
             And men in nations;--all were his!
           He counted them at break of day--
           And when the sun set where were they?

           And where are they? and where art thou,
             My country? On thy voiceless shore
           The heroic lay is tuneless now--
             The heroic bosom beats no more!
           And must thy lyre, so long divine,
           Degenerate into hands like mine?

           'T is something, in the dearth of fame,
             Though link'd among a fetter'd race,
           To feel at least a patriot's shame,
             Even as I sing, suffuse my face;
           For what is left the poet here?
           For Greeks a blush--for Greece a tear.

           Must we but weep o'er days more blest?
             Must we but blush?--Our fathers bled.
           Earth! render back from out thy breast
             A remnant of our Spartan dead!
           Of the three hundred grant but three,
           To make a new Thermopylae!

           What, silent still? and silent all?
             Ah! no;--the voices of the dead
           Sound like a distant torrent's fall,
             And answer, 'Let one living head,
           But one arise,--we come, we come!'
           'T is but the living who are dumb.

           In vain--in vain: strike other chords;
             Fill high the cup with Samian wine!
           Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,
             And shed the blood of Scio's vine!
           Hark! rising to the ignoble call--
           How answers each bold Bacchanal!

           You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet,
             Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?
           Of two such lessons, why forget
             The nobler and the manlier one?
           You have the letters Cadmus gave--
           Think ye he meant them for a slave?

           Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
             We will not think of themes like these!
           It made Anacreon's song divine:
             He served--but served Polycrates--
           A tyrant; but our masters then
           Were still, at least, our countrymen.

           The tyrant of the Chersonese
             Was freedom's best and bravest friend;
           That tyrant was Miltiades!
             O! that the present hour would lend
           Another despot of the kind!
           Such chains as his were sure to bind.

           Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
             On Suli's rock, and Parga's shore,
           Exists the remnant of a line
             Such as the Doric mothers bore;
           And there, perhaps, some seed is sown,
           The Heracleidan blood might own.

           Trust not for freedom to the Franks--
             They have a king who buys and sells;
           In native swords, and native ranks,
             The only hope of courage dwells;
           But Turkish force, and Latin fraud,
           Would break your shield, however broad.

           Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
             Our virgins dance beneath the shade--
           I see their glorious black eyes shine;
             But gazing on each glowing maid,
           My own the burning tear-drop laves,
           To think such breasts must suckle slaves

           Place me on Sunium's marbled steep,
             Where nothing, save the waves and I,
           May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;
             There, swan-like, let me sing and die:
           A land of slaves shall ne'er be mine--
           Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!

     Thus sung, or would, or could, or should have sung,
       The modern Greek, in tolerable verse;
     If not like Orpheus quite, when Greece was young,
       Yet in these times he might have done much worse:
     His strain display'd some feeling--right or wrong;
       And feeling, in a poet, is the source
     Of others' feeling; but they are such liars,
     And take all colours--like the hands of dyers.

     But words are things, and a small drop of ink,
       Falling like dew, upon a thought, produces
     That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think;
       'T is strange, the shortest letter which man uses
     Instead of speech, may form a lasting link
       Of ages; to what straits old Time reduces
     Frail man, when paper--even a rag like this,
     Survives himself, his tomb, and all that 's his.

     And when his bones are dust, his grave a blank,
       His station, generation, even his nation,
     Become a thing, or nothing, save to rank
       In chronological commemoration,
     Some dull MS. oblivion long has sank,
       Or graven stone found in a barrack's station
     In digging the foundation of a closet,
     May turn his name up, as a rare deposit.

     And glory long has made the sages smile;
       'T is something, nothing, words, illusion, wind--
     Depending more upon the historian's style
       Than on the name a person leaves behind:
     Troy owes to Homer what whist owes to Hoyle:
       The present century was growing blind
     To the great Marlborough's skill in giving knocks,
     Until his late life by Archdeacon Coxe.

     Milton 's the prince of poets--so we say;
       A little heavy, but no less divine:
     An independent being in his day--
       Learn'd, pious, temperate in love and wine;
     But, his life falling into Johnson's way,
       We 're told this great high priest of all the Nine
     Was whipt at college--a harsh sire--odd spouse,
     For the first Mrs. Milton left his house.

     All these are, certes, entertaining facts,
       Like Shakspeare's stealing deer, Lord Bacon's bribes;
     Like Titus' youth, and Caesar's earliest acts;
       Like Burns (whom Doctor Currie well describes);
     Like Cromwell's pranks;--but although truth exacts
       These amiable descriptions from the scribes,
     As most essential to their hero's story,
     They do not much contribute to his glory.

     All are not moralists, like Southey, when
       He prated to the world of 'Pantisocracy;'
     Or Wordsworth unexcised, unhired, who then
       Season'd his pedlar poems with democracy;
     Or Coleridge, long before his flighty pen
       Let to the Morning Post its aristocracy;
     When he and Southey, following the same path,
     Espoused two partners (milliners of Bath).

     Such names at present cut a convict figure,
       The very Botany Bay in moral geography;
     Their loyal treason, renegado rigour,
       Are good manure for their more bare biography.
     Wordsworth's last quarto, by the way, is bigger
       Than any since the birthday of typography;
     A drowsy frowzy poem, call'd the 'Excursion.'
     Writ in a manner which is my aversion.

     He there builds up a formidable dyke
       Between his own and others' intellect;
     But Wordsworth's poem, and his followers, like
       Joanna Southcote's Shiloh, and her sect,
     Are things which in this century don't strike
       The public mind,--so few are the elect;
     And the new births of both their stale virginities
     Have proved but dropsies, taken for divinities.

     But let me to my story: I must own,
       If I have any fault, it is digression--
     Leaving my people to proceed alone,
       While I soliloquize beyond expression;
     But these are my addresses from the throne,
       Which put off business to the ensuing session:
     Forgetting each omission is a loss to
     The world, not quite so great as Ariosto.

     I know that what our neighbours call 'longueurs'
       (We 've not so good a word, but have the thing
     In that complete perfection which ensures
       An epic from Bob Southey every spring),
     Form not the true temptation which allures
       The reader; but 't would not be hard to bring
     Some fine examples of the epopee,
     To prove its grand ingredient is ennui.

     We learn from Horace, 'Homer sometimes sleeps;'
       We feel without him, Wordsworth sometimes wakes,--
     To show with what complacency he creeps,
       With his dear 'Waggoners,' around his lakes.
     He wishes for 'a boat' to sail the deeps--
       Of ocean?--No, of air; and then he makes
     Another outcry for 'a little boat,'
     And drivels seas to set it well afloat.

     If he must fain sweep o'er the ethereal plain,
       And Pegasus runs restive in his 'Waggon,'
     Could he not beg the loan of Charles's Wain?
       Or pray Medea for a single dragon?
     Or if, too classic for his vulgar brain,
       He fear'd his neck to venture such a nag on,
     And he must needs mount nearer to the moon,
     Could not the blockhead ask for a balloon?

     'Pedlars,' and 'Boats,' and 'Waggons!' Oh! ye shades
       Of Pope and Dryden, are we come to this?
     That trash of such sort not alone evades
       Contempt, but from the bathos' vast abyss
     Floats scumlike uppermost, and these Jack Cades
       Of sense and song above your graves may hiss--
     The 'little boatman' and his 'Peter Bell'
     Can sneer at him who drew 'Achitophel'!

     T' our tale.--The feast was over, the slaves gone,
       The dwarfs and dancing girls had all retired;
     The Arab lore and poet's song were done,
       And every sound of revelry expired;
     The lady and her lover, left alone,
       The rosy flood of twilight's sky admired;--
     Ave Maria! o'er the earth and sea,
     That heavenliest hour of Heaven is worthiest thee!

     Ave Maria! blessed be the hour!
       The time, the clime, the spot, where I so oft
     Have felt that moment in its fullest power
       Sink o'er the earth so beautiful and soft,
     While swung the deep bell in the distant tower,
       Or the faint dying day-hymn stole aloft,
     And not a breath crept through the rosy air,
     And yet the forest leaves seem'd stirr'd with prayer.

     Ave Maria! 't is the hour of prayer!
       Ave Maria! 't is the hour of love!
     Ave Maria! may our spirits dare
       Look up to thine and to thy Son's above!
     Ave Maria! oh that face so fair!
       Those downcast eyes beneath the Almighty dove--
     What though 't is but a pictured image?--strike--
     That painting is no idol,--'t is too like.

     Some kinder casuists are pleased to say,
       In nameless print--that I have no devotion;
     But set those persons down with me to pray,
       And you shall see who has the properest notion
     Of getting into heaven the shortest way;
       My altars are the mountains and the ocean,
     Earth, air, stars,--all that springs from the great Whole,
     Who hath produced, and will receive the soul.

     Sweet hour of twilight!--in the solitude
       Of the pine forest, and the silent shore
     Which bounds Ravenna's immemorial wood,
       Rooted where once the Adrian wave flow'd o'er,
     To where the last Caesarean fortress stood,
       Evergreen forest! which Boccaccio's lore
     And Dryden's lay made haunted ground to me,
     How have I loved the twilight hour and thee!

     The shrill cicadas, people of the pine,
       Making their summer lives one ceaseless song,
     Were the sole echoes, save my steed's and mine,
       And vesper bell's that rose the boughs along;
     The spectre huntsman of Onesti's line,
       His hell-dogs, and their chase, and the fair throng
     Which learn'd from this example not to fly
     From a true lover,--shadow'd my mind's eye.

     O, Hesperus! thou bringest all good things--
       Home to the weary, to the hungry cheer,
     To the young bird the parent's brooding wings,
       The welcome stall to the o'erlabour'd steer;
     Whate'er of peace about our hearthstone clings,
       Whate'er our household gods protect of dear,
     Are gather'd round us by thy look of rest;
     Thou bring'st the child, too, to the mother's breast.

     Soft hour! which wakes the wish and melts the heart
       Of those who sail the seas, on the first day
     When they from their sweet friends are torn apart;
       Or fills with love the pilgrim on his way
     As the far bell of vesper makes him start,
       Seeming to weep the dying day's decay;
     Is this a fancy which our reason scorns?
     Ah! surely nothing dies but something mourns!

     When Nero perish'd by the justest doom
       Which ever the destroyer yet destroy'd,
     Amidst the roar of liberated Rome,
       Of nations freed, and the world overjoy'd,
     Some hands unseen strew'd flowers upon his tomb:
       Perhaps the weakness of a heart not void
     Of feeling for some kindness done, when power
     Had left the wretch an uncorrupted hour.

     But I 'm digressing; what on earth has Nero,
       Or any such like sovereign buffoons,
     To do with the transactions of my hero,
       More than such madmen's fellow man--the moon's?
     Sure my invention must be down at zero,
       And I grown one of many 'wooden spoons'
     Of verse (the name with which we Cantabs please
     To dub the last of honours in degrees).

     I feel this tediousness will never do--
       'T is being too epic, and I must cut down
     (In copying) this long canto into two;
       They 'll never find it out, unless I own
     The fact, excepting some experienced few;
       And then as an improvement 't will be shown:
     I 'll prove that such the opinion of the critic is
     From Aristotle passim.--See poietikes.




CANTO THE FOURTH.

     Nothing so difficult as a beginning
       In poesy, unless perhaps the end;
     For oftentimes when Pegasus seems winning
       The race, he sprains a wing, and down we tend,
     Like Lucifer when hurl'd from heaven for sinning;
       Our sin the same, and hard as his to mend,
     Being pride, which leads the mind to soar too far,
     Till our own weakness shows us what we are.

     But Time, which brings all beings to their level,
       And sharp Adversity, will teach at last
     Man,--and, as we would hope,--perhaps the devil,
       That neither of their intellects are vast:
     While youth's hot wishes in our red veins revel,
       We know not this--the blood flows on too fast;
     But as the torrent widens towards the ocean,
     We ponder deeply on each past emotion.

     As boy, I thought myself a clever fellow,
       And wish'd that others held the same opinion;
     They took it up when my days grew more mellow,
       And other minds acknowledged my dominion:
     Now my sere fancy 'falls into the yellow
       Leaf,' and Imagination droops her pinion,
     And the sad truth which hovers o'er my desk
     Turns what was once romantic to burlesque.

     And if I laugh at any mortal thing,
       'T is that I may not weep; and if I weep,
     'T is that our nature cannot always bring
       Itself to apathy, for we must steep
     Our hearts first in the depths of Lethe's spring,
       Ere what we least wish to behold will sleep:
     Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx;
     A mortal mother would on Lethe fix.

     Some have accused me of a strange design
       Against the creed and morals of the land,
     And trace it in this poem every line:
       I don't pretend that I quite understand
     My own meaning when I would be very fine;
       But the fact is that I have nothing plann'd,
     Unless it were to be a moment merry,
     A novel word in my vocabulary.

     To the kind reader of our sober clime
       This way of writing will appear exotic;
     Pulci was sire of the half-serious rhyme,
       Who sang when chivalry was more Quixotic,
     And revell'd in the fancies of the time,
       True knights, chaste dames, huge giants, kings despotic:
     But all these, save the last, being obsolete,
     I chose a modern subject as more meet.

     How I have treated it, I do not know;
       Perhaps no better than they have treated me
     Who have imputed such designs as show
       Not what they saw, but what they wish'd to see:
     But if it gives them pleasure, be it so;
       This is a liberal age, and thoughts are free:
     Meantime Apollo plucks me by the ear,
     And tells me to resume my story here.

     Young Juan and his lady-love were left
       To their own hearts' most sweet society;
     Even Time the pitiless in sorrow cleft
       With his rude scythe such gentle bosoms; he
     Sigh'd to behold them of their hours bereft,
       Though foe to love; and yet they could not be
     Meant to grow old, but die in happy spring,
     Before one charm or hope had taken wing.

     Their faces were not made for wrinkles, their
       Pure blood to stagnate, their great hearts to fail;
     The blank grey was not made to blast their hair,
       But like the climes that know nor snow nor hail
     They were all summer: lightning might assail
       And shiver them to ashes, but to trail
     A long and snake-like life of dull decay
     Was not for them--they had too little day.

     They were alone once more; for them to be
       Thus was another Eden; they were never
     Weary, unless when separate: the tree
       Cut from its forest root of years--the river
     Damm'd from its fountain--the child from the knee
       And breast maternal wean'd at once for ever,--
     Would wither less than these two torn apart;
     Alas! there is no instinct like the heart--

     The heart--which may be broken: happy they!
       Thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,
     The precious porcelain of human clay,
       Break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold
     The long year link'd with heavy day on day,
       And all which must be borne, and never told;
     While life's strange principle will often lie
     Deepest in those who long the most to die.

     'Whom the gods love die young,' was said of yore,
       And many deaths do they escape by this:
     The death of friends, and that which slays even more--
       The death of friendship, love, youth, all that is,
     Except mere breath; and since the silent shore
       Awaits at last even those who longest miss
     The old archer's shafts, perhaps the early grave
     Which men weep over may be meant to save.

     Haidee and Juan thought not of the dead--
       The heavens, and earth, and air, seem'd made for them:
     They found no fault with Time, save that he fled;
       They saw not in themselves aught to condemn:
     Each was the other's mirror, and but read
       Joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem,
     And knew such brightness was but the reflection
     Of their exchanging glances of affection.

     The gentle pressure, and the thrilling touch,
       The least glance better understood than words,
     Which still said all, and ne'er could say too much;
       A language, too, but like to that of birds,
     Known but to them, at least appearing such
       As but to lovers a true sense affords;
     Sweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd
     To those who have ceased to hear such, or ne'er heard,--

     All these were theirs, for they were children still,
       And children still they should have ever been;
     They were not made in the real world to fill
       A busy character in the dull scene,
     But like two beings born from out a rill,
       A nymph and her beloved, all unseen
     To pass their lives in fountains and on flowers,
     And never know the weight of human hours.

     Moons changing had roll'd on, and changeless found
       Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys
     As rarely they beheld throughout their round;
       And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,
     For theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound
       By the mere senses; and that which destroys
     Most love, possession, unto them appear'd
     A thing which each endearment more endear'd.

     O beautiful! and rare as beautiful
       But theirs was love in which the mind delights
     To lose itself when the old world grows dull,
       And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,
     Intrigues, adventures of the common school,
       Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,
     Where Hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,
     Whose husband only knows her not a wh--re.

     Hard words; harsh truth; a truth which many know.
       Enough.--The faithful and the fairy pair,
     Who never found a single hour too slow,
       What was it made them thus exempt from care?
     Young innate feelings all have felt below,
       Which perish in the rest, but in them were
     Inherent--what we mortals call romantic,
     And always envy, though we deem it frantic.

     This is in others a factitious state,
       An opium dream of too much youth and reading,
     But was in them their nature or their fate:
       No novels e'er had set their young hearts bleeding,
     For Haidee's knowledge was by no means great,
       And Juan was a boy of saintly breeding;
     So that there was no reason for their loves
     More than for those of nightingales or doves.

     They gazed upon the sunset; 't is an hour
       Dear unto all, but dearest to their eyes,
     For it had made them what they were: the power
       Of love had first o'erwhelm'd them from such skies,
     When happiness had been their only dower,
       And twilight saw them link'd in passion's ties;
     Charm'd with each other, all things charm'd that brought
     The past still welcome as the present thought.

     I know not why, but in that hour to-night,
       Even as they gazed, a sudden tremor came,
     And swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,
       Like the wind o'er a harp-string, or a flame,
     When one is shook in sound, and one in sight;
       And thus some boding flash'd through either frame,
     And call'd from Juan's breast a faint low sigh,
     While one new tear arose in Haidee's eye.

     That large black prophet eye seem'd to dilate
       And follow far the disappearing sun,
     As if their last day! of a happy date
       With his broad, bright, and dropping orb were gone;
     Juan gazed on her as to ask his fate--
       He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,
     His glance inquired of hers for some excuse
     For feelings causeless, or at least abstruse.

     She turn'd to him, and smiled, but in that sort
       Which makes not others smile; then turn'd aside:
     Whatever feeling shook her, it seem'd short,
       And master'd by her wisdom or her pride;
     When Juan spoke, too--it might be in sport--
       Of this their mutual feeling, she replied--
     'If it should be so,--but--it cannot be--
     Or I at least shall not survive to see.'

     Juan would question further, but she press'd
       His lip to hers, and silenced him with this,
     And then dismiss'd the omen from her breast,
       Defying augury with that fond kiss;
     And no doubt of all methods 't is the best:
       Some people prefer wine--'t is not amiss;
     I have tried both; so those who would a part take
     May choose between the headache and the heartache.

     One of the two, according to your choice,
       Woman or wine, you 'll have to undergo;
     Both maladies are taxes on our joys:
       But which to choose, I really hardly know;
     And if I had to give a casting voice,
       For both sides I could many reasons show,
     And then decide, without great wrong to either,
     It were much better to have both than neither.

     Juan and Haidee gazed upon each other
       With swimming looks of speechless tenderness,
     Which mix'd all feelings, friend, child, lover, brother,
       All that the best can mingle and express
     When two pure hearts are pour'd in one another,
       And love too much, and yet can not love less;
     But almost sanctify the sweet excess
     By the immortal wish and power to bless.

     Mix'd in each other's arms, and heart in heart,
       Why did they not then die?--they had lived too long
     Should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;
       Years could but bring them cruel things or wrong;
     The world was not for them, nor the world's art
       For beings passionate as Sappho's song;
     Love was born with them, in them, so intense,
     It was their very spirit--not a sense.

     They should have lived together deep in woods,
       Unseen as sings the nightingale; they were
     Unfit to mix in these thick solitudes
       Call'd social, haunts of Hate, and Vice, and Care:
     How lonely every freeborn creature broods!
       The sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;
     The eagle soars alone; the gull and crow
     Flock o'er their carrion, just like men below.

     Now pillow'd cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,
       Haidee and Juan their siesta took,
     A gentle slumber, but it was not deep,
       For ever and anon a something shook
     Juan, and shuddering o'er his frame would creep;
       And Haidee's sweet lips murmur'd like a brook
     A wordless music, and her face so fair
     Stirr'd with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air.

     Or as the stirring of a deep dear stream
       Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind
     Walks o'er it, was she shaken by the dream,
       The mystical usurper of the mind--
     O'erpowering us to be whate'er may seem
       Good to the soul which we no more can bind;
     Strange state of being! (for 't is still to be)
     Senseless to feel, and with seal'd eyes to see.

     She dream'd of being alone on the sea-shore,
       Chain'd to a rock; she knew not how, but stir
     She could not from the spot, and the loud roar
       Grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;
     And o'er her upper lip they seem'd to pour,
       Until she sobb'd for breath, and soon they were
     Foaming o'er her lone head, so fierce and high--
     Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die.

     Anon--she was released, and then she stray'd
       O'er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,
     And stumbled almost every step she made;
       And something roll'd before her in a sheet,
     Which she must still pursue howe'er afraid:
       'T was white and indistinct, nor stopp'd to meet
     Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed, and grasp'd,
     And ran, but it escaped her as she clasp'd.

     The dream changed:--in a cave she stood, its walls
       Were hung with marble icicles, the work
     Of ages on its water-fretted halls,
       Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;
     Her hair was dripping, and the very balls
       Of her black eyes seem'd turn'd to tears, and mirk
     The sharp rocks look'd below each drop they caught,
     Which froze to marble as it fell,--she thought.

     And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,
       Pale as the foam that froth'd on his dead brow,
     Which she essay'd in vain to clear (how sweet
       Were once her cares, how idle seem'd they now!),
     Lay Juan, nor could aught renew the beat
       Of his quench'd heart; and the sea dirges low
     Rang in her sad ears like a mermaid's song,
     And that brief dream appear'd a life too long.

     And gazing on the dead, she thought his face
       Faded, or alter'd into something new--
     Like to her father's features, till each trace--
       More like and like to Lambro's aspect grew--
     With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;
       And starting, she awoke, and what to view?
     O! Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she there?
     'T is--'t is her father's--fix'd upon the pair!

     Then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,
       With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see
     Him whom she deem'd a habitant where dwell
       The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be
     Perchance the death of one she loved too well:
       Dear as her father had been to Haidee,
     It was a moment of that awful kind--
     I have seen such--but must not call to mind.

     Up Juan sprung to Haidee's bitter shriek,
       And caught her falling, and from off the wall
     Snatch'd down his sabre, in hot haste to wreak
       Vengeance on him who was the cause of all:
     Then Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,
       Smiled scornfully, and said, 'Within my call,
     A thousand scimitars await the word;
     Put up, young man, put up your silly sword.'

     And Haidee clung around him; 'Juan, 't is--
       'T is Lambro--'t is my father! Kneel with me--
     He will forgive us--yes--it must be--yes.
       O! dearest father, in this agony
     Of pleasure and of pain--even while I kiss
       Thy garment's hem with transport, can it be
     That doubt should mingle with my filial joy?
     Deal with me as thou wilt, but spare this boy.'

     High and inscrutable the old man stood,
       Calm in his voice, and calm within his eye--
     Not always signs with him of calmest mood:
       He look'd upon her, but gave no reply;
     Then turn'd to Juan, in whose cheek the blood
       Oft came and went, as there resolved to die;
     In arms, at least, he stood, in act to spring
     On the first foe whom Lambro's call might bring.

     'Young man, your sword;' so Lambro once more said:
       Juan replied, 'Not while this arm is free.'
     The old man's cheek grew pale, but not with dread,
       And drawing from his belt a pistol, he
     Replied, 'Your blood be then on your own head.'
       Then look'd dose at the flint, as if to see
     'T was fresh--for he had lately used the lock--
     And next proceeded quietly to cock.

     It has a strange quick jar upon the ear,
       That cocking of a pistol, when you know
     A moment more will bring the sight to bear
       Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so;
     A gentlemanly distance, not too near,
       If you have got a former friend for foe;
     But after being fired at once or twice,
     The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice.

     Lambro presented, and one instant more
       Had stopp'd this Canto, and Don Juan's breath,
     When Haidee threw herself her boy before;
       Stern as her sire: 'On me,' she cried, 'let death
     Descend--the fault is mine; this fatal shore
       He found--but sought not. I have pledged my faith;
     I love him--I will die with him: I knew
     Your nature's firmness--know your daughter's too.'

     A minute past, and she had been all tears,
       And tenderness, and infancy; but now
     She stood as one who champion'd human fears--
       Pale, statue-like, and stern, she woo'd the blow;
     And tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,
       She drew up to her height, as if to show
     A fairer mark; and with a fix'd eye scann'd
     Her father's face--but never stopp'd his hand.

     He gazed on her, and she on him; 't was strange
       How like they look'd! the expression was the same;
     Serenely savage, with a little change
       In the large dark eye's mutual-darted flame;
     For she, too, was as one who could avenge,
       If cause should be--a lioness, though tame.
     Her father's blood before her father's face
     Boil'd up, and proved her truly of his race.

     I said they were alike, their features and
       Their stature, differing but in sex and years;
     Even to the delicacy of their hand
       There was resemblance, such as true blood wears;
     And now to see them, thus divided, stand
       In fix'd ferocity, when joyous tears
     And sweet sensations should have welcomed both,
     Show what the passions are in their full growth.

     The father paused a moment, then withdrew
       His weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,
     And looking on her, as to look her through,
       'Not I,' he said, 'have sought this stranger's ill;
     Not I have made this desolation: few
       Would bear such outrage, and forbear to kill;
     But I must do my duty--how thou hast
     Done thine, the present vouches for the past.

     'Let him disarm; or, by my father's head,
       His own shall roll before you like a ball!'
     He raised his whistle, as the word he said,
       And blew; another answer'd to the call,
     And rushing in disorderly, though led,
       And arm'd from boot to turban, one and all,
     Some twenty of his train came, rank on rank;
     He gave the word,--'Arrest or slay the Frank.'

     Then, with a sudden movement, he withdrew
       His daughter; while compress'd within his clasp,
     'Twixt her and Juan interposed the crew;
       In vain she struggled in her father's grasp--
     His arms were like a serpent's coil: then flew
       Upon their prey, as darts an angry asp,
     The file of pirates; save the foremost, who
     Had fallen, with his right shoulder half cut through.

     The second had his cheek laid open; but
       The third, a wary, cool old sworder, took
     The blows upon his cutlass, and then put
       His own well in; so well, ere you could look,
     His man was floor'd, and helpless at his foot,
       With the blood running like a little brook
     From two smart sabre gashes, deep and red--
     One on the arm, the other on the head.

     And then they bound him where he fell, and bore
       Juan from the apartment: with a sign
     Old Lambro bade them take him to the shore,
       Where lay some ships which were to sail at nine.
     They laid him in a boat, and plied the oar
       Until they reach'd some galliots, placed in line;
     On board of one of these, and under hatches,
     They stow'd him, with strict orders to the watches.

     The world is full of strange vicissitudes,
       And here was one exceedingly unpleasant:
     A gentleman so rich in the world's goods,
       Handsome and young, enjoying all the present,
     Just at the very time when he least broods
       On such a thing is suddenly to sea sent,
     Wounded and chain'd, so that he cannot move,
     And all because a lady fell in love.

     Here I must leave him, for I grow pathetic,
       Moved by the Chinese nymph of tears, green tea!
     Than whom Cassandra was not more prophetic;
       For if my pure libations exceed three,
     I feel my heart become so sympathetic,
       That I must have recourse to black Bohea:
     'T is pity wine should be so deleterious,
     For tea and coffee leave us much more serious,

     Unless when qualified with thee, Cogniac!
       Sweet Naiad of the Phlegethontic rill!
     Ah! why the liver wilt thou thus attack,
       And make, like other nymphs, thy lovers ill?
     I would take refuge in weak punch, but rack
       (In each sense of the word), whene'er I fill
     My mild and midnight beakers to the brim,
     Wakes me next morning with its synonym.

     I leave Don Juan for the present, safe--
       Not sound, poor fellow, but severely wounded;
     Yet could his corporal pangs amount to half
       Of those with which his Haidee's bosom bounded?
     She was not one to weep, and rave, and chafe,
       And then give way, subdued because surrounded;
     Her mother was a Moorish maid, from Fez,
     Where all is Eden, or a wilderness.

     There the large olive rains its amber store
       In marble fonts; there grain, and flower, and fruit,
     Gush from the earth until the land runs o'er;
       But there, too, many a poison-tree has root,
     And midnight listens to the lion's roar,
       And long, long deserts scorch the camel's foot,
     Or heaving whelm the helpless caravan;
     And as the soil is, so the heart of man.

     Afric is all the sun's, and as her earth
       Her human day is kindled; full of power
     For good or evil, burning from its birth,
       The Moorish blood partakes the planet's hour,
     And like the soil beneath it will bring forth:
       Beauty and love were Haidee's mother's dower;
     But her large dark eye show'd deep Passion's force,
     Though sleeping like a lion near a source.

     Her daughter, temper'd with a milder ray,
       Like summer clouds all silvery, smooth, and fair,
     Till slowly charged with thunder they display
       Terror to earth, and tempest to the air,
     Had held till now her soft and milky way;
       But overwrought with passion and despair,
     The fire burst forth from her Numidian veins,
     Even as the Simoom sweeps the blasted plains.

     The last sight which she saw was Juan's gore,
       And he himself o'ermaster'd and cut down;
     His blood was running on the very floor
       Where late he trod, her beautiful, her own;
     Thus much she view'd an instant and no more,--
       Her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan;
     On her sire's arm, which until now scarce held
     Her writhing, fell she like a cedar fell'd.

     A vein had burst, and her sweet lips' pure dyes
       Were dabbled with the deep blood which ran o'er;
     And her head droop'd as when the lily lies
       O'ercharged with rain: her summon'd handmaids bore
     Their lady to her couch with gushing eyes;
       Of herbs and cordials they produced their store,
     But she defied all means they could employ,
     Like one life could not hold, nor death destroy.

     Days lay she in that state unchanged, though chill--
       With nothing livid, still her lips were red;
     She had no pulse, but death seem'd absent still;
       No hideous sign proclaim'd her surely dead;
     Corruption came not in each mind to kill
       All hope; to look upon her sweet face bred
     New thoughts of life, for it seem'd full of soul--
     She had so much, earth could not claim the whole.

     The ruling passion, such as marble shows
       When exquisitely chisell'd, still lay there,
     But fix'd as marble's unchanged aspect throws
       O'er the fair Venus, but for ever fair;
     O'er the Laocoon's all eternal throes,
       And ever-dying Gladiator's air,
     Their energy like life forms all their fame,
     Yet looks not life, for they are still the same.

     She woke at length, but not as sleepers wake,
       Rather the dead, for life seem'd something new,
     A strange sensation which she must partake
       Perforce, since whatsoever met her view
     Struck not on memory, though a heavy ache
       Lay at her heart, whose earliest beat still true
     Brought back the sense of pain without the cause,
     For, for a while, the furies made a pause.

     She look'd on many a face with vacant eye,
       On many a token without knowing what;
     She saw them watch her without asking why,
       And reck'd not who around her pillow sat;
     Not speechless, though she spoke not; not a sigh
       Relieved her thoughts; dull silence and quick chat
     Were tried in vain by those who served; she gave
     No sign, save breath, of having left the grave.

     Her handmaids tended, but she heeded not;
       Her father watch'd, she turn'd her eyes away;
     She recognized no being, and no spot,
       However dear or cherish'd in their day;
     They changed from room to room--but all forgot--
       Gentle, but without memory she lay;
     At length those eyes, which they would fain be weaning
     Back to old thoughts, wax'd full of fearful meaning.

     And then a slave bethought her of a harp;
       The harper came, and tuned his instrument;
     At the first notes, irregular and sharp,
       On him her flashing eyes a moment bent,
     Then to the wall she turn'd as if to warp
       Her thoughts from sorrow through her heart re-sent;
     And he begun a long low island song
     Of ancient days, ere tyranny grew strong.

     Anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall
       In time to his old tune; he changed the theme,
     And sung of love; the fierce name struck through all
       Her recollection; on her flash'd the dream
     Of what she was, and is, if ye could call
       To be so being; in a gushing stream
     The tears rush'd forth from her o'erclouded brain,
     Like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain.

     Short solace, vain relief!--thought came too quick,
       And whirl'd her brain to madness; she arose
     As one who ne'er had dwelt among the sick,
       And flew at all she met, as on her foes;
     But no one ever heard her speak or shriek,
       Although her paroxysm drew towards its dose;--
     Hers was a phrensy which disdain'd to rave,
     Even when they smote her, in the hope to save.

     Yet she betray'd at times a gleam of sense;
       Nothing could make her meet her father's face,
     Though on all other things with looks intense
       She gazed, but none she ever could retrace;
     Food she refused, and raiment; no pretence
       Avail'd for either; neither change of place,
     Nor time, nor skill, nor remedy, could give her
     Senses to sleep--the power seem'd gone for ever.

     Twelve days and nights she wither'd thus; at last,
       Without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show
     A parting pang, the spirit from her past:
       And they who watch'd her nearest could not know
     The very instant, till the change that cast
       Her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,
     Glazed o'er her eyes--the beautiful, the black--
     O! to possess such lustre--and then lack!

     She died, but not alone; she held within
       A second principle of life, which might
     Have dawn'd a fair and sinless child of sin;
       But closed its little being without light,
     And went down to the grave unborn, wherein
       Blossom and bough lie wither'd with one blight;
     In vain the dews of Heaven descend above
     The bleeding flower and blasted fruit of love.

     Thus lived--thus died she; never more on her
       Shall sorrow light, or shame. She was not made
     Through years or moons the inner weight to bear,
       Which colder hearts endure till they are laid
     By age in earth: her days and pleasures were
       Brief, but delightful--such as had not staid
     Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well
     By the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell.

     That isle is now all desolate and bare,
       Its dwellings down, its tenants pass'd away;
     None but her own and father's grave is there,
       And nothing outward tells of human clay;
     Ye could not know where lies a thing so fair,
       No stone is there to show, no tongue to say
     What was; no dirge, except the hollow sea's,
     Mourns o'er the beauty of the Cyclades.

     But many a Greek maid in a loving song
       Sighs o'er her name; and many an islander
     With her sire's story makes the night less long;
       Valour was his, and beauty dwelt with her:
     If she loved rashly, her life paid for wrong--
       A heavy price must all pay who thus err,
     In some shape; let none think to fly the danger,
     For soon or late Love is his own avenger.

     But let me change this theme which grows too sad,
       And lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf;
     I don't much like describing people mad,
       For fear of seeming rather touch'd myself--
     Besides, I 've no more on this head to add;
       And as my Muse is a capricious elf,
     We 'll put about, and try another tack
     With Juan, left half-kill'd some stanzas back.

     Wounded and fetter'd, 'cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,'
       Some days and nights elapsed before that he
     Could altogether call the past to mind;
       And when he did, he found himself at sea,
     Sailing six knots an hour before the wind;
       The shores of Ilion lay beneath their lee--
     Another time he might have liked to see 'em,
     But now was not much pleased with Cape Sigaeum.

     There, on the green and village-cotted hill, is
       (Flank'd by the Hellespont and by the sea)
     Entomb'd the bravest of the brave, Achilles;
       They say so (Bryant says the contrary):
     And further downward, tall and towering still, is
       The tumulus--of whom? Heaven knows! 't may be
     Patroclus, Ajax, or Protesilaus--
     All heroes, who if living still would slay us.

     High barrows, without marble or a name,
       A vast, untill'd, and mountain-skirted plain,
     And Ida in the distance, still the same,
       And old Scamander (if 't is he) remain;
     The situation seems still form'd for fame--
       A hundred thousand men might fight again
     With case; but where I sought for Ilion's walls,
     The quiet sheep feeds, and the tortoise crawls;

     Troops of untended horses; here and there
       Some little hamlets, with new names uncouth;
     Some shepherds (unlike Paris) led to stare
       A moment at the European youth
     Whom to the spot their school-boy feelings bear;
       A turk, with beads in hand and pipe in mouth,
     Extremely taken with his own religion,
     Are what I found there--but the devil a Phrygian.

     Don Juan, here permitted to emerge
       From his dull cabin, found himself a slave;
     Forlorn, and gazing on the deep blue surge,
       O'ershadow'd there by many a hero's grave;
     Weak still with loss of blood, he scarce could urge
       A few brief questions; and the answers gave
     No very satisfactory information
     About his past or present situation.

     He saw some fellow captives, who appear'd
       To be Italians, as they were in fact;
     From them, at least, their destiny he heard,
       Which was an odd one; a troop going to act
     In Sicily (all singers, duly rear'd
       In their vocation) had not been attack'd
     In sailing from Livorno by the pirate,
     But sold by the impresario at no high rate.

     By one of these, the buffo of the party,
       Juan was told about their curious case;
     For although destined to the Turkish mart, he
       Still kept his spirits up--at least his face;
     The little fellow really look'd quite hearty,
       And bore him with some gaiety and grace,
     Showing a much more reconciled demeanour,
     Than did the prima donna and the tenor.

     In a few words he told their hapless story,
       Saying, 'Our Machiavellian impresario,
     Making a signal off some promontory,
       Hail'd a strange brig--Corpo di Caio Mario!
     We were transferr'd on board her in a hurry,
       Without a Single scudo of salario;
     But if the Sultan has a taste for song,
     We will revive our fortunes before long.

     'The prima donna, though a little old,
       And haggard with a dissipated life,
     And subject, when the house is thin, to cold,
       Has some good notes; and then the tenor's wife,
     With no great voice, is pleasing to behold;
       Last carnival she made a deal of strife
     By carrying off Count Cesare Cicogna
     From an old Roman princess at Bologna.

     'And then there are the dancers; there 's the Nini,
       With more than one profession, gains by all;
     Then there 's that laughing slut the Pelegrini,
       She, too, was fortunate last carnival,
     And made at least five hundred good zecchini,
       But spends so fast, she has not now a paul;
     And then there 's the Grotesca--such a dancer!
     Where men have souls or bodies she must answer.

     'As for the figuranti, they are like
       The rest of all that tribe; with here and there
     A pretty person, which perhaps may strike,
       The rest are hardly fitted for a fair;
     There 's one, though tall and stiffer than a pike,
       Yet has a sentimental kind of air
     Which might go far, but she don't dance with vigour;
     The more 's the pity, with her face and figure.

     'As for the men, they are a middling set;
       The musico is but a crack'd old basin,
     But being qualified in one way yet,
       May the seraglio do to set his face in,
     And as a servant some preferment get;
       His singing I no further trust can place in:
     From all the Pope makes yearly 't would perplex
     To find three perfect pipes of the third sex.

     'The tenor's voice is spoilt by affectation,
       And for the bass, the beast can only bellow;
     In fact, he had no singing education,
       An ignorant, noteless, timeless, tuneless fellow;
     But being the prima donna's near relation,
       Who swore his voice was very rich and mellow,
     They hired him, though to hear him you 'd believe
     An ass was practising recitative.

     ''T would not become myself to dwell upon
       My own merits, and though young--I see, Sir--you
     Have got a travell'd air, which speaks you one
       To whom the opera is by no means new:
     You 've heard of Raucocanti?--I 'm the man;
       The time may come when you may hear me too;
     You was not last year at the fair of Lugo,
     But next, when I 'm engaged to sing there--do go.

     'Our baritone I almost had forgot,
       A pretty lad, but bursting with conceit;
     With graceful action, science not a jot,
       A voice of no great compass, and not sweet,
     He always is complaining of his lot,
       Forsooth, scarce fit for ballads in the street;
     In lovers' parts his passion more to breathe,
     Having no heart to show, he shows his teeth.'

     Here Raucocanti's eloquent recital
       Was interrupted by the pirate crew,
     Who came at stated moments to invite all
       The captives back to their sad berths; each threw
     A rueful glance upon the waves (which bright all
       From the blue skies derived a double blue,
     Dancing all free and happy in the sun),
     And then went down the hatchway one by one.

     They heard next day--that in the Dardanelles,
       Waiting for his Sublimity's firman,
     The most imperative of sovereign spells,
       Which every body does without who can,
     More to secure them in their naval cells,
       Lady to lady, well as man to man,
     Were to be chain'd and lotted out per couple,
     For the slave market of Constantinople.

     It seems when this allotment was made out,
       There chanced to be an odd male, and odd female,
     Who (after some discussion and some doubt,
       If the soprano might be deem'd to be male,
     They placed him o'er the women as a scout)
       Were link'd together, and it happen'd the male
     Was Juan,--who, an awkward thing at his age,
     Pair'd off with a Bacchante blooming visage.

     With Raucocanti lucklessly was chain'd
       The tenor; these two hated with a hate
     Found only on the stage, and each more pain'd
       With this his tuneful neighbour than his fate;
     Sad strife arose, for they were so cross-grain'd,
       Instead of bearing up without debate,
     That each pull'd different ways with many an oath,
     'Arcades ambo,' id est--blackguards both.

     Juan's companion was a Romagnole,
       But bred within the March of old Ancona,
     With eyes that look'd into the very soul
       (And other chief points of a 'bella donna'),
     Bright--and as black and burning as a coal;
       And through her dear brunette complexion shone
     Great wish to please--a most attractive dower,
     Especially when added to the power.

     But all that power was wasted upon him,
       For sorrow o'er each sense held stern command;
     Her eye might flash on his, but found it dim;
       And though thus chain'd, as natural her hand
     Touch'd his, nor that--nor any handsome limb
       (And she had some not easy to withstand)
     Could stir his pulse, or make his faith feel brittle;
     Perhaps his recent wounds might help a little.

     No matter; we should ne'er too much enquire,
       But facts are facts: no knight could be more true,
     And firmer faith no ladye--love desire;
       We will omit the proofs, save one or two:
     'T is said no one in hand 'can hold a fire
       By thought of frosty Caucasus;' but few,
     I really think; yet Juan's then ordeal
     Was more triumphant, and not much less real.

     Here I might enter on a chaste description,
       Having withstood temptation in my youth,
     But hear that several people take exception
       At the first two books having too much truth;
     Therefore I 'll make Don Juan leave the ship soon,
       Because the publisher declares, in sooth,
     Through needles' eyes it easier for the camel is
     To pass, than those two cantos into families.

     'T is all the same to me; I 'm fond of yielding,
       And therefore leave them to the purer page
     Of Smollett, Prior, Ariosto, Fielding,
       Who say strange things for so correct an age;
     I once had great alacrity in wielding
       My pen, and liked poetic war to wage,
     And recollect the time when all this cant
     Would have provoked remarks which now it shan't.

     As boys love rows, my boyhood liked a squabble;
       But at this hour I wish to part in peace,
     Leaving such to the literary rabble:
       Whether my verse's fame be doom'd to cease
     While the right hand which wrote it still is able,
       Or of some centuries to take a lease,
     The grass upon my grave will grow as long,
     And sigh to midnight winds, but not to song.

     Of poets who come down to us through distance
       Of time and tongues, the foster-babes of Fame,
     Life seems the smallest portion of existence;
       Where twenty ages gather o'er a name,
     'T is as a snowball which derives assistance
       From every flake, and yet rolls on the same,
     Even till an iceberg it may chance to grow;
     But, after all, 't is nothing but cold snow.

     And so great names are nothing more than nominal,
       And love of glory 's but an airy lust,
     Too often in its fury overcoming all
       Who would as 't were identify their dust
     From out the wide destruction, which, entombing all,
       Leaves nothing till 'the coming of the just'-
     Save change: I 've stood upon Achilles' tomb,
     And heard Troy doubted; time will doubt of Rome.

     The very generations of the dead
       Are swept away, and tomb inherits tomb,
     Until the memory of an age is fled,
       And, buried, sinks beneath its offspring's doom:
     Where are the epitaphs our fathers read?
       Save a few glean'd from the sepulchral gloom
     Which once-named myriads nameless lie beneath,
     And lose their own in universal death.

     I canter by the spot each afternoon
       Where perish'd in his fame the hero-boy,
     Who lived too long for men, but died too soon
       For human vanity, the young De Foix!
     A broken pillar, not uncouthly hewn,
       But which neglect is hastening to destroy,
     Records Ravenna's carnage on its face,
     While weeds and ordure rankle round the base.

     I pass each day where Dante's bones are laid:
       A little cupola, more neat than solemn,
     Protects his dust, but reverence here is paid
       To the bard's tomb, and not the warrior's column.
     The time must come, when both alike decay'd,
       The chieftain's trophy, and the poet's volume,
     Will sink where lie the songs and wars of earth,
     Before Pelides' death, or Homer's birth.

     With human blood that column was cemented,
       With human filth that column is defiled,
     As if the peasant's coarse contempt were vented
       To show his loathing of the spot he soil'd:
     Thus is the trophy used, and thus lamented
       Should ever be those blood-hounds, from whose wild
     Instinct of gore and glory earth has known
     Those sufferings Dante saw in hell alone.

     Yet there will still be bards: though fame is smoke,
       Its fumes are frankincense to human thought;
     And the unquiet feelings, which first woke
       Song in the world, will seek what then they sought;
     As on the beach the waves at last are broke,
       Thus to their extreme verge the passions brought
     Dash into poetry, which is but passion,
     Or at least was so ere it grew a fashion.

     If in the course of such a life as was
       At once adventurous and contemplative,
     Men, who partake all passions as they pass,
       Acquire the deep and bitter power to give
     Their images again as in a glass,
       And in such colours that they seem to live;
     You may do right forbidding them to show 'em,
     But spoil (I think) a very pretty poem.

     O! ye, who make the fortunes of all books!
       Benign Ceruleans of the second sex!
     Who advertise new poems by your looks,
       Your 'imprimatur' will ye not annex?
     What! must I go to the oblivious cooks,
       Those Cornish plunderers of Parnassian wrecks?
     Ah! must I then the only minstrel be,
     Proscribed from tasting your Castalian tea!

     What! can I prove 'a lion' then no more?
       A ball-room bard, a foolscap, hot-press darling?
     To bear the compliments of many a bore,
       And sigh, 'I can't get out,' like Yorick's starling;
     Why then I 'll swear, as poet Wordy swore
       (Because the world won't read him, always snarling),
     That taste is gone, that fame is but a lottery,
     Drawn by the blue-coat misses of a coterie.

     O! 'darkly, deeply, beautifully blue,'
       As some one somewhere sings about the sky,
     And I, ye learned ladies, say of you;
       They say your stockings are so (Heaven knows why,
     I have examined few pair of that hue);
       Blue as the garters which serenely lie
     Round the Patrician left-legs, which adorn
     The festal midnight, and the levee morn.

     Yet some of you are most seraphic creatures--
       But times are alter'd since, a rhyming lover,
     You read my stanzas, and I read your features:
       And--but no matter, all those things are over;
     Still I have no dislike to learned natures,
       For sometimes such a world of virtues cover;
     I knew one woman of that purple school,
     The loveliest, chastest, best, but--quite a fool.

     Humboldt, 'the first of travellers,' but not
       The last, if late accounts be accurate,
     Invented, by some name I have forgot,
       As well as the sublime discovery's date,
     An airy instrument, with which he sought
       To ascertain the atmospheric state,
     By measuring 'the intensity of blue:'
     O, Lady Daphne! let me measure you!

     But to the narrative:--The vessel bound
       With slaves to sell off in the capital,
     After the usual process, might be found
       At anchor under the seraglio wall;
     Her cargo, from the plague being safe and sound,
       Were landed in the market, one and all,
     And there with Georgians, Russians, and Circassians,
     Bought up for different purposes and passions.

     Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
       For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,
     Warranted virgin; beauty's brightest colours
       Had deck'd her out in all the hues of heaven:
     Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
       Who bade on till the hundreds reach'd eleven;
     But when the offer went beyond, they knew
     'T was for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.

     Twelve negresses from Nubia brought a price
       Which the West Indian market scarce would bring;
     Though Wilberforce, at last, has made it twice
       What 't was ere Abolition; and the thing
     Need not seem very wonderful, for vice
       Is always much more splendid than a king:
     The virtues, even the most exalted, Charity,
     Are saving--vice spares nothing for a rarity.

     But for the destiny of this young troop,
       How some were bought by pachas, some by Jews,
     How some to burdens were obliged to stoop,
       And others rose to the command of crews
     As renegadoes; while in hapless group,
       Hoping no very old vizier might choose,
     The females stood, as one by one they pick'd 'em,
     To make a mistress, or fourth wife, or victim:

     All this must be reserved for further song;
       Also our hero's lot, howe'er unpleasant
     (Because this Canto has become too long),
       Must be postponed discreetly for the present;
     I 'm sensible redundancy is wrong,
       But could not for the muse of me put less in 't:
     And now delay the progress of Don Juan,
     Till what is call'd in Ossian the fifth Juan.


[Illustration: Canto 5]




CANTO THE FIFTH.

     When amatory poets sing their loves
       In liquid lines mellifluously bland,
     And pair their rhymes as Venus yokes her doves,
       They little think what mischief is in hand;
     The greater their success the worse it proves,
       As Ovid's verse may give to understand;
     Even Petrarch's self, if judged with due severity,
     Is the Platonic pimp of all posterity.

     I therefore do denounce all amorous writing,
       Except in such a way as not to attract;
     Plain--simple--short, and by no means inviting,
       But with a moral to each error tack'd,
     Form'd rather for instructing than delighting,
       And with all passions in their turn attack'd;
     Now, if my Pegasus should not be shod ill,
     This poem will become a moral model.

     The European with the Asian shore
       Sprinkled with palaces; the ocean stream
     Here and there studded with a seventy-four;
       Sophia's cupola with golden gleam;
     The cypress groves; Olympus high and hoar;
       The twelve isles, and the more than I could dream,
     Far less describe, present the very view
     Which charm'd the charming Mary Montagu.

     I have a passion for the name of 'Mary,'
       For once it was a magic sound to me;
     And still it half calls up the realms of fairy,
       Where I beheld what never was to be;
     All feelings changed, but this was last to vary,
       A spell from which even yet I am not quite free:
     But I grow sad--and let a tale grow cold,
     Which must not be pathetically told.

     The wind swept down the Euxine, and the wave
       Broke foaming o'er the blue Symplegades;
     'T is a grand sight from off 'the Giant's Grave
       To watch the progress of those rolling seas
     Between the Bosphorus, as they lash and lave
       Europe and Asia, you being quite at ease;
     There 's not a sea the passenger e'er pukes in,
     Turns up more dangerous breakers than the Euxine.

     'T was a raw day of Autumn's bleak beginning,
       When nights are equal, but not so the days;
     The Parcae then cut short the further spinning
       Of seamen's fates, and the loud tempests raise
     The waters, and repentance for past sinning
       In all, who o'er the great deep take their ways:
     They vow to amend their lives, and yet they don't;
     Because if drown'd, they can't--if spared, they won't.

     A crowd of shivering slaves of every nation,
       And age, and sex, were in the market ranged;
     Each bevy with the merchant in his station:
       Poor creatures! their good looks were sadly changed.
     All save the blacks seem'd jaded with vexation,
       From friends, and home, and freedom far estranged;
     The negroes more philosophy display'd,--
     Used to it, no doubt, as eels are to be flay'd.

     Juan was juvenile, and thus was full,
       As most at his age are, of hope and health;
     Yet I must own he looked a little dull,
       And now and then a tear stole down by stealth;
     Perhaps his recent loss of blood might pull
       His spirit down; and then the loss of wealth,
     A mistress, and such comfortable quarters,
     To be put up for auction amongst Tartars,

     Were things to shake a stoic; ne'ertheless,
       Upon the whole his carriage was serene:
     His figure, and the splendour of his dress,
       Of which some gilded remnants still were seen,
     Drew all eyes on him, giving them to guess
       He was above the vulgar by his mien;
     And then, though pale, he was so very handsome;
     And then--they calculated on his ransom.

     Like a backgammon board the place was dotted
       With whites and blacks, in groups on show for sale,
     Though rather more irregularly spotted:
       Some bought the jet, while others chose the pale.
     It chanced amongst the other people lotted,
       A man of thirty rather stout and hale,
     With resolution in his dark grey eye,
     Next Juan stood, till some might choose to buy.

     He had an English look; that is, was square
       In make, of a complexion white and ruddy,
     Good teeth, with curling rather dark brown hair,
       And, it might be from thought or toil or study,
     An open brow a little mark'd with care:
       One arm had on a bandage rather bloody;
     And there he stood with such sang-froid, that greater
     Could scarce be shown even by a mere spectator.

     But seeing at his elbow a mere lad,
       Of a high spirit evidently, though
     At present weigh'd down by a doom which had
       O'erthrown even men, he soon began to show
     A kind of blunt compassion for the sad
       Lot of so young a partner in the woe,
     Which for himself he seem'd to deem no worse
     Than any other scrape, a thing of course.

     'My boy!' said he, 'amidst this motley crew
       Of Georgians, Russians, Nubians, and what not,
     All ragamuffins differing but in hue,
       With whom it is our luck to cast our lot,
     The only gentlemen seem I and you;
       So let us be acquainted, as we ought:
     If I could yield you any consolation,
     'T would give me pleasure.--Pray, what is your nation?'

     When Juan answer'd--'Spanish!' he replied,
       'I thought, in fact, you could not be a Greek;
     Those servile dogs are not so proudly eyed:
       Fortune has play'd you here a pretty freak,
     But that 's her way with all men, till they 're tried;
       But never mind,--she 'll turn, perhaps, next week;
     She has served me also much the same as you,
     Except that I have found it nothing new.'

     'Pray, sir,' said Juan, 'if I may presume,
       What brought you here?'--'Oh! nothing very rare--
     Six Tartars and a drag-chain.'--'To this doom
       But what conducted, if the question's fair,
     Is that which I would learn.'--'I served for some
       Months with the Russian army here and there,
     And taking lately, by Suwarrow's bidding,
     A town, was ta'en myself instead of Widdin.'

     'Have you no friends?'--'I had--but, by God's blessing,
       Have not been troubled with them lately. Now
     I have answer'd all your questions without pressing,
       And you an equal courtesy should show.'
     'Alas!' said Juan, ''t were a tale distressing,
       And long besides.'--'Oh! if 't is really so,
     You 're right on both accounts to hold your tongue;
     A sad tale saddens doubly, when 't is long.

     'But droop not: Fortune at your time of life,
       Although a female moderately fickle,
     Will hardly leave you (as she 's not your wife)
       For any length of days in such a pickle.
     To strive, too, with our fate were such a strife
       As if the corn-sheaf should oppose the sickle:
     Men are the sport of circumstances, when
     The circumstances seem the sport of men.'

     ''T is not,' said Juan, 'for my present doom
       I mourn, but for the past;--I loved a maid:'-
     He paused, and his dark eye grew full of gloom;
       A single tear upon his eyelash staid
     A moment, and then dropp'd; 'but to resume,
       'T is not my present lot, as I have said,
     Which I deplore so much; for I have borne
     Hardships which have the hardiest overworn,

     'On the rough deep. But this last blow-' and here
       He stopp'd again, and turn'd away his face.
     'Ay,' quoth his friend, 'I thought it would appear
       That there had been a lady in the case;
     And these are things which ask a tender tear,
       Such as I, too, would shed if in your place:
     I cried upon my first wife's dying day,
     And also when my second ran away:

     'My third-'--'Your third!' quoth Juan, turning round;
       'You scarcely can be thirty: have you three?'
     'No--only two at present above ground:
       Surely 't is nothing wonderful to see
     One person thrice in holy wedlock bound!'
       'Well, then, your third,' said Juan; 'what did she?
     She did not run away, too,--did she, sir?'
     'No, faith.'--'What then?'--'I ran away from her.'

     'You take things coolly, sir,' said Juan. 'Why,'
       Replied the other, 'what can a man do?
     There still are many rainbows in your sky,
       But mine have vanish'd. All, when life is new,
     Commence with feelings warm, and prospects high;
       But time strips our illusions of their hue,
     And one by one in turn, some grand mistake
     Casts off its bright skin yearly like the snake.

     ''T is true, it gets another bright and fresh,
       Or fresher, brighter; but the year gone through,
     This skin must go the way, too, of all flesh,
       Or sometimes only wear a week or two;--
     Love 's the first net which spreads its deadly mesh;
       Ambition, Avarice, Vengeance, Glory, glue
     The glittering lime-twigs of our latter days,
     Where still we flutter on for pence or praise.'

     'All this is very fine, and may be true,'
       Said Juan; 'but I really don't see how
     It betters present times with me or you.'
       'No?' quoth the other; 'yet you will allow
     By setting things in their right point of view,
       Knowledge, at least, is gain'd; for instance, now,
     We know what slavery is, and our disasters
     May teach us better to behave when masters.'

     'Would we were masters now, if but to try
       Their present lessons on our Pagan friends here,'
     Said Juan,--swallowing a heart-burning sigh:
       'Heaven help the scholar whom his fortune sends here!'
     'Perhaps we shall be one day, by and by,'
       Rejoin'd the other, when our bad luck mends here;
     Meantime (yon old black eunuch seems to eye us)

     'But after all, what is our present state?
       'T is bad, and may be better--all men's lot:
     Most men are slaves, none more so than the great,
       To their own whims and passions, and what not;
     Society itself, which should create
       Kindness, destroys what little we had got:
     To feel for none is the true social art
     Of the world's stoics--men without a heart.'

     Just now a black old neutral personage
       Of the third sex stept up, and peering over
     The captives, seem'd to mark their looks and age,
       And capabilities, as to discover
     If they were fitted for the purposed cage:
       No lady e'er is ogled by a lover,
     Horse by a blackleg, broadcloth by a tailor,
     Fee by a counsel, felon by a jailor,

     As is a slave by his intended bidder.
       'T is pleasant purchasing our fellow-creatures;
     And all are to be sold, if you consider
       Their passions, and are dext'rous; some by features
     Are bought up, others by a warlike leader,
       Some by a place--as tend their years or natures;
     The most by ready cash--but all have prices,
     From crowns to kicks, according to their vices.

     The eunuch, having eyed them o'er with care,
       Turn'd to the merchant, and begun to bid
     First but for one, and after for the pair;
       They haggled, wrangled, swore, too--so they did!
     As though they were in a mere Christian fair
       Cheapening an ox, an ass, a lamb, or kid;
     So that their bargain sounded like a battle
     For this superior yoke of human cattle.

     At last they settled into simple grumbling,
       And pulling out reluctant purses, and
     Turning each piece of silver o'er, and tumbling
       Some down, and weighing others in their hand,
     And by mistake sequins with paras jumbling,
       Until the sum was accurately scann'd,
     And then the merchant giving change, and signing
     Receipts in full, began to think of dining.

     I wonder if his appetite was good?
       Or, if it were, if also his digestion?
     Methinks at meals some odd thoughts might intrude,
       And conscience ask a curious sort of question,
     About the right divine how far we should
       Sell flesh and blood. When dinner has opprest one,
     I think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour
     Which turns up out of the sad twenty-four.

     Voltaire says 'No:' he tells you that Candide
       Found life most tolerable after meals;
     He 's wrong--unless man were a pig, indeed,
       Repletion rather adds to what he feels,
     Unless he 's drunk, and then no doubt he 's freed
       From his own brain's oppression while it reels.
     Of food I think with Philip's son, or rather
     Ammon's (ill pleased with one world and one father);

     I think with Alexander, that the act
       Of eating, with another act or two,
     Makes us feel our mortality in fact
       Redoubled; when a roast and a ragout,
     And fish, and soup, by some side dishes back'd,
       Can give us either pain or pleasure, who
     Would pique himself on intellects, whose use
     Depends so much upon the gastric juice?

     The other evening ('t was on Friday last)--
       This is a fact and no poetic fable--
     Just as my great coat was about me cast,
       My hat and gloves still lying on the table,
     I heard a shot--'t was eight o'clock scarce past--
       And, running out as fast as I was able,
     I found the military commandant
     Stretch'd in the street, and able scarce to pant.

     Poor fellow! for some reason, surely bad,
       They had slain him with five slugs; and left him there
     To perish on the pavement: so I had
       Him borne into the house and up the stair,
     And stripp'd and look'd to--But why should I ad
       More circumstances? vain was every care;
     The man was gone: in some Italian quarrel
     Kill'd by five bullets from an old gun-barrel.

     I gazed upon him, for I knew him well;
       And though I have seen many corpses, never
     Saw one, whom such an accident befell,
       So calm; though pierced through stomach, heart, and liver,
     He seem'd to sleep,--for you could scarcely tell
       (As he bled inwardly, no hideous river
     Of gore divulged the cause) that he was dead:
     So as I gazed on him, I thought or said--

     'Can this be death? then what is life or death?
       Speak!' but he spoke not: 'Wake!' but still he slept:--
     'But yesterday and who had mightier breath?
       A thousand warriors by his word were kept
     In awe: he said, as the centurion saith,
       "Go," and he goeth; "come," and forth he stepp'd.
     The trump and bugle till he spake were dumb--
     And now nought left him but the muffled drum.'

     And they who waited once and worshipp'd--they
       With their rough faces throng'd about the bed
     To gaze once more on the commanding clay
       Which for the last, though not the first, time bled:
     And such an end! that he who many a day
       Had faced Napoleon's foes until they fled,--
     The foremost in the charge or in the sally,
     Should now be butcher'd in a civic alley.

     The scars of his old wounds were near his new,
       Those honourable scars which brought him fame;
     And horrid was the contrast to the view--
       But let me quit the theme; as such things claim
     Perhaps even more attention than is due
       From me: I gazed (as oft I have gazed the same)
     To try if I could wrench aught out of death
     Which should confirm, or shake, or make a faith;

     But it was all a mystery. Here we are,
       And there we go:--but where? five bits of lead,
     Or three, or two, or one, send very far!
       And is this blood, then, form'd but to be shed?
     Can every element our elements mar?
       And air--earth--water--fire live--and we dead?
     We whose minds comprehend all things? No more;
     But let us to the story as before.

     The purchaser of Juan and acquaintance
       Bore off his bargains to a gilded boat,
     Embark'd himself and them, and off they went thence
       As fast as oars could pull and water float;
     They look'd like persons being led to sentence,
       Wondering what next, till the caique was brought
     Up in a little creek below a wall
     O'ertopp'd with cypresses, dark-green and tall.

     Here their conductor tapping at the wicket
       Of a small iron door, 't was open'd, and
     He led them onward, first through a low thicket
       Flank'd by large groves, which tower'd on either hand:
     They almost lost their way, and had to pick it--
       For night was dosing ere they came to land.
     The eunuch made a sign to those on board,
     Who row'd off, leaving them without a word.

     As they were plodding on their winding way
       Through orange bowers, and jasmine, and so forth
     (Of which I might have a good deal to say,
       There being no such profusion in the North
     Of oriental plants, 'et cetera,'
       But that of late your scribblers think it worth
     Their while to rear whole hotbeds in their works
     Because one poet travell'd 'mongst the Turks)--

     As they were threading on their way, there came
       Into Don Juan's head a thought, which he
     Whisper'd to his companion:--'t was the same
       Which might have then occurr'd to you or me.
     'Methinks,' said he, 'it would be no great shame
       If we should strike a stroke to set us free;
     Let 's knock that old black fellow on the head,
     And march away--'t were easier done than said.'

     'Yes,' said the other, 'and when done, what then?
       How get out? how the devil got we in?
     And when we once were fairly out, and when
       From Saint Bartholomew we have saved our skin,
     To-morrow 'd see us in some other den,
       And worse off than we hitherto have been;
     Besides, I 'm hungry, and just now would take,
     Like Esau, for my birthright a beef-steak.

     'We must be near some place of man's abode;--
       For the old negro's confidence in creeping,
     With his two captives, by so queer a road,
       Shows that he thinks his friends have not been sleeping;
     A single cry would bring them all abroad:
       'T is therefore better looking before leaping--
     And there, you see, this turn has brought us through,
     By Jove, a noble palace!--lighted too.'

     It was indeed a wide extensive building
       Which open'd on their view, and o'er the front
     There seem'd to be besprent a deal of gilding
       And various hues, as is the Turkish wont,--
     A gaudy taste; for they are little skill'd in
       The arts of which these lands were once the font:
     Each villa on the Bosphorus looks a screen
     New painted, or a pretty opera-scene.

     And nearer as they came, a genial savour
       Of certain stews, and roast-meats, and pilaus,
     Things which in hungry mortals' eyes find favour,
       Made Juan in his harsh intentions pause,
     And put himself upon his good behaviour:
       His friend, too, adding a new saving clause,
     Said, 'In Heaven's name let's get some supper now,
     And then I 'm with you, if you 're for a row.'

     Some talk of an appeal unto some passion,
       Some to men's feelings, others to their reason;
     The last of these was never much the fashion,
       For reason thinks all reasoning out of season.
     Some speakers whine, and others lay the lash on,
       But more or less continue still to tease on,
     With arguments according to their 'forte;'
     But no one dreams of ever being short.-

     But I digress: of all appeals,--although
       I grant the power of pathos, and of gold,
     Of beauty, flattery, threats, a shilling,--no
       Method 's more sure at moments to take hold
     Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow
       More tender, as we every day behold,
     Than that all-softening, overpowering knell,
     The tocsin of the soul--the dinner-bell.

     Turkey contains no bells, and yet men dine;
       And Juan and his friend, albeit they heard
     No Christian knoll to table, saw no line
       Of lackeys usher to the feast prepared,
     Yet smelt roast-meat, beheld a huge fire shine,
       And cooks in motion with their clean arms bared,
     And gazed around them to the left and right
     With the prophetic eye of appetite.

     And giving up all notions of resistance,
       They follow'd close behind their sable guide,
     Who little thought that his own crack'd existence
       Was on the point of being set aside:
     He motion'd them to stop at some small distance,
       And knocking at the gate, 't was open'd wide,
     And a magnificent large hall display'd
     The Asian pomp of Ottoman parade.

     I won't describe; description is my forte,
       But every fool describes in these bright days
     His wondrous journey to some foreign court,
       And spawns his quarto, and demands your praise--
     Death to his publisher, to him 't is sport;
       While Nature, tortured twenty thousand ways,
     Resigns herself with exemplary patience
     To guide-books, rhymes, tours, sketches, illustrations.

     Along this hall, and up and down, some, squatted
       Upon their hams, were occupied at chess;
     Others in monosyllable talk chatted,
       And some seem'd much in love with their own dress.
     And divers smoked superb pipes decorated
       With amber mouths of greater price or less;
     And several strutted, others slept, and some
     Prepared for supper with a glass of rum.

     As the black eunuch enter'd with his brace
       Of purchased Infidels, some raised their eyes
     A moment without slackening from their pace;
       But those who sate ne'er stirr'd in anywise:
     One or two stared the captives in the face,
       Just as one views a horse to guess his price;
     Some nodded to the negro from their station,
     But no one troubled him with conversation.

     He leads them through the hall, and, without stopping,
       On through a farther range of goodly rooms,
     Splendid but silent, save in one, where, dropping,
       A marble fountain echoes through the glooms
     Of night which robe the chamber, or where popping
       Some female head most curiously presumes
     To thrust its black eyes through the door or lattice,
     As wondering what the devil a noise that is.

     Some faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls
       Gave light enough to hint their farther way,
     But not enough to show the imperial halls,
       In all the flashing of their full array;
     Perhaps there 's nothing--I 'll not say appals,
       But saddens more by night as well as day,
     Than an enormous room without a soul
     To break the lifeless splendour of the whole.

     Two or three seem so little, one seems nothing:
       In deserts, forests, crowds, or by the shore,
     There solitude, we know, has her full growth in
       The spots which were her realms for evermore;
     But in a mighty hall or gallery, both in
       More modern buildings and those built of yore,
     A kind of death comes o'er us all alone,
     Seeing what 's meant for many with but one.

     A neat, snug study on a winter's night,
       A book, friend, single lady, or a glass
     Of claret, sandwich, and an appetite,
       Are things which make an English evening pass;
     Though certes by no means so grand a sight
       As is a theatre lit up by gas.
     I pass my evenings in long galleries solely,
     And that 's the reason I 'm so melancholy.

     Alas! man makes that great which makes him little:
       I grant you in a church 't is very well:
     What speaks of Heaven should by no means be brittle,
       But strong and lasting, till no tongue can tell
     Their names who rear'd it; but huge houses fit ill--
       And huge tombs worse--mankind, since Adam fell:
     Methinks the story of the tower of Babel
     Might teach them this much better than I 'm able.

     Babel was Nimrod's hunting-box, and then
       A town of gardens, walls, and wealth amazing,
     Where Nabuchadonosor, king of men,
       Reign'd, till one summer's day he took to grazing,
     And Daniel tamed the lions in their den,
       The people's awe and admiration raising;
     'T was famous, too, for Thisbe and for Pyramus,
     And the calumniated queen Semiramis.

     That injured Queen by chroniclers so coarse
       Has been accused (I doubt not by conspiracy)
     Of an improper friendship for her horse
       (Love, like religion, sometimes runs to heresy):
     This monstrous tale had probably its source
       (For such exaggerations here and there I see)
     In writing 'Courser' by mistake for 'Courier:'
     I wish the case could come before a jury here.

     But to resume,--should there be (what may not
       Be in these days?) some infidels, who don't,
     Because they can't find out the very spot
       Of that same Babel, or because they won't
     (Though Claudius Rich, Esquire, some bricks has got,
       And written lately two memoirs upon't),
     Believe the Jews, those unbelievers, who
     Must be believed, though they believe not you,

     Yet let them think that Horace has exprest
       Shortly and sweetly the masonic folly
     Of those, forgetting the great place of rest,
       Who give themselves to architecture wholly;
     We know where things and men must end at best:
       A moral (like all morals) melancholy,
     And 'Et sepulchri immemor struis domos'
     Shows that we build when we should but entomb us.

     At last they reach'd a quarter most retired,
       Where echo woke as if from a long slumber;
     Though full of all things which could be desired,
       One wonder'd what to do with such a number
     Of articles which nobody required;
       Here wealth had done its utmost to encumber
     With furniture an exquisite apartment,
     Which puzzled Nature much to know what Art meant.

     It seem'd, however, but to open on
       A range or suite of further chambers, which
     Might lead to heaven knows where; but in this one
       The movables were prodigally rich:
     Sofas 't was half a sin to sit upon,
       So costly were they; carpets every stitch
     Of workmanship so rare, they made you wish
     You could glide o'er them like a golden fish.

     The black, however, without hardly deigning
       A glance at that which wrapt the slaves in wonder,
     Trampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining,
       As if the milky way their feet was under
     With all its stars; and with a stretch attaining
       A certain press or cupboard niched in yonder--
     In that remote recess which you may see--
     Or if you don't the fault is not in me,--

     I wish to be perspicuous; and the black,
       I say, unlocking the recess, pull'd forth
     A quantity of clothes fit for the back
       Of any Mussulman, whate'er his worth;
     And of variety there was no lack--
       And yet, though I have said there was no dearth,
     He chose himself to point out what he thought
     Most proper for the Christians he had bought.

     The suit he thought most suitable to each
       Was, for the elder and the stouter, first
     A Candiote cloak, which to the knee might reach,
       And trousers not so tight that they would burst,
     But such as fit an Asiatic breech;
       A shawl, whose folds in Cashmire had been nurst,
     Slippers of saffron, dagger rich and handy;
     In short, all things which form a Turkish Dandy.

     While he was dressing, Baba, their black friend,
       Hinted the vast advantages which they
     Might probably attain both in the end,
       If they would but pursue the proper way
     Which fortune plainly seem'd to recommend;
       And then he added, that he needs must say,
     ''T would greatly tend to better their condition,
     If they would condescend to circumcision.

     'For his own part, he really should rejoice
       To see them true believers, but no less
     Would leave his proposition to their choice.'
       The other, thanking him for this excess
     Of goodness, in thus leaving them a voice
       In such a trifle, scarcely could express
     'Sufficiently' (he said) 'his approbation
     Of all the customs of this polish'd nation.

     'For his own share--he saw but small objection
       To so respectable an ancient rite;
     And, after swallowing down a slight refection,
       For which he own'd a present appetite,
     He doubted not a few hours of reflection
       Would reconcile him to the business quite.'
     'Will it?' said Juan, sharply: 'Strike me dead,
     But they as soon shall circumcise my head!

     'Cut off a thousand heads, before-'--'Now, pray,'
       Replied the other, 'do not interrupt:
     You put me out in what I had to say.
       Sir!--as I said, as soon as I have supt,
     I shall perpend if your proposal may
       Be such as I can properly accept;
     Provided always your great goodness still
     Remits the matter to our own free-will.'

     Baba eyed Juan, and said, 'Be so good
       As dress yourself-' and pointed out a suit
     In which a Princess with great pleasure would
       Array her limbs; but Juan standing mute,
     As not being in a masquerading mood,
       Gave it a slight kick with his Christian foot;
     And when the old negro told him to 'Get ready,'
     Replied, 'Old gentleman, I 'm not a lady.'

     'What you may be, I neither know nor care,'
       Said Baba; 'but pray do as I desire:
     I have no more time nor many words to spare.'
       'At least,' said Juan, 'sure I may enquire
     The cause of this odd travesty?'--'Forbear,'
       Said Baba, 'to be curious; 't will transpire,
     No doubt, in proper place, and time, and season:
     I have no authority to tell the reason.'

     'Then if I do,' said Juan, 'I 'll be-'--'Hold!'
       Rejoin'd the negro, 'pray be not provoking;
     This spirit 's well, but it may wax too bold,
       And you will find us not top fond of joking.'
     'What, sir!' said Juan, 'shall it e'er be told
       That I unsex'd my dress?' But Baba, stroking
     The things down, said, 'Incense me, and I call
     Those who will leave you of no sex at all.

     'I offer you a handsome suit of clothes:
       A woman's, true; but then there is a cause
     Why you should wear them.'--'What, though my soul loathes
       The effeminate garb?'--thus, after a short pause,
     Sigh'd Juan, muttering also some slight oaths,
       'What the devil shall I do with all this gauze?'
     Thus he profanely term'd the finest lace
     Which e'er set off a marriage-morning face.

     And then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipp'd
       A pair of trousers of flesh-colour'd silk;
     Next with a virgin zone he was equipp'd,
       Which girt a slight chemise as white as milk;
     But tugging on his petticoat, he tripp'd,
       Which--as we say--or, as the Scotch say, whilk
     (The rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes
     Monarchs are less imperative than rhymes)--

     Whilk, which (or what you please), was owing to
       His garment's novelty, and his being awkward:
     And yet at last he managed to get through
       His toilet, though no doubt a little backward:
     The negro Baba help'd a little too,
       When some untoward part of raiment stuck hard;
     And, wrestling both his arms into a gown,
     He paused, and took a survey up and down.

     One difficulty still remain'd--his hair
       Was hardly long enough; but Baba found
     So many false long tresses all to spare,
       That soon his head was most completely crown'd,
     After the manner then in fashion there;
       And this addition with such gems was bound
     As suited the ensemble of his toilet,
     While Baba made him comb his head and oil it.

     And now being femininely all array'd,
       With some small aid from scissors, paint, and tweezers,
     He look'd in almost all respects a maid,
       And Baba smilingly exclaim'd, 'You see, sirs,
     A perfect transformation here display'd;
       And now, then, you must come along with me, sirs,
     That is--the Lady:' clapping his hands twice,
     Four blacks were at his elbow in a trice.

     'You, sir,' said Baba, nodding to the one,
       'Will please to accompany those gentlemen
     To supper; but you, worthy Christian nun,
       Will follow me: no trifling, sir; for when
     I say a thing, it must at once be done.
       What fear you? think you this a lion's den?
     Why, 't is a palace; where the truly wise
     Anticipate the Prophet's paradise.

     'You fool! I tell you no one means you harm.'
       'So much the better,' Juan said, 'for them;
     Else they shall feel the weight of this my arm,
       Which is not quite so light as you may deem.
     I yield thus far; but soon will break the charm
       If any take me for that which I seem:
     So that I trust for everybody's sake,
     That this disguise may lead to no mistake.'

     'Blockhead! come on, and see,' quoth Baba; while
       Don Juan, turning to his comrade, who
     Though somewhat grieved, could scarce forbear a smile
       Upon the metamorphosis in view,--
     'Farewell!' they mutually exclaim'd: 'this soil
       Seems fertile in adventures strange and new;
     One 's turn'd half Mussulman, and one a maid,
     By this old black enchanter's unsought aid.'

     'Farewell!' said Juan: 'should we meet no more,
       I wish you a good appetite.'--'Farewell!'
     Replied the other; 'though it grieves me sore;
       When we next meet we 'll have a tale to tell:
     We needs must follow when Fate puts from shore.
       Keep your good name; though Eve herself once fell.'
     'Nay,' quoth the maid, 'the Sultan's self shan't carry me,
     Unless his highness promises to marry me.

     And thus they parted, each by separate doors;
       Baba led Juan onward room by room
     Through glittering galleries and o'er marble floors,
       Till a gigantic portal through the gloom,
     Haughty and huge, along the distance lowers;
       And wafted far arose a rich perfume:
     It seem'd as though they came upon a shrine,
     For all was vast, still, fragrant, and divine.

     The giant door was broad, and bright, and high,
       Of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise;
     Warriors thereon were battling furiously;
       Here stalks the victor, there the vanquish'd lies;
     There captives led in triumph droop the eye,
       And in perspective many a squadron flies:
     It seems the work of times before the line
     Of Rome transplanted fell with Constantine.

     This massy portal stood at the wide close
       Of a huge hall, and on its either side
     Two little dwarfs, the least you could suppose,
       Were sate, like ugly imps, as if allied
     In mockery to the enormous gate which rose
       O'er them in almost pyramidic pride:
     The gate so splendid was in all its features,
     You never thought about those little creatures,

     Until you nearly trod on them, and then
       You started back in horror to survey
     The wondrous hideousness of those small men,
       Whose colour was not black, nor white, nor grey,
     But an extraneous mixture, which no pen
       Can trace, although perhaps the pencil may;
     They were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb--
     Monsters, who cost a no less monstrous sum.

     Their duty was--for they were strong, and though
       They look'd so little, did strong things at times--
     To ope this door, which they could really do,
       The hinges being as smooth as Rogers' rhymes;
     And now and then, with tough strings of the bow,
       As is the custom of those Eastern climes,
     To give some rebel Pacha a cravat;
     For mutes are generally used for that.

     They spoke by signs--that is, not spoke at all;
       And looking like two incubi, they glared
     As Baba with his fingers made them fall
       To heaving back the portal folds: it scared
     Juan a moment, as this pair so small
       With shrinking serpent optics on him stared;
     It was as if their little looks could poison
     Or fascinate whome'er they fix'd their eyes on.

     Before they enter'd, Baba paused to hint
       To Juan some slight lessons as his guide:
     'If you could just contrive,' he said, 'to stint
       That somewhat manly majesty of stride,
     'T would be as well, and (though there 's not much in 't)
       To swing a little less from side to side,
     Which has at times an aspect of the oddest;--
     And also could you look a little modest,

     ''T would be convenient; for these mutes have eyes
       Like needles, which may pierce those petticoats;
     And if they should discover your disguise,
       You know how near us the deep Bosphorus floats;
     And you and I may chance, ere morning rise,
       To find our way to Marmora without boats,
     Stitch'd up in sacks--a mode of navigation
     A good deal practised here upon occasion.'

     With this encouragement, he led the way
       Into a room still nobler than the last;
     A rich confusion form'd a disarray
       In such sort, that the eye along it cast
     Could hardly carry anything away,
       Object on object flash'd so bright and fast;
     A dazzling mass of gems, and gold, and glitter,
     Magnificently mingled in a litter.

     Wealth had done wonders--taste not much; such things
       Occur in Orient palaces, and even
     In the more chasten'd domes of Western kings
       (Of which I have also seen some six or seven),
     Where I can't say or gold or diamond flings
       Great lustre, there is much to be forgiven;
     Groups of bad statues, tables, chairs, and pictures,
     On which I cannot pause to make my strictures.

     In this imperial hall, at distance lay
       Under a canopy, and there reclined
     Quite in a confidential queenly way,
       A lady; Baba stopp'd, and kneeling sign'd
     To Juan, who though not much used to pray,
       Knelt down by instinct, wondering in his mind,
     What all this meant: while Baba bow'd and bended
     His head, until the ceremony ended.

     The lady rising up with such an air
       As Venus rose with from the wave, on them
     Bent like an antelope a Paphian pair
       Of eyes, which put out each surrounding gem;
     And raising up an arm as moonlight fair,
       She sign'd to Baba, who first kiss'd the hem
     Of her deep purple robe, and speaking low,
     Pointed to Juan who remain'd below.

     Her presence was as lofty as her state;
       Her beauty of that overpowering kind,
     Whose force description only would abate:
       I 'd rather leave it much to your own mind,
     Than lessen it by what I could relate
       Of forms and features; it would strike you blind
     Could I do justice to the full detail;
     So, luckily for both, my phrases fail.

     Thus much however I may add,--her years
       Were ripe, they might make six-and-twenty springs;
     But there are forms which Time to touch forbears,
       And turns aside his scythe to vulgar things,
     Such as was Mary's Queen of Scots; true--tears
       And love destroy; and sapping sorrow wrings
     Charms from the charmer, yet some never grow
     Ugly; for instance--Ninon de l'Enclos.

     She spake some words to her attendants, who
       Composed a choir of girls, ten or a dozen,
     And were all clad alike; like Juan, too,
       Who wore their uniform, by Baba chosen;
     They form'd a very nymph-like looking crew,
       Which might have call'd Diana's chorus 'cousin,'
     As far as outward show may correspond;
     I won't be bail for anything beyond.

     They bow'd obeisance and withdrew, retiring,
       But not by the same door through which came in
     Baba and Juan, which last stood admiring,
       At some small distance, all he saw within
     This strange saloon, much fitted for inspiring
       Marvel and praise; for both or none things win;
     And I must say, I ne'er could see the very
     Great happiness of the 'Nil Admirari.'

     'Not to admire is all the art I know
       (Plain truth, dear Murray, needs few flowers of speech)
     To make men happy, or to keep them so'
       (So take it in the very words of Creech)--
     Thus Horace wrote we all know long ago;
       And thus Pope quotes the precept to re-teach
     From his translation; but had none admired,
     Would Pope have sung, or Horace been inspired?

     Baba, when all the damsels were withdrawn,
       Motion'd to Juan to approach, and then
     A second time desired him to kneel down,
       And kiss the lady's foot; which maxim when
     He heard repeated, Juan with a frown
       Drew himself up to his full height again,
     And said, 'It grieved him, but he could not stoop
     To any shoe, unless it shod the Pope.'

     Baba, indignant at this ill-timed pride,
       Made fierce remonstrances, and then a threat
     He mutter'd (but the last was given aside)
       About a bow-string--quite in vain; not yet
     Would Juan bend, though 't were to Mahomet's bride:
       There 's nothing in the world like etiquette
     In kingly chambers or imperial halls,
     As also at the race and county balls.

     He stood like Atlas, with a world of words
       About his ears, and nathless would not bend:
     The blood of all his line 's Castilian lords
       Boil'd in his veins, and rather than descend
     To stain his pedigree a thousand swords
       A thousand times of him had made an end;
     At length perceiving the 'foot' could not stand,
     Baba proposed that he should kiss the hand.

     Here was an honourable compromise,
       A half-way house of diplomatic rest,
     Where they might meet in much more peaceful guise;
       And Juan now his willingness exprest
     To use all fit and proper courtesies,
       Adding, that this was commonest and best,
     For through the South the custom still commands
     The gentleman to kiss the lady's hands.

     And he advanced, though with but a bad grace,
       Though on more thorough-bred or fairer fingers
     No lips e'er left their transitory trace;
       On such as these the lip too fondly lingers,
     And for one kiss would fain imprint a brace,
       As you will see, if she you love shall bring hers
     In contact; and sometimes even a fair stranger's
     An almost twelvemonth's constancy endangers.

     The lady eyed him o'er and o'er, and bade
       Baba retire, which he obey'd in style,
     As if well used to the retreating trade;
       And taking hints in good part all the while,
     He whisper'd Juan not to be afraid,
       And looking on him with a sort of smile,
     Took leave, with such a face of satisfaction
     As good men wear who have done a virtuous action.

     When he was gone, there was a sudden change:
       I know not what might be the lady's thought,
     But o'er her bright brow flash'd a tumult strange,
       And into her dear cheek the blood was brought,
     Blood-red as sunset summer clouds which range
       The verge of Heaven; and in her large eyes wrought,
     A mixture of sensations might be scann'd,
     Of half voluptuousness and half command.

     Her form had all the softness of her sex,
       Her features all the sweetness of the devil,
     When he put on the cherub to perplex
       Eve, and paved (God knows how) the road to evil;
     The sun himself was scarce more free from specks
       Than she from aught at which the eye could cavil;
     Yet, somehow, there was something somewhere wanting,
     As if she rather order'd than was granting.

     Something imperial, or imperious, threw
       A chain o'er all she did; that is, a chain
     Was thrown as 't were about the neck of you,--
       And rapture's self will seem almost a pain
     With aught which looks like despotism in view:
       Our souls at least are free, and 't is in vain
     We would against them make the flesh obey--
     The spirit in the end will have its way.

     Her very smile was haughty, though so sweet;
       Her very nod was not an inclination;
     There was a self-will even in her small feet,
       As though they were quite conscious of her station--
     They trod as upon necks; and to complete
       Her state (it is the custom of her nation),
     A poniard deck'd her girdle, as the sign
     She was a sultan's bride (thank Heaven, not mine!).

     'To hear and to obey' had been from birth
       The law of all around her; to fulfill
     All phantasies which yielded joy or mirth,
       Had been her slaves' chief pleasure, as her will;
     Her blood was high, her beauty scarce of earth:
       Judge, then, if her caprices e'er stood still;
     Had she but been a Christian, I 've a notion
     We should have found out the 'perpetual motion.'

     Whate'er she saw and coveted was brought;
       Whate'er she did not see, if she supposed
     It might be seen, with diligence was sought,
       And when 't was found straightway the bargain closed;
     There was no end unto the things she bought,
       Nor to the trouble which her fancies caused;
     Yet even her tyranny had such a grace,
     The women pardon'd all except her face.

     Juan, the latest of her whims, had caught
       Her eye in passing on his way to sale;
     She order'd him directly to be bought,
       And Baba, who had ne'er been known to fail
     In any kind of mischief to be wrought,
       At all such auctions knew how to prevail:
     She had no prudence, but he had; and this
     Explains the garb which Juan took amiss.

     His youth and features favour'd the disguise,
       And, should you ask how she, a sultan's bride,
     Could risk or compass such strange phantasies,
       This I must leave sultanas to decide:
     Emperors are only husbands in wives' eyes,
       And kings and consorts oft are mystified,
     As we may ascertain with due precision,
     Some by experience, others by tradition.

     But to the main point, where we have been tending:--
       She now conceived all difficulties past,
     And deem'd herself extremely condescending
       When, being made her property at last,
     Without more preface, in her blue eyes blending
       Passion and power, a glance on him she cast,
     And merely saying, 'Christian, canst thou love?'
     Conceived that phrase was quite enough to move

     And so it was, in proper time and place;
       But Juan, who had still his mind o'erflowing
     With Haidee's isle and soft Ionian face,
       Felt the warm blood, which in his face was glowing,
     Rush back upon his heart, which fill'd apace,
       And left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing;
     These words went through his soul like Arab-spears,
     So that he spoke not, but burst into tears.

     She was a good deal shock'd; not shock'd at tears,
       For women shed and use them at their liking;
     But there is something when man's eye appears
       Wet, still more disagreeable and striking;
     A woman's tear-drop melts, a man's half sears,
       Like molten lead, as if you thrust a pike in
     His heart to force it out, for (to be shorter)
     To them 't is a relief, to us a torture.

     And she would have consoled, but knew not how:
       Having no equals, nothing which had e'er
     Infected her with sympathy till now,
       And never having dreamt what 't was to bear
     Aught of a serious, sorrowing kind, although
       There might arise some pouting petty care
     To cross her brow, she wonder'd how so near
     Her eyes another's eye could shed a tear.

     But nature teaches more than power can spoil,
       And, when a strong although a strange sensation
     Moves--female hearts are such a genial soil
       For kinder feelings, whatsoe'er their nation,
     They naturally pour the 'wine and oil,'
       Samaritans in every situation;
     And thus Gulbeyaz, though she knew not why,
     Felt an odd glistening moisture in her eye.

     But tears must stop like all things else; and soon
       Juan, who for an instant had been moved
     To such a sorrow by the intrusive tone
       Of one who dared to ask if 'he had loved,'
     Call'd back the stoic to his eyes, which shone
       Bright with the very weakness he reproved;
     And although sensitive to beauty, he
     Felt most indignant still at not being free.

     Gulbeyaz, for the first time in her days,
       Was much embarrass'd, never having met
     In all her life with aught save prayers and praise;
       And as she also risk'd her life to get
     Him whom she meant to tutor in love's ways
       Into a comfortable tete-a-tete,
     To lose the hour would make her quite a martyr,
     And they had wasted now almost a quarter.

     I also would suggest the fitting time
       To gentlemen in any such like case,
     That is to say in a meridian clime--
       With us there is more law given to the chase,
     But here a small delay forms a great crime:
       So recollect that the extremest grace
     Is just two minutes for your declaration--
     A moment more would hurt your reputation.

     Juan's was good; and might have been still better,
       But he had got Haidee into his head:
     However strange, he could not yet forget her,
       Which made him seem exceedingly ill-bred.
     Gulbeyaz, who look'd on him as her debtor
       For having had him to her palace led,
     Began to blush up to the eyes, and then
     Grow deadly pale, and then blush back again.

     At length, in an imperial way, she laid
       Her hand on his, and bending on him eyes
     Which needed not an empire to persuade,
       Look'd into his for love, where none replies:
     Her brow grew black, but she would not upbraid,
       That being the last thing a proud woman tries;
     She rose, and pausing one chaste moment, threw
     Herself upon his breast, and there she grew.

     This was an awkward test, as Juan found,
       But he was steel'd by sorrow, wrath, and pride:
     With gentle force her white arms he unwound,
       And seated her all drooping by his side,
     Then rising haughtily he glanced around,
       And looking coldly in her face, he cried,
     'The prison'd eagle will not pair, nor
     Serve a Sultana's sensual phantasy.

     'Thou ask'st if I can love? be this the proof
       How much I have loved--that I love not thee!
     In this vile garb, the distaff, web, and woof,
       Were fitter for me: Love is for the free!
     I am not dazzled by this splendid roof,
       Whate'er thy power, and great it seems to be;
     Heads bow, knees bend, eyes watch around a throne,
     And hands obey--our hearts are still our own.'

     This was a truth to us extremely trite;
       Not so to her, who ne'er had heard such things:
     She deem'd her least command must yield delight,
       Earth being only made for queens and kings.
     If hearts lay on the left side or the right
       She hardly knew, to such perfection brings
     Legitimacy its born votaries, when
     Aware of their due royal rights o'er men.

     Besides, as has been said, she was so fair
       As even in a much humbler lot had made
     A kingdom or confusion anywhere,
       And also, as may be presumed, she laid
     Some stress on charms, which seldom are, if e'er,
       By their possessors thrown into the shade:
     She thought hers gave a double 'right divine;'
     And half of that opinion 's also mine.

     Remember, or (if you can not) imagine,
       Ye, who have kept your chastity when young,
     While some more desperate dowager has been waging
       Love with you, and been in the dog-days stung
     By your refusal, recollect her raging!
       Or recollect all that was said or sung
     On such a subject; then suppose the face
     Of a young downright beauty in this case.

     Suppose,--but you already have supposed,
       The spouse of Potiphar, the Lady Booby,
     Phaedra, and all which story has disclosed
       Of good examples; pity that so few by
     Poets and private tutors are exposed,
       To educate--ye youth of Europe--you by!
     But when you have supposed the few we know,
     You can't suppose Gulbeyaz' angry brow.

     A tigress robb'd of young, a lioness,
       Or any interesting beast of prey,
     Are similes at hand for the distress
       Of ladies who can not have their own way;
     But though my turn will not be served with less,
       These don't express one half what I should say:
     For what is stealing young ones, few or many,
     To cutting short their hopes of having any?

     The love of offspring 's nature's general law,
       From tigresses and cubs to ducks and ducklings;
     There 's nothing whets the beak, or arms the claw
       Like an invasion of their babes and sucklings;
     And all who have seen a human nursery, saw
       How mothers love their children's squalls and chucklings;
     This strong extreme effect (to tire no longer
     Your patience) shows the cause must still be stronger.

     If I said fire flash'd from Gulbeyaz' eyes,
       'T were nothing--for her eyes flash'd always fire;
     Or said her cheeks assumed the deepest dyes,
       I should but bring disgrace upon the dyer,
     So supernatural was her passion's rise;
       For ne'er till now she knew a check'd desire:
     Even ye who know what a check'd woman is
     (Enough, God knows!) would much fall short of this.

     Her rage was but a minute's, and 't was well--
       A moment's more had slain her; but the while
     It lasted 't was like a short glimpse of hell:
       Nought 's more sublime than energetic bile,
     Though horrible to see yet grand to tell,
       Like ocean warring 'gainst a rocky isle;
     And the deep passions flashing through her form
     Made her a beautiful embodied storm.

     A vulgar tempest 't were to a typhoon
       To match a common fury with her rage,
     And yet she did not want to reach the moon,
       Like moderate Hotspur on the immortal page;
     Her anger pitch'd into a lower tune,
       Perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age--
     Her wish was but to 'kill, kill, kill,' like Lear's,
     And then her thirst of blood was quench'd in tears.

     A storm it raged, and like the storm it pass'd,
       Pass'd without words--in fact she could not speak;
     And then her sex's shame broke in at last,
       A sentiment till then in her but weak,
     But now it flow'd in natural and fast,
       As water through an unexpected leak;
     For she felt humbled--and humiliation
     Is sometimes good for people in her station

     It teaches them that they are flesh and blood,
       It also gently hints to them that others,
     Although of clay, are yet not quite of mud;
       That urns and pipkins are but fragile brothers,
     And works of the same pottery, bad or good,
       Though not all born of the same sires and mothers:
     It teaches--Heaven knows only what it teaches,
     But sometimes it may mend, and often reaches.

     Her first thought was to cut off Juan's head;
       Her second, to cut only his--acquaintance;
     Her third, to ask him where he had been bred;
       Her fourth, to rally him into repentance;
     Her fifth, to call her maids and go to bed;
       Her sixth, to stab herself; her seventh, to sentence
     The lash to Baba:--but her grand resource
     Was to sit down again, and cry of course.

     She thought to stab herself, but then she had
       The dagger close at hand, which made it awkward;
     For Eastern stays are little made to pad,
       So that a poniard pierces if 't is stuck hard:
     She thought of killing Juan--but, poor lad!
       Though he deserved it well for being so backward,
     The cutting off his head was not the art
     Most likely to attain her aim--his heart.

     Juan was moved; he had made up his mind
       To be impaled, or quarter'd as a dish
     For dogs, or to be slain with pangs refined,
       Or thrown to lions, or made baits for fish,
     And thus heroically stood resign'd,
       Rather than sin--except to his own wish:
     But all his great preparatives for dying
     Dissolved like snow before a woman crying.

     As through his palms Bob Acres' valour oozed,
       So Juan's virtue ebb'd, I know not how;
     And first he wonder'd why he had refused;
       And then, if matters could be made up now;
     And next his savage virtue he accused,
       Just as a friar may accuse his vow,
     Or as a dame repents her of her oath,
     Which mostly ends in some small breach of both.

     So he began to stammer some excuses;
       But words are not enough in such a matter,
     Although you borrow'd all that e'er the muses
       Have sung, or even a Dandy's dandiest chatter,
     Or all the figures Castlereagh abuses;
       Just as a languid smile began to flatter
     His peace was making, but before he ventured
     Further, old Baba rather briskly enter'd.

     'Bride of the Sun! and Sister of the Moon!'
       ('T was thus he spake) 'and Empress of the Earth!
     Whose frown would put the spheres all out of tune,
       Whose smile makes all the planets dance with mirth,
     Your slave brings tidings--he hopes not too soon--
       Which your sublime attention may be worth:
     The Sun himself has sent me like a ray,
     To hint that he is coming up this way.'

     'Is it,' exclaim'd Gulbeyaz, 'as you say?
       I wish to heaven he would not shine till morning!
     But bid my women form the milky way.
       Hence, my old comet! give the stars due warning--
     And, Christian! mingle with them as you may,
       And as you 'd have me pardon your past scorning-'
     Here they were interrupted by a humming
     Sound, and then by a cry, 'The Sultan 's coming!'

     First came her damsels, a decorous file,
       And then his Highness' eunuchs, black and white;
     The train might reach a quarter of a mile:
       His majesty was always so polite
     As to announce his visits a long while
       Before he came, especially at night;
     For being the last wife of the Emperour,
     She was of course the favorite of the four.

     His Highness was a man of solemn port,
       Shawl'd to the nose, and bearded to the eyes,
     Snatch'd from a prison to preside at court,
       His lately bowstrung brother caused his rise;
     He was as good a sovereign of the sort
       As any mention'd in the histories
     Of Cantemir, or Knolles, where few shine
     Save Solyman, the glory of their line.

     He went to mosque in state, and said his prayers
       With more than 'Oriental scrupulosity;'
     He left to his vizier all state affairs,
       And show'd but little royal curiosity:
     I know not if he had domestic cares--
       No process proved connubial animosity;
     Four wives and twice five hundred maids, unseen,
     Were ruled as calmly as a Christian queen.

     If now and then there happen'd a slight slip,
       Little was heard of criminal or crime;
     The story scarcely pass'd a single lip--
       The sack and sea had settled all in time,
     From which the secret nobody could rip:
       The Public knew no more than does this rhyme;
     No scandals made the daily press a curse--
     Morals were better, and the fish no worse.

     He saw with his own eyes the moon was round,
       Was also certain that the earth was square,
     Because he had journey'd fifty miles, and found
       No sign that it was circular anywhere;
     His empire also was without a bound:
       'T is true, a little troubled here and there,
     By rebel pachas, and encroaching giaours,
     But then they never came to 'the Seven Towers;'

     Except in shape of envoys, who were sent
       To lodge there when a war broke out, according
     To the true law of nations, which ne'er meant
       Those scoundrels, who have never had a sword in
     Their dirty diplomatic hands, to vent
       Their spleen in making strife, and safely wording
     Their lies, yclep'd despatches, without risk or
     The singeing of a single inky whisker.

     He had fifty daughters and four dozen sons,
       Of whom all such as came of age were stow'd,
     The former in a palace, where like nuns
       They lived till some Bashaw was sent abroad,
     When she, whose turn it was, was wed at once,
       Sometimes at six years old--though it seems odd,
     'T is true; the reason is, that the Bashaw
     Must make a present to his sire in law.

     His sons were kept in prison, till they grew
       Of years to fill a bowstring or the throne,
     One or the other, but which of the two
       Could yet be known unto the fates alone;
     Meantime the education they went through
       Was princely, as the proofs have always shown:
     So that the heir apparent still was found
     No less deserving to be hang'd than crown'd.

     His majesty saluted his fourth spouse
       With all the ceremonies of his rank,
     Who clear'd her sparkling eyes and smooth'd her brows,
       As suits a matron who has play'd a prank;
     These must seem doubly mindful of their vows,
       To save the credit of their breaking bank:
     To no men are such cordial greetings given
     As those whose wives have made them fit for heaven.

     His Highness cast around his great black eyes,
       And looking, as he always look'd, perceived
     Juan amongst the damsels in disguise,
       At which he seem'd no whit surprised nor grieved,
     But just remark'd with air sedate and wise,
       While still a fluttering sigh Gulbeyaz heaved,
     'I see you 've bought another girl; 't is pity
     That a mere Christian should be half so pretty.'

     This compliment, which drew all eyes upon
       The new-bought virgin, made her blush and shake.
     Her comrades, also, thought themselves undone:
       O! Mahomet! that his majesty should take
     Such notice of a giaour, while scarce to one
       Of them his lips imperial ever spake!
     There was a general whisper, toss, and wriggle,
     But etiquette forbade them all to giggle.

     The Turks do well to shut--at least, sometimes--
       The women up, because, in sad reality,
     Their chastity in these unhappy climes
       Is not a thing of that astringent quality
     Which in the North prevents precocious crimes,
       And makes our snow less pure than our morality;
     The sun, which yearly melts the polar ice,
     Has quite the contrary effect on vice.

     Thus in the East they are extremely strict,
       And Wedlock and a Padlock mean the same;
     Excepting only when the former 's pick'd
       It ne'er can be replaced in proper frame;
     Spoilt, as a pipe of claret is when prick'd:
       But then their own Polygamy 's to blame;
     Why don't they knead two virtuous souls for life
     Into that moral centaur, man and wife?

     Thus far our chronicle; and now we pause,
       Though not for want of matter; but 't is time
     According to the ancient epic laws,
       To slacken sail, and anchor with our rhyme.
     Let this fifth canto meet with due applause,
       The sixth shall have a touch of the sublime;
     Meanwhile, as Homer sometimes sleeps, perhaps
     You 'll pardon to my muse a few short naps.




CANTO THE SIXTH.

    'There is a tide in the affairs of men
       Which,--taken at the flood,'--you know the rest,
     And most of us have found it now and then;
       At least we think so, though but few have guess'd
     The moment, till too late to come again.
       But no doubt every thing is for the best--
     Of which the surest sign is in the end:
     When things are at the worst they sometimes mend.

     There is a tide in the affairs of women
       Which, taken at the flood, leads--God knows where:
     Those navigators must be able seamen
       Whose charts lay down its current to a hair;
     Not all the reveries of Jacob Behmen
       With its strange whirls and eddies can compare:
     Men with their heads reflect on this and that--
     But women with their hearts on heaven knows what!

     And yet a headlong, headstrong, downright she,
       Young, beautiful, and daring--who would risk
     A throne, the world, the universe, to be
       Beloved in her own way, and rather whisk
     The stars from out the sky, than not be free
       As are the billows when the breeze is brisk--
     Though such a she 's a devil (if that there be one),
     Yet she would make full many a Manichean.

     Thrones, worlds, et cetera, are so oft upset
       By commonest ambition, that when passion
     O'erthrows the same, we readily forget,
       Or at the least forgive, the loving rash one.
     If Antony be well remember'd yet,
       'Tis not his conquests keep his name in fashion,
     But Actium, lost for Cleopatra's eyes,
     Outbalances all Caesar's victories.

     He died at fifty for a queen of forty;
       I wish their years had been fifteen and twenty,
     For then wealth, kingdoms, worlds are but a sport--I
       Remember when, though I had no great plenty
     Of worlds to lose, yet still, to pay my court, I
       Gave what I had--a heart: as the world went, I
     Gave what was worth a world; for worlds could never
     Restore me those pure feelings, gone forever.

     'Twas the boy's 'mite,' and, like the 'widow's,' may
       Perhaps be weigh'd hereafter, if not now;
     But whether such things do or do not weigh,
       All who have loved, or love, will still allow
     Life has nought like it. God is love, they say,
       And Love 's a god, or was before the brow
     Of earth was wrinkled by the sins and tears
     Of--but Chronology best knows the years.

     We left our hero and third heroine in
       A kind of state more awkward than uncommon,
     For gentlemen must sometimes risk their skin
       For that sad tempter, a forbidden woman:
     Sultans too much abhor this sort of sin,
       And don't agree at all with the wise Roman,
     Heroic, stoic Cato, the sententious,
     Who lent his lady to his friend Hortensius.

     I know Gulbeyaz was extremely wrong;
       I own it, I deplore it, I condemn it;
     But I detest all fiction even in song,
       And so must tell the truth, howe'er you blame it.
     Her reason being weak, her passions strong,
       She thought that her lord's heart (even could she claim it)
     Was scarce enough; for he had fifty-nine
     Years, and a fifteen-hundredth concubine.

     I am not, like Cassio, 'an arithmetician,'
       But by 'the bookish theoric' it appears,
     If 'tis summ'd up with feminine precision,
       That, adding to the account his Highness' years,
     The fair Sultana err'd from inanition;
       For, were the Sultan just to all his dears,
     She could but claim the fifteen-hundredth part
     Of what should be monopoly--the heart.

     It is observed that ladies are litigious
       Upon all legal objects of possession,
     And not the least so when they are religious,
       Which doubles what they think of the transgression:
     With suits and prosecutions they besiege us,
       As the tribunals show through many a session,
     When they suspect that any one goes shares
     In that to which the law makes them sole heirs.

     Now, if this holds good in a Christian land,
       The heathen also, though with lesser latitude,
     Are apt to carry things with a high hand,
       And take what kings call 'an imposing attitude,'
     And for their rights connubial make a stand,
       When their liege husbands treat them with ingratitude:
     And as four wives must have quadruple claims,
     The Tigris hath its jealousies like Thames.

     Gulbeyaz was the fourth, and (as I said)
       The favourite; but what 's favour amongst four?
     Polygamy may well be held in dread,
       Not only as a sin, but as a bore:
     Most wise men, with one moderate woman wed,
       Will scarcely find philosophy for more;
     And all (except Mahometans) forbear
     To make the nuptial couch a 'Bed of Ware.'

     His Highness, the sublimest of mankind,--
       So styled according to the usual forms
     Of every monarch, till they are consign'd
       To those sad hungry jacobins the worms,
     Who on the very loftiest kings have dined,--
       His Highness gazed upon Gulbeyaz' charms,
     Expecting all the welcome of a lover
     (A 'Highland welcome' all the wide world over).

     Now here we should distinguish; for howe'er
       Kisses, sweet words, embraces, and all that,
     May look like what is--neither here nor there,
       They are put on as easily as a hat,
     Or rather bonnet, which the fair sex wear,
       Trimm'd either heads or hearts to decorate,
     Which form an ornament, but no more part
     Of heads, than their caresses of the heart.

     A slight blush, a soft tremor, a calm kind
       Of gentle feminine delight, and shown
     More in the eyelids than the eyes, resign'd
       Rather to hide what pleases most unknown,
     Are the best tokens (to a modest mind)
       Of love, when seated on his loveliest throne,
     A sincere woman's breast,--for over-warm
     Or over-cold annihilates the charm.

     For over-warmth, if false, is worse than truth;
       If true, 'tis no great lease of its own fire;
     For no one, save in very early youth,
       Would like (I think) to trust all to desire,
     Which is but a precarious bond, in sooth,
       And apt to be transferr'd to the first buyer
     At a sad discount: while your over chilly
     Women, on t' other hand, seem somewhat silly.

     That is, we cannot pardon their bad taste,
       For so it seems to lovers swift or slow,
     Who fain would have a mutual flame confess'd,
       And see a sentimental passion glow,
     Even were St. Francis' paramour their guest,
       In his monastic concubine of snow;--
     In short, the maxim for the amorous tribe is
     Horatian, 'Medio tu tutissimus ibis.'

     The 'tu' 's too much,--but let it stand,--the verse
       Requires it, that 's to say, the English rhyme,
     And not the pink of old hexameters;
       But, after all, there 's neither tune nor time
     In the last line, which cannot well be worse,
       And was thrust in to close the octave's chime:
     I own no prosody can ever rate it
     As a rule, but truth may, if you translate it.

     If fair Gulbeyaz overdid her part,
       I know not--it succeeded, and success
     Is much in most things, not less in the heart
       Than other articles of female dress.
     Self-love in man, too, beats all female art;
       They lie, we lie, all lie, but love no less;
     And no one virtue yet, except starvation,
     Could stop that worst of vices--propagation.

     We leave this royal couple to repose:
       A bed is not a throne, and they may sleep,
     Whate'er their dreams be, if of joys or woes:
       Yet disappointed joys are woes as deep
     As any man's day mixture undergoes.
       Our least of sorrows are such as we weep;
     'Tis the vile daily drop on drop which wears
     The soul out (like the stone) with petty cares.

     A scolding wife, a sullen son, a bill
       To pay, unpaid, protested, or discounted
     At a per-centage; a child cross, dog ill,
       A favourite horse fallen lame just as he 's mounted,
     A bad old woman making a worse will,
       Which leaves you minus of the cash you counted
     As certain;--these are paltry things, and yet
     I 've rarely seen the man they did not fret.

     I 'm a philosopher; confound them all!
       Bills, beasts, and men, and--no! not womankind!
     With one good hearty curse I vent my gall,
       And then my stoicism leaves nought behind
     Which it can either pain or evil call,
       And I can give my whole soul up to mind;
     Though what is soul or mind, their birth or growth,
     Is more than I know--the deuce take them both!

       As after reading Athanasius' curse,
     Which doth your true believer so much please:
       I doubt if any now could make it worse
     O'er his worst enemy when at his knees,
       'Tis so sententious, positive, and terse,
     And decorates the book of Common Prayer,
     As doth a rainbow the just clearing air.

     Gulbeyaz and her lord were sleeping, or
       At least one of them!--Oh, the heavy night,
     When wicked wives, who love some bachelor,
       Lie down in dudgeon to sigh for the light
     Of the gray morning, and look vainly for
       Its twinkle through the lattice dusky quite--
     To toss, to tumble, doze, revive, and quake
     Lest their too lawful bed-fellow should wake!

     These are beneath the canopy of heaven,
       Also beneath the canopy of beds
     Four-posted and silk curtain'd, which are given
       For rich men and their brides to lay their heads
     Upon, in sheets white as what bards call 'driven
       Snow.' Well! 'tis all hap-hazard when one weds.
     Gulbeyaz was an empress, but had been
     Perhaps as wretched if a peasant's quean.

     Don Juan in his feminine disguise,
       With all the damsels in their long array,
     Had bow'd themselves before th' imperial eyes,
       And at the usual signal ta'en their way
     Back to their chambers, those long galleries
       In the seraglio, where the ladies lay
     Their delicate limbs; a thousand bosoms there
     Beating for love, as the caged bird's for air.

     I love the sex, and sometimes would reverse
       The tyrant's wish, 'that mankind only had
     One neck, which he with one fell stroke might pierce:'
       My wish is quite as wide, but not so bad,
     And much more tender on the whole than fierce;
       It being (not now, but only while a lad)
     That womankind had but one rosy mouth,
     To kiss them all at once from North to South.

     O, enviable Briareus! with thy hands
       And heads, if thou hadst all things multiplied
     In such proportion!--But my Muse withstands
       The giant thought of being a Titan's bride,
     Or travelling in Patagonian lands;
       So let us back to Lilliput, and guide
     Our hero through the labyrinth of love
     In which we left him several lines above.

     He went forth with the lovely Odalisques,
       At the given signal join'd to their array;
     And though he certainly ran many risks,
       Yet he could not at times keep, by the way
     (Although the consequences of such frisks
       Are worse than the worst damages men pay
     In moral England, where the thing 's a tax),
     From ogling all their charms from breasts to backs.

     Still he forgot not his disguise:--along
       The galleries from room to room they walk'd,
     A virgin-like and edifying throng,
       By eunuchs flank'd; while at their head there stalk'd
     A dame who kept up discipline among
       The female ranks, so that none stirr'd or talk'd
     Without her sanction on their she-parades:
     Her title was 'the Mother of the Maids.'

     Whether she was a 'mother,' I know not,
       Or whether they were 'maids' who call'd her mother;
     But this is her seraglio title, got
       I know not how, but good as any other;
     So Cantemir can tell you, or De Tott:
       Her office was to keep aloof or smother
     All bad propensities in fifteen hundred
     Young women, and correct them when they blunder'd.

     A goodly sinecure, no doubt! but made
       More easy by the absence of all men--
     Except his majesty, who, with her aid,
       And guards, and bolts, and walls, and now and then
     A slight example, just to cast a shade
       Along the rest, contrived to keep this den
     Of beauties cool as an Italian convent,
     Where all the passions have, alas! but one vent.

     And what is that? Devotion, doubtless--how
       Could you ask such a question?--but we will
     Continue. As I said, this goodly row
       Of ladies of all countries at the will
     Of one good man, with stately march and slow,
       Like water-lilies floating down a rill--
     Or rather lake, for rills do not run slowly--
     Paced on most maiden-like and melancholy.

     But when they reach'd their own apartments, there,
       Like birds, or boys, or bedlamites broke loose,
     Waves at spring-tide, or women anywhere
       When freed from bonds (which are of no great use
     After all), or like Irish at a fair,
       Their guards being gone, and as it were a truce
     Establish'd between them and bondage, they
     Began to sing, dance, chatter, smile, and play.

     Their talk, of course, ran most on the new comer;
       Her shape, her hair, her air, her everything:
     Some thought her dress did not so much become her,
       Or wonder'd at her ears without a ring;
     Some said her years were getting nigh their summer,
       Others contended they were but in spring;
     Some thought her rather masculine in height,
     While others wish'd that she had been so quite.

     But no one doubted on the whole, that she
       Was what her dress bespoke, a damsel fair,
     And fresh, and 'beautiful exceedingly,'
       Who with the brightest Georgians might compare:
     They wonder'd how Gulbeyaz, too, could be
       So silly as to buy slaves who might share
     (If that his Highness wearied of his bride)
     Her throne and power, and every thing beside.

     But what was strangest in this virgin crew,
       Although her beauty was enough to vex,
     After the first investigating view,
       They all found out as few, or fewer, specks
     In the fair form of their companion new,
       Than is the custom of the gentle sex,
     When they survey, with Christian eyes or Heathen,
     In a new face 'the ugliest creature breathing.'

     And yet they had their little jealousies,
       Like all the rest; but upon this occasion,
     Whether there are such things as sympathies
       Without our knowledge or our approbation,
     Although they could not see through his disguise,
       All felt a soft kind of concatenation,
     Like magnetism, or devilism, or what
     You please--we will not quarrel about that:

     But certain 'tis they all felt for their new
       Companion something newer still, as 'twere
     A sentimental friendship through and through,
       Extremely pure, which made them all concur
     In wishing her their sister, save a few
       Who wish'd they had a brother just like her,
     Whom, if they were at home in sweet Circassia,
     They would prefer to Padisha or Pacha.

     Of those who had most genius for this sort
       Of sentimental friendship, there were three,
     Lolah, Katinka, and Dudu; in short
       (To save description), fair as fair can be
     Were they, according to the best report,
       Though differing in stature and degree,
     And clime and time, and country and complexion;
     They all alike admired their new connection.

     Lolah was dusk as India and as warm;
       Katinka was a Georgian, white and red,
     With great blue eyes, a lovely hand and arm,
       And feet so small they scarce seem'd made to tread,
     But rather skim the earth; while Dudu's form
       Look'd more adapted to be put to bed,
     Being somewhat large, and languishing, and lazy,
     Yet of a beauty that would drive you crazy.

     A kind of sleepy Venus seem'd Dudu,
       Yet very fit to 'murder sleep' in those
     Who gazed upon her cheek's transcendent hue,
       Her Attic forehead, and her Phidian nose:
     Few angles were there in her form, 'tis true,
       Thinner she might have been, and yet scarce lose;
     Yet, after all, 'twould puzzle to say where
     It would not spoil some separate charm to pare.

     She was not violently lively, but
       Stole on your spirit like a May-day breaking;
     Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet, half-shut,
       They put beholders in a tender taking;
     She look'd (this simile 's quite new) just cut
       From marble, like Pygmalion's statue waking,
     The mortal and the marble still at strife,
     And timidly expanding into life.

     Lolah demanded the new damsel's name--
       'Juanna.'--Well, a pretty name enough.
     Katinka ask'd her also whence she came--
       'From Spain.'--'But where is Spain?'--'Don't ask such stuff,
     Nor show your Georgian ignorance--for shame!'
       Said Lolah, with an accent rather rough,
     To poor Katinka: 'Spain 's an island near
     Morocco, betwixt Egypt and Tangier.'

     Dudu said nothing, but sat down beside
       Juanna, playing with her veil or hair;
     And looking at her steadfastly, she sigh'd,
       As if she pitied her for being there,
     A pretty stranger without friend or guide,
       And all abash'd, too, at the general stare
     Which welcomes hapless strangers in all places,
     With kind remarks upon their mien and faces.

     But here the Mother of the Maids drew near,
       With, 'Ladies, it is time to go to rest.
     I 'm puzzled what to do with you, my dear,'
       She added to Juanna, their new guest:
     'Your coming has been unexpected here,
       And every couch is occupied; you had best
     Partake of mine; but by to-morrow early
     We will have all things settled for you fairly.'

     Here Lolah interposed--'Mamma, you know
       You don't sleep soundly, and I cannot bear
     That anybody should disturb you so;
       I 'll take Juanna; we 're a slenderer pair
     Than you would make the half of;--don't say no;
       And I of your young charge will take due care.'
     But here Katinka interfered, and said,
     'She also had compassion and a bed.

     'Besides, I hate to sleep alone,' quoth she.
       The matron frown'd: 'Why so?'--'For fear of ghosts,'
     Replied Katinka; 'I am sure I see
       A phantom upon each of the four posts;
     And then I have the worst dreams that can be,
       Of Guebres, Giaours, and Ginns, and Gouls in hosts.'
     The dame replied, 'Between your dreams and you,
     I fear Juanna's dreams would be but few.

     'You, Lolah, must continue still to lie
       Alone, for reasons which don't matter; you
     The same, Katinka, until by and by;
       And I shall place Juanna with Dudu,
     Who 's quiet, inoffensive, silent, shy,
       And will not toss and chatter the night through.
     What say you, child?'--Dudu said nothing, as
     Her talents were of the more silent class;

     But she rose up, and kiss'd the matron's brow
       Between the eyes, and Lolah on both cheeks,
     Katinka, too; and with a gentle bow
       (Curt'sies are neither used by Turks nor Greeks)
     She took Juanna by the hand to show
       Their place of rest, and left to both their piques,
     The others pouting at the matron's preference
     Of Dudu, though they held their tongues from deference.

     It was a spacious chamber (Oda is
       The Turkish title), and ranged round the wall
     Were couches, toilets--and much more than this
       I might describe, as I have seen it all,
     But it suffices--little was amiss;
       'Twas on the whole a nobly furnish'd hall,
     With all things ladies want, save one or two,
     And even those were nearer than they knew.

     Dudu, as has been said, was a sweet creature,
       Not very dashing, but extremely winning,
     With the most regulated charms of feature,
       Which painters cannot catch like faces sinning
     Against proportion--the wild strokes of nature
       Which they hit off at once in the beginning,
     Full of expression, right or wrong, that strike,
     And pleasing or unpleasing, still are like.

     But she was a soft landscape of mild earth,
       Where all was harmony, and calm, and quiet,
     Luxuriant, budding; cheerful without mirth,
       Which, if not happiness, is much more nigh it
     Than are your mighty passions and so forth,
       Which some call 'the sublime:' I wish they 'd try it:
     I 've seen your stormy seas and stormy women,
     And pity lovers rather more than seamen.

     But she was pensive more than melancholy,
       And serious more than pensive, and serene,
     It may be, more than either--not unholy
       Her thoughts, at least till now, appear to have been.
     The strangest thing was, beauteous, she was wholly
       Unconscious, albeit turn'd of quick seventeen,
     That she was fair, or dark, or short, or tall;
     She never thought about herself at all.

     And therefore was she kind and gentle as
       The Age of Gold (when gold was yet unknown,
     By which its nomenclature came to pass;
       Thus most appropriately has been shown
     'Lucus a non lucendo,' not what was,
       But what was not; a sort of style that 's grown
     Extremely common in this age, whose metal
     The devil may decompose, but never settle:

     I think it may be of 'Corinthian Brass,'
       Which was a mixture of all metals, but
     The brazen uppermost). Kind reader! pass
       This long parenthesis: I could not shut
     It sooner for the soul of me, and class
       My faults even with your own! which meaneth, Put
     A kind construction upon them and me:
     But that you won't--then don't--I am not less free.

     'Tis time we should return to plain narration,
       And thus my narrative proceeds:--Dudu,
     With every kindness short of ostentation,
       Show'd Juan, or Juanna, through and through
     This labyrinth of females, and each station
       Described--what 's strange--in words extremely few:
     I have but one simile, and that 's a blunder,
     For wordless woman, which is silent thunder.

     And next she gave her (I say her, because
       The gender still was epicene, at least
     In outward show, which is a saving clause)
       An outline of the customs of the East,
     With all their chaste integrity of laws,
       By which the more a haram is increased,
     The stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties
     Of any supernumerary beauties.

     And then she gave Juanna a chaste kiss:
       Dudu was fond of kissing--which I 'm sure
     That nobody can ever take amiss,
       Because 'tis pleasant, so that it be pure,
     And between females means no more than this--
       That they have nothing better near, or newer.
     'Kiss' rhymes to 'bliss' in fact as well as verse--
     I wish it never led to something worse.

     In perfect innocence she then unmade
       Her toilet, which cost little, for she was
     A child of Nature, carelessly array'd:
       If fond of a chance ogle at her glass,
     'Twas like the fawn, which, in the lake display'd,
       Beholds her own shy, shadowy image pass,
     When first she starts, and then returns to peep,
     Admiring this new native of the deep.

     And one by one her articles of dress
       Were laid aside; but not before she offer'd
     Her aid to fair Juanna, whose excess
       Of modesty declined the assistance proffer'd:
     Which pass'd well off--as she could do no less;
       Though by this politesse she rather suffer'd,
     Pricking her fingers with those cursed pins,
     Which surely were invented for our sins,--

     Making a woman like a porcupine,
       Not to be rashly touch'd. But still more dread,
     O ye! whose fate it is, as once 'twas mine,
       In early youth, to turn a lady's maid;--
     I did my very boyish best to shine
       In tricking her out for a masquerade;
     The pins were placed sufficiently, but not
     Stuck all exactly in the proper spot.

     But these are foolish things to all the wise,
       And I love wisdom more than she loves me;
     My tendency is to philosophise
       On most things, from a tyrant to a tree;
     But still the spouseless virgin Knowledge flies.
       What are we? and whence came we? what shall be
     Our ultimate existence? what 's our present?
     Are questions answerless, and yet incessant.

     There was deep silence in the chamber: dim
       And distant from each other burn'd the lights,
     And slumber hover'd o'er each lovely limb
       Of the fair occupants: if there be sprites,
     They should have walk'd there in their sprightliest trim,
       By way of change from their sepulchral sites,
     And shown themselves as ghosts of better taste
     Than haunting some old ruin or wild waste.

     Many and beautiful lay those around,
       Like flowers of different hue, and dime, and root,
     In some exotic garden sometimes found,
       With cost, and care, and warmth induced to shoot.
     One with her auburn tresses lightly bound,
       And fair brows gently drooping, as the fruit
     Nods from the tree, was slumbering with soft breath,
     And lips apart, which show'd the pearls beneath.

     One with her flush'd cheek laid on her white arm,
       And raven ringlets gather'd in dark crowd
     Above her brow, lay dreaming soft and warm;
       And smiling through her dream, as through a cloud
     The moon breaks, half unveil'd each further charm,
       As, slightly stirring in her snowy shroud,
     Her beauties seized the unconscious hour of night
     All bashfully to struggle into light.

     This is no bull, although it sounds so; for
       'Twas night, but there were lamps, as hath been said.
     A third's all pallid aspect offer'd more
       The traits of sleeping sorrow, and betray'd
     Through the heaved breast the dream of some far shore
       Beloved and deplored; while slowly stray'd
     (As night-dew, on a cypress glittering, tinges
     The black bough) tear-drops through her eyes' dark fringes.

     A fourth as marble, statue-like and still,
       Lay in a breathless, hush'd, and stony sleep;
     White, cold, and pure, as looks a frozen rill,
       Or the snow minaret on an Alpine steep,
     Or Lot's wife done in salt,--or what you will;--
       My similes are gather'd in a heap,
     So pick and choose--perhaps you 'll be content
     With a carved lady on a monument.

     And lo! a fifth appears;--and what is she?
       A lady of a 'certain age,' which means
     Certainly aged--what her years might be
       I know not, never counting past their teens;
     But there she slept, not quite so fair to see,
       As ere that awful period intervenes
     Which lays both men and women on the shelf,
     To meditate upon their sins and self.

     But all this time how slept, or dream'd, Dudu?
       With strict inquiry I could ne'er discover,
     And scorn to add a syllable untrue;
       But ere the middle watch was hardly over,
     Just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue,
       And phantoms hover'd, or might seem to hover,
     To those who like their company, about
     The apartment, on a sudden she scream'd out:

     And that so loudly, that upstarted all
       The Oda, in a general commotion:
     Matron and maids, and those whom you may call
       Neither, came crowding like the waves of ocean,
     One on the other, throughout the whole hall,
       All trembling, wondering, without the least notion
     More than I have myself of what could make
     The calm Dudu so turbulently wake.

     But wide awake she was, and round her bed,
       With floating draperies and with flying hair,
     With eager eyes, and light but hurried tread,
       And bosoms, arms, and ankles glancing bare,
     And bright as any meteor ever bred
       By the North Pole,--they sought her cause of care,
     For she seem'd agitated, flush'd, and frighten'd,
     Her eye dilated and her colour heighten'd.

     But what was strange--and a strong proof how great
       A blessing is sound sleep--Juanna lay
     As fast as ever husband by his mate
       In holy matrimony snores away.
     Not all the clamour broke her happy state
       Of slumber, ere they shook her,--so they say
     At least,--and then she, too, unclosed her eyes,
     And yawn'd a good deal with discreet surprise.

     And now commenced a strict investigation,
       Which, as all spoke at once and more than once,
     Conjecturing, wondering, asking a narration,
       Alike might puzzle either wit or dunce
     To answer in a very clear oration.
       Dudu had never pass'd for wanting sense,
     But, being 'no orator as Brutus is,'
     Could not at first expound what was amiss.

     At length she said, that in a slumber sound
       She dream'd a dream, of walking in a wood--
     A 'wood obscure,' like that where Dante found
       Himself in at the age when all grow good;
     Life's half-way house, where dames with virtue crown'd
       Run much less risk of lovers turning rude;
     And that this wood was full of pleasant fruits,
     And trees of goodly growth and spreading roots;

     And in the midst a golden apple grew,--
       A most prodigious pippin,--but it hung
     Rather too high and distant; that she threw
       Her glances on it, and then, longing, flung
     Stones and whatever she could pick up, to
       Bring down the fruit, which still perversely clung
     To its own bough, and dangled yet in sight,
     But always at a most provoking height;--

     That on a sudden, when she least had hope,
       It fell down of its own accord before
     Her feet; that her first movement was to stoop
       And pick it up, and bite it to the core;
     That just as her young lip began to ope
       Upon the golden fruit the vision bore,
     A bee flew out and stung her to the heart,
     And so--she awoke with a great scream and start.

     All this she told with some confusion and
       Dismay, the usual consequence of dreams
     Of the unpleasant kind, with none at hand
       To expound their vain and visionary gleams.
     I 've known some odd ones which seem'd really plann'd
       Prophetically, or that which one deems
     A 'strange coincidence,' to use a phrase
     By which such things are settled now-a-days.

     The damsels, who had thoughts of some great harm,
       Began, as is the consequence of fear,
     To scold a little at the false alarm
       That broke for nothing on their sleeping car.
     The matron, too, was wroth to leave her warm
       Bed for the dream she had been obliged to hear,
     And chafed at poor Dudu, who only sigh'd,
     And said that she was sorry she had cried.

     'I 've heard of stories of a cock and bull;
       But visions of an apple and a bee,
     To take us from our natural rest, and pull
       The whole Oda from their beds at half-past three,
     Would make us think the moon is at its full.
       You surely are unwell, child! we must see,
     To-morrow, what his Highness's physician
     Will say to this hysteric of a vision.

     'And poor Juanna, too--the child's first night
       Within these walls to be broke in upon
     With such a clamour! I had thought it right
       That the young stranger should not lie alone,
     And, as the quietest of all, she might
       With you, Dudu, a good night's rest have known;
     But now I must transfer her to the charge
     Of Lolah--though her couch is not so large.'

     Lolah's eyes sparkled at the proposition;
       But poor Dudu, with large drops in her own,
     Resulting from the scolding or the vision,
       Implored that present pardon might be shown
     For this first fault, and that on no condition
       (She added in a soft and piteous tone)
     Juanna should be taken from her, and
     Her future dreams should all be kept in hand.

     She promised never more to have a dream,
       At least to dream so loudly as just now;
     She wonder'd at herself how she could scream--
       'Twas foolish, nervous, as she must allow,
     A fond hallucination, and a theme
       For laughter--but she felt her spirits low,
     And begg'd they would excuse her; she 'd get over
     This weakness in a few hours, and recover.

     And here Juanna kindly interposed,
       And said she felt herself extremely well
     Where she then was, as her sound sleep disclosed
       When all around rang like a tocsin bell:
     She did not find herself the least disposed
       To quit her gentle partner, and to dwell
     Apart from one who had no sin to show,
     Save that of dreaming once 'mal-a-propos.'

     As thus Juanna spoke, Dudu turn'd round
       And hid her face within Juanna's breast:
     Her neck alone was seen, but that was found
       The colour of a budding rose's crest.
     I can't tell why she blush'd, nor can expound
       The mystery of this rupture of their rest;
     All that I know is, that the facts I state
     Are true as truth has ever been of late.

     And so good night to them,--or, if you will,
       Good morrow--for the cock had crown, and light
     Began to clothe each Asiatic hill,
       And the mosque crescent struggled into sight
     Of the long caravan, which in the chill
       Of dewy dawn wound slowly round each height
     That stretches to the stony belt, which girds
     Asia, where Kaff looks down upon the Kurds.

     With the first ray, or rather grey of morn,
       Gulbeyaz rose from restlessness; and pale
     As passion rises, with its bosom worn,
       Array'd herself with mantle, gem, and veil.
     The nightingale that sings with the deep thorn,
       Which fable places in her breast of wail,
     Is lighter far of heart and voice than those
     Whose headlong passions form their proper woes.

     And that 's the moral of this composition,
       If people would but see its real drift;--
     But that they will not do without suspicion,
       Because all gentle readers have the gift
     Of closing 'gainst the light their orbs of vision;
       While gentle writers also love to lift
     Their voices 'gainst each other, which is natural,
     The numbers are too great for them to flatter all.

     Rose the sultana from a bed of splendour,
       Softer than the soft Sybarite's, who cried
     Aloud because his feelings were too tender
       To brook a ruffled rose-leaf by his side,--
     So beautiful that art could little mend her,
       Though pale with conflicts between love and pride;--
     So agitated was she with her error,
     She did not even look into the mirror.

     Also arose about the self-same time,
       Perhaps a little later, her great lord,
     Master of thirty kingdoms so sublime,
       And of a wife by whom he was abhorr'd;
     A thing of much less import in that clime--
       At least to those of incomes which afford
     The filling up their whole connubial cargo--
     Than where two wives are under an embargo.

     He did not think much on the matter, nor
       Indeed on any other: as a man
     He liked to have a handsome paramour
       At hand, as one may like to have a fan,
     And therefore of Circassians had good store,
       As an amusement after the Divan;
     Though an unusual fit of love, or duty,
     Had made him lately bask in his bride's beauty.

     And now he rose; and after due ablutions
       Exacted by the customs of the East,
     And prayers and other pious evolutions,
       He drank six cups of coffee at the least,
     And then withdrew to hear about the Russians,
       Whose victories had recently increased
     In Catherine's reign, whom glory still adores,

     But oh, thou grand legitimate Alexander!
       Her son's son, let not this last phrase offend
     Thine ear, if it should reach--and now rhymes wander
       Almost as far as Petersburgh and lend
     A dreadful impulse to each loud meander
       Of murmuring Liberty's wide waves, which blend
     Their roar even with the Baltic's--so you be
     Your father's son, 'tis quite enough for me.

     To call men love-begotten or proclaim
       Their mothers as the antipodes of Timon,
     That hater of mankind, would be a shame,
       A libel, or whate'er you please to rhyme on:
     But people's ancestors are history's game;
       And if one lady's slip could leave a crime on
     All generations, I should like to know
     What pedigree the best would have to show?

     Had Catherine and the sultan understood
       Their own true interests, which kings rarely know
     Until 'tis taught by lessons rather rude,
       There was a way to end their strife, although
     Perhaps precarious, had they but thought good,
       Without the aid of prince or plenipo:
     She to dismiss her guards and he his haram,
     And for their other matters, meet and share 'em.

     But as it was, his Highness had to hold
       His daily council upon ways and means
     How to encounter with this martial scold,
       This modern Amazon and queen of queans;
     And the perplexity could not be told
       Of all the pillars of the state, which leans
     Sometimes a little heavy on the backs
     Of those who cannot lay on a new tax.

     Meantime Gulbeyaz, when her king was gone,
       Retired into her boudoir, a sweet place
     For love or breakfast; private, pleasing, lone,
       And rich with all contrivances which grace
     Those gay recesses:--many a precious stone
       Sparkled along its roof, and many a vase
     Of porcelain held in the fetter'd flowers,
     Those captive soothers of a captive's hours.

     Mother of pearl, and porphyry, and marble,
       Vied with each other on this costly spot;
     And singing birds without were heard to warble;
       And the stain'd glass which lighted this fair grot
     Varied each ray;--but all descriptions garble
       The true effect, and so we had better not
     Be too minute; an outline is the best,--
     A lively reader's fancy does the rest.

     And here she summon'd Baba, and required
       Don Juan at his hands, and information
     Of what had pass'd since all the slaves retired,
       And whether he had occupied their station;
     If matters had been managed as desired,
       And his disguise with due consideration
     Kept up; and above all, the where and how
     He had pass'd the night, was what she wish'd to know.

     Baba, with some embarrassment, replied
       To this long catechism of questions, ask'd
     More easily than answer'd,--that he had tried
       His best to obey in what he had been task'd;
     But there seem'd something that he wish'd to hide,
       Which hesitation more betray'd than mask'd;
     He scratch'd his ear, the infallible resource
     To which embarrass'd people have recourse.

     Gulbeyaz was no model of true patience,
       Nor much disposed to wait in word or deed;
     She liked quick answers in all conversations;
       And when she saw him stumbling like a steed
     In his replies, she puzzled him for fresh ones;
       And as his speech grew still more broken-kneed,
     Her cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,
     And her proud brow's blue veins to swell and darkle.

     When Baba saw these symptoms, which he knew
       To bode him no great good, he deprecated
     Her anger, and beseech'd she 'd hear him through--
       He could not help the thing which he related:
     Then out it came at length, that to Dudu
       Juan was given in charge, as hath been stated;
     But not by Baba's fault, he said, and swore on
     The holy camel's hump, besides the Koran.

     The chief dame of the Oda, upon whom
       The discipline of the whole haram bore,
     As soon as they re-enter'd their own room,
       For Baba's function stopt short at the door,
     Had settled all; nor could he then presume
       (The aforesaid Baba) just then to do more,
     Without exciting such suspicion as
     Might make the matter still worse than it was.

     He hoped, indeed he thought, he could be sure
       Juan had not betray'd himself; in fact
     'Twas certain that his conduct had been pure,
       Because a foolish or imprudent act
     Would not alone have made him insecure,
       But ended in his being found out and sack'd,
     And thrown into the sea.--Thus Baba spoke
     Of all save Dudu's dream, which was no joke.

     This he discreetly kept in the background,
       And talk'd away--and might have talk'd till now,
     For any further answer that he found,
       So deep an anguish wrung Gulbeyaz' brow:
     Her cheek turn'd ashes, ears rung, brain whirl'd round,
       As if she had received a sudden blow,
     And the heart's dew of pain sprang fast and chilly
     O'er her fair front, like Morning's on a lily.

     Although she was not of the fainting sort,
       Baba thought she would faint, but there he err'd--
     It was but a convulsion, which though short
       Can never be described; we all have heard,
     And some of us have felt thus 'all amort,'
       When things beyond the common have occurr'd;--
     Gulbeyaz proved in that brief agony
     What she could ne'er express--then how should I?

     She stood a moment as a Pythones
       Stands on her tripod, agonised, and full
     Of inspiration gather'd from distress,
       When all the heart-strings like wild horses pull
     The heart asunder;--then, as more or lees
       Their speed abated or their strength grew dull,
     She sunk down on her seat by slow degrees,
     And bow'd her throbbing head o'er trembling knees.

     Her face declined and was unseen; her hair
       Fell in long tresses like the weeping willow,
     Sweeping the marble underneath her chair,
       Or rather sofa (for it was all pillow,
     A low soft ottoman), and black despair
       Stirr'd up and down her bosom like a billow,
     Which rushes to some shore whose shingles check
