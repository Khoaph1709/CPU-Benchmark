     Its farther course, but must receive its wreck.

     Her head hung down, and her long hair in stooping
       Conceal'd her features better than a veil;
     And one hand o'er the ottoman lay drooping,
       White, waxen, and as alabaster pale:
     Would that I were a painter! to be grouping
       All that a poet drags into detail
     O that my words were colours! but their tints
     May serve perhaps as outlines or slight hints.

     Baba, who knew by experience when to talk
       And when to hold his tongue, now held it till
     This passion might blow o'er, nor dared to balk
       Gulbeyaz' taciturn or speaking will.
     At length she rose up, and began to walk
       Slowly along the room, but silent still,
     And her brow clear'd, but not her troubled eye;
     The wind was down, but still the sea ran high.

     She stopp'd, and raised her head to speak--but paused,
       And then moved on again with rapid pace;
     Then slacken'd it, which is the march most caused
       By deep emotion:--you may sometimes trace
     A feeling in each footstep, as disclosed
       By Sallust in his Catiline, who, chased
     By all the demons of all passions, show'd
     Their work even by the way in which he trode.

     Gulbeyaz stopp'd and beckon'd Baba:--'Slave!
       Bring the two slaves!' she said in a low tone,
     But one which Baba did not like to brave,
       And yet he shudder'd, and seem'd rather prone
     To prove reluctant, and begg'd leave to crave
       (Though he well knew the meaning) to be shown
     What slaves her highness wish'd to indicate,
     For fear of any error, like the late.

     'The Georgian and her paramour,' replied
       The imperial bride--and added, 'Let the boat
     Be ready by the secret portal's side:
       You know the rest.' The words stuck in her throat,
     Despite her injured love and fiery pride;
       And of this Baba willingly took note,
     And begg'd by every hair of Mahomet's beard,
     She would revoke the order he had heard.

     'To hear is to obey,' he said; 'but still,
       Sultana, think upon the consequence:
     It is not that I shall not all fulfil
       Your orders, even in their severest sense;
     But such precipitation may end ill,
       Even at your own imperative expense:
     I do not mean destruction and exposure,
     In case of any premature disclosure;

     'But your own feelings. Even should all the rest
       Be hidden by the rolling waves, which hide
     Already many a once love-beaten breast
       Deep in the caverns of the deadly tide--
     You love this boyish, new, seraglio guest,
       And if this violent remedy be tried--
     Excuse my freedom, when I here assure you,
     That killing him is not the way to cure you.'

     'What dost thou know of love or feeling?--Wretch!
       Begone!' she cried, with kindling eyes--'and do
     My bidding!' Baba vanish'd, for to stretch
       His own remonstrance further he well knew
     Might end in acting as his own 'Jack Ketch;'
       And though he wish'd extremely to get through
     This awkward business without harm to others,
     He still preferr'd his own neck to another's.

     Away he went then upon his commission,
       Growling and grumbling in good Turkish phrase
     Against all women of whate'er condition,
       Especially sultanas and their ways;
     Their obstinacy, pride, and indecision,
       Their never knowing their own mind two days,
     The trouble that they gave, their immorality,
     Which made him daily bless his own neutrality.

     And then he call'd his brethren to his aid,
       And sent one on a summons to the pair,
     That they must instantly be well array'd,
       And above all be comb'd even to a hair,
     And brought before the empress, who had made
       Inquiries after them with kindest care:
     At which Dudu look'd strange, and Juan silly;
     But go they must at once, and will I--nill I.

     And here I leave them at their preparation
       For the imperial presence, wherein whether
     Gulbeyaz show'd them both commiseration,
       Or got rid of the parties altogether,
     Like other angry ladies of her nation,--
       Are things the turning of a hair or feather
     May settle; but far be 't from me to anticipate
     In what way feminine caprice may dissipate.

     I leave them for the present with good wishes,
       Though doubts of their well doing, to arrange
     Another part of history; for the dishes
       Of this our banquet we must sometimes change;
     And trusting Juan may escape the fishes,
       Although his situation now seems strange
     And scarce secure, as such digressions are fair,
     The Muse will take a little touch at warfare.


[Illustration: Canto 7]




CANTO THE SEVENTH.

     O Love! O Glory! what are ye who fly
       Around us ever, rarely to alight?
     There 's not a meteor in the polar sky
       Of such transcendent and more fleeting flight.
     Chill, and chain'd to cold earth, we lift on high
       Our eyes in search of either lovely light;
     A thousand and a thousand colours they
     Assume, then leave us on our freezing way.

     And such as they are, such my present tale is,
       A non-descript and ever-varying rhyme,
     A versified Aurora Borealis,
       Which flashes o'er a waste and icy clime.
     When we know what all are, we must bewail us,
       But ne'ertheless I hope it is no crime
     To laugh at all things--for I wish to know
     What, after all, are all things--but a show?

     They accuse me--Me--the present writer of
       The present poem--of--I know not what--
     A tendency to under-rate and scoff
       At human power and virtue, and all that;
     And this they say in language rather rough.
       Good God! I wonder what they would be at!
     I say no more than hath been said in Dante's
     Verse, and by Solomon and by Cervantes;

     By Swift, by Machiavel, by Rochefoucault,
       By Fenelon, by Luther, and by Plato;
     By Tillotson, and Wesley, and Rousseau,
       Who knew this life was not worth a potato.
     'T is not their fault, nor mine, if this be so--
       For my part, I pretend not to be Cato,
     Nor even Diogenes.--We live and die,
     But which is best, you know no more than I.

     Socrates said, our only knowledge was
       'To know that nothing could be known;' a pleasant
     Science enough, which levels to an ass
       Each man of wisdom, future, past, or present.
     Newton (that proverb of the mind), alas!
       Declared, with all his grand discoveries recent,
     That he himself felt only 'like a youth
     Picking up shells by the great ocean--Truth.'

     Ecclesiastes said, 'that all is vanity'-
       Most modern preachers say the same, or show it
     By their examples of true Christianity:
       In short, all know, or very soon may know it;
     And in this scene of all-confess'd inanity,
       By saint, by sage, by preacher, and by poet,
     Must I restrain me, through the fear of strife,
     From holding up the nothingness of life?

     Dogs, or men!--for I flatter you in saying
       That ye are dogs--your betters far--ye may
     Read, or read not, what I am now essaying
       To show ye what ye are in every way.
     As little as the moon stops for the baying
       Of wolves, will the bright muse withdraw one ray
     From out her skies--then howl your idle wrath!
     While she still silvers o'er your gloomy path.

     'Fierce loves and faithless wars'--I am not sure
       If this be the right reading--'t is no matter;
     The fact 's about the same, I am secure;
       I sing them both, and am about to batter
     A town which did a famous siege endure,
       And was beleaguer'd both by land and water
     By Souvaroff, or Anglice Suwarrow,
     Who loved blood as an alderman loves marrow.

     The fortress is call'd Ismail, and is placed
       Upon the Danube's left branch and left bank,
     With buildings in the Oriental taste,
       But still a fortress of the foremost rank,
     Or was at least, unless 't is since defaced,
       Which with your conquerors is a common prank:
     It stands some eighty versts from the high sea,
     And measures round of toises thousands three.

     Within the extent of this fortification
       A borough is comprised along the height
     Upon the left, which from its loftier station
       Commands the city, and upon its site
     A Greek had raised around this elevation
       A quantity of palisades upright,
     So placed as to impede the fire of those
     Who held the place, and to assist the foe's.

     This circumstance may serve to give a notion
       Of the high talents of this new Vauban:
     But the town ditch below was deep as ocean,
       The rampart higher than you 'd wish to hang:
     But then there was a great want of precaution
       (Prithee, excuse this engineering slang),
     Nor work advanced, nor cover'd way was there,
     To hint at least 'Here is no thoroughfare.'

     But a stone bastion, with a narrow gorge,
       And walls as thick as most skulls born as yet;
     Two batteries, cap-a-pie, as our St. George,
       Case-mated one, and t' other 'a barbette,'
     Of Danube's bank took formidable charge;
       While two and twenty cannon duly set
     Rose over the town's right side, in bristling tier,
     Forty feet high, upon a cavalier.

     But from the river the town 's open quite,
       Because the Turks could never be persuaded
     A Russian vessel e'er would heave in sight;
       And such their creed was, till they were invaded,
     When it grew rather late to set things right.
       But as the Danube could not well be waded,
     They look'd upon the Muscovite flotilla,
     And only shouted, 'Allah!' and 'Bis Millah!'

     The Russians now were ready to attack:
       But oh, ye goddesses of war and glory!
     How shall I spell the name of each Cossacque
       Who were immortal, could one tell their story?
     Alas! what to their memory can lack?
       Achilles' self was not more grim and gory
     Than thousands of this new and polish'd nation,
     Whose names want nothing but--pronunciation.

     Still I 'll record a few, if but to increase
       Our euphony: there was Strongenoff, and Strokonoff,
     Meknop, Serge Lwow, Arsniew of modern Greece,
       And Tschitsshakoff, and Roguenoff, and Chokenoff,
     And others of twelve consonants apiece;
       And more might be found out, if I could poke enough
     Into gazettes; but Fame (capricious strumpet),
     It seems, has got an ear as well as trumpet,

     And cannot tune those discords of narration,
       Which may be names at Moscow, into rhyme;
     Yet there were several worth commemoration,
       As e'er was virgin of a nuptial chime;
     Soft words, too, fitted for the peroration
       Of Londonderry drawling against time,
     Ending in 'ischskin,' 'ousckin,' 'iffskchy,' 'ouski:
     Of whom we can insert but Rousamouski,

     Scherematoff and Chrematoff, Koklophti,
       Koclobski, Kourakin, and Mouskin Pouskin,
     All proper men of weapons, as e'er scoff'd high
       Against a foe, or ran a sabre through skin:
     Little cared they for Mahomet or Mufti,
       Unless to make their kettle-drums a new skin
     Out of their hides, if parchment had grown dear,
     And no more handy substitute been near.

     Then there were foreigners of much renown,
       Of various nations, and all volunteers;
     Not fighting for their country or its crown,
       But wishing to be one day brigadiers;
     Also to have the sacking of a town,--
       A pleasant thing to young men at their years.
     'Mongst them were several Englishmen of pith,
     Sixteen call'd Thomson, and nineteen named Smith.

     Jack Thomson and Bill Thomson; all the rest
       Had been call'd 'Jemmy,' after the great bard;
     I don't know whether they had arms or crest,
       But such a godfather 's as good a card.
     Three of the Smiths were Peters; but the best
       Amongst them all, hard blows to inflict or ward,
     Was he, since so renown'd 'in country quarters
     At Halifax;' but now he served the Tartars.

     The rest were jacks and Gills and Wills and Bills;
       But when I 've added that the elder jack Smith
     Was born in Cumberland among the hills,
       And that his father was an honest blacksmith,
     I 've said all I know of a name that fills
       Three lines of the despatch in taking 'Schmacksmith,'
     A village of Moldavia's waste, wherein
     He fell, immortal in a bulletin.

     I wonder (although Mars no doubt 's a god
       Praise) if a man's name in a bulletin
     May make up for a bullet in his body?
       I hope this little question is no sin,
     Because, though I am but a simple noddy,
       I think one Shakspeare puts the same thought in
     The mouth of some one in his plays so doting,
     Which many people pass for wits by quoting.

     Then there were Frenchmen, gallant, young, and gay:
       But I 'm too great a patriot to record
     Their Gallic names upon a glorious day;
       I 'd rather tell ten lies than say a word
     Of truth;--such truths are treason; they betray
       Their country; and as traitors are abhorr'd
     Who name the French in English, save to show
     How Peace should make John Bull the Frenchman's foe.

     The Russians, having built two batteries on
       An isle near Ismail, had two ends in view;
     The first was to bombard it, and knock down
       The public buildings and the private too,
     No matter what poor souls might be undone.
       The city's shape suggested this, 't is true;
     Form'd like an amphitheatre, each dwelling
     Presented a fine mark to throw a shell in.

     The second object was to profit by
       The moment of the general consternation,
     To attack the Turk's flotilla, which lay nigh
       Extremely tranquil, anchor'd at its station:
     But a third motive was as probably
       To frighten them into capitulation;
     A phantasy which sometimes seizes warriors,
     Unless they are game as bull-dogs and fox-terriers.

     A habit rather blamable, which is
       That of despising those we combat with,
     Common in many cases, was in this
       The cause of killing Tchitchitzkoff and Smith;
     One of the valorous 'Smiths' whom we shall miss
       Out of those nineteen who late rhymed to 'pith;'
     But 't is a name so spread o'er 'Sir' and 'Madam,'
     That one would think the first who bore it 'Adam.'

     The Russian batteries were incomplete,
       Because they were constructed in a hurry;
     Thus the same cause which makes a verse want feet,
       And throws a cloud o'er Longman and John Murray,
     When the sale of new books is not so fleet
       As they who print them think is necessary,
     May likewise put off for a time what story
     Sometimes calls 'murder,' and at others 'glory.'

     Whether it was their engineer's stupidity,
       Their haste, or waste, I neither know nor care,
     Or some contractor's personal cupidity,
       Saving his soul by cheating in the ware
     Of homicide, but there was no solidity
       In the new batteries erected there;
     They either miss'd, or they were never miss'd,
     And added greatly to the missing list.

     A sad miscalculation about distance
       Made all their naval matters incorrect;
     Three fireships lost their amiable existence
       Before they reach'd a spot to take effect:
     The match was lit too soon, and no assistance
       Could remedy this lubberly defect;
     They blew up in the middle of the river,
     While, though 't was dawn, the Turks slept fast as ever.

     At seven they rose, however, and survey'd
       The Russ flotilla getting under way;
     'T was nine, when still advancing undismay'd,
       Within a cable's length their vessels lay
     Off Ismail, and commenced a cannonade,
       Which was return'd with interest, I may say,
     And by a fire of musketry and grape,
     And shells and shot of every size and shape.

     For six hours bore they without intermission
       The Turkish fire, and aided by their own
     Land batteries, work'd their guns with great precision:
       At length they found mere cannonade alone
     By no means would produce the town's submission,
       And made a signal to retreat at one.
     One bark blew up, a second near the works
     Running aground, was taken by the Turks.

     The Moslem, too, had lost both ships and men;
       But when they saw the enemy retire,
     Their Delhis mann'd some boats, and sail'd again,
       And gall'd the Russians with a heavy fire,
     And tried to make a landing on the main;
       But here the effect fell short of their desire:
     Count Damas drove them back into the water
     Pell-mell, and with a whole gazette of slaughter.

     'If' (says the historian here) 'I could report
       All that the Russians did upon this day,
     I think that several volumes would fall short,
       And I should still have many things to say;'
     And so he says no more--but pays his court
       To some distinguish'd strangers in that fray;
     The Prince de Ligne, and Langeron, and Damas,
     Names great as any that the roll of Fame has.

     This being the case, may show us what Fame is:
       For out of these three 'preux Chevaliers,' how
     Many of common readers give a guess
       That such existed? (and they may live now
     For aught we know.) Renown 's all hit or miss;
       There 's fortune even in fame, we must allow.
     'T is true the Memoirs of the Prince de Ligne
     Have half withdrawn from him oblivion's screen.

     But here are men who fought in gallant actions
       As gallantly as ever heroes fought,
     But buried in the heap of such transactions
       Their names are rarely found, nor often sought.
     Thus even good fame may suffer sad contractions,
       And is extinguish'd sooner than she ought:
     Of all our modern battles, I will bet
     You can't repeat nine names from each Gazette.

     In short, this last attack, though rich in glory,
       Show'd that somewhere, somehow, there was a fault,
     And Admiral Ribas (known in Russian story)
       Most strongly recommended an assault;
     In which he was opposed by young and hoary,
       Which made a long debate; but I must halt,
     For if I wrote down every warrior's speech,
     I doubt few readers e'er would mount the breach.

     There was a man, if that he was a man,
       Not that his manhood could be call'd in question,
     For had he not been Hercules, his span
       Had been as short in youth as indigestion
     Made his last illness, when, all worn and wan,
       He died beneath a tree, as much unblest on
     The soil of the green province he had wasted,
     As e'er was locust on the land it blasted.

     This was Potemkin--a great thing in days
       When homicide and harlotry made great;
     If stars and titles could entail long praise,
       His glory might half equal his estate.
     This fellow, being six foot high, could raise
       A kind of phantasy proportionate
     In the then sovereign of the Russian people,
     Who measured men as you would do a steeple.

     While things were in abeyance, Ribas sent
       A courier to the prince, and he succeeded
     In ordering matters after his own bent;
       I cannot tell the way in which he pleaded,
     But shortly he had cause to be content.
       In the mean time, the batteries proceeded,
     And fourscore cannon on the Danube's border
     Were briskly fired and answer'd in due order.

     But on the thirteenth, when already part
       Of the troops were embark'd, the siege to raise,
     A courier on the spur inspired new heart
       Into all panters for newspaper praise,
     As well as dilettanti in war's art,
       By his despatches couch'd in pithy phrase;
     Announcing the appointment of that lover of
     Battles to the command, Field-Marshal Souvaroff.

     The letter of the prince to the same marshal
       Was worthy of a Spartan, had the cause
     Been one to which a good heart could be partial--
       Defence of freedom, country, or of laws;
     But as it was mere lust of power to o'er-arch all
       With its proud brow, it merits slight applause,
     Save for its style, which said, all in a trice,
     'You will take Ismail at whatever price.'

     'Let there be light! said God, and there was light!'
       'Let there be blood!' says man, and there 's a seal
     The fiat of this spoil'd child of the Night
       (For Day ne'er saw his merits) could decree
     More evil in an hour, than thirty bright
       Summers could renovate, though they should be
     Lovely as those which ripen'd Eden's fruit;
     For war cuts up not only branch, but root.

     Our friends the Turks, who with loud 'Allahs' now
       Began to signalise the Russ retreat,
     Were damnably mistaken; few are slow
       In thinking that their enemy is beat
     (Or beaten, if you insist on grammar, though
       I never think about it in a heat),
     But here I say the Turks were much mistaken,
     Who hating hogs, yet wish'd to save their bacon.

     For, on the sixteenth, at full gallop, drew
       In sight two horsemen, who were deem'd Cossacques
     For some time, till they came in nearer view.
       They had but little baggage at their backs,
     For there were but three shirts between the two;
       But on they rode upon two Ukraine hacks,
     Till, in approaching, were at length descried
     In this plain pair, Suwarrow and his guide.

     'Great joy to London now!' says some great fool,
       When London had a grand illumination,
     Which to that bottle-conjurer, John Bull,
       Is of all dreams the first hallucination;
     So that the streets of colour'd lamps are full,
       That Sage (said john) surrenders at discretion
     His purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense,
     To gratify, like a huge moth, this one sense.

     'T is strange that he should farther 'damn his eyes,'
       For they are damn'd; that once all-famous oath
     Is to the devil now no farther prize,
       Since John has lately lost the use of both.
     Debt he calls wealth, and taxes Paradise;
       And Famine, with her gaunt and bony growth,
     Which stare him in the face, he won't examine,
     Or swears that Ceres hath begotten Famine.

     But to the tale:--great joy unto the camp!
       To Russian, Tartar, English, French, Cossacque,
     O'er whom Suwarrow shone like a gas lamp,
       Presaging a most luminous attack;
     Or like a wisp along the marsh so damp,
       Which leads beholders on a boggy walk,
     He flitted to and fro a dancing light,
     Which all who saw it follow'd, wrong or right.

     But certes matters took a different face;
       There was enthusiasm and much applause,
     The fleet and camp saluted with great grace,
       And all presaged good fortune to their cause.
     Within a cannon-shot length of the place
       They drew, constructed ladders, repair'd flaws
     In former works, made new, prepared fascines,
     And all kinds of benevolent machines.

     'T is thus the spirit of a single mind
       Makes that of multitudes take one direction,
     As roll the waters to the breathing wind,
       Or roams the herd beneath the bull's protection;
     Or as a little dog will lead the blind,
       Or a bell-wether form the flock's connection
     By tinkling sounds, when they go forth to victual;
     Such is the sway of your great men o'er little.

     The whole camp rung with joy; you would have thought
       That they were going to a marriage feast
     (This metaphor, I think, holds good as aught,
       Since there is discord after both at least):
     There was not now a luggage boy but sought
       Danger and spoil with ardour much increased;
     And why? because a little--odd--old man,
     Stript to his shirt, was come to lead the van.

     But so it was; and every preparation
       Was made with all alacrity: the first
     Detachment of three columns took its station,
       And waited but the signal's voice to burst
     Upon the foe: the second's ordination
       Was also in three columns, with a thirst
     For glory gaping o'er a sea of slaughter:
     The third, in columns two, attack'd by water.

     New batteries were erected, and was held
       A general council, in which unanimity,
     That stranger to most councils, here prevail'd,
       As sometimes happens in a great extremity;
     And every difficulty being dispell'd,
       Glory began to dawn with due sublimity,
     While Souvaroff, determined to obtain it,
     Was teaching his recruits to use the bayonet

     It is an actual fact, that he, commander
       In chief, in proper person deign'd to drill
     The awkward squad, and could afford to squander
       His time, a corporal's duty to fulfil:
     Just as you 'd break a sucking salamander
       To swallow flame, and never take it ill:
     He show'd them how to mount a ladder (which
     Was not like Jacob's) or to cross a ditch.

     Also he dress'd up, for the nonce, fascines
       Like men with turbans, scimitars, and dirks,
     And made them charge with bayonet these machines,
       By way of lesson against actual Turks:
     And when well practised in these mimic scenes,
       He judged them proper to assail the works;
     At which your wise men sneer'd in phrases witty:
     He made no answer; but he took the city.

     Most things were in this posture on the eve
       Of the assault, and all the camp was in
     A stern repose; which you would scarce conceive;
       Yet men resolved to dash through thick and thin
     Are very silent when they once believe
       That all is settled:--there was little din,
     For some were thinking of their home and friends,
     And others of themselves and latter ends.

     Suwarrow chiefly was on the alert,
       Surveying, drilling, ordering, jesting, pondering;
     For the man was, we safely may assert,
       A thing to wonder at beyond most wondering;
     Hero, buffoon, half-demon, and half-dirt,
       Praying, instructing, desolating, plundering;
     Now Mars, now Momus; and when bent to storm
     A fortress, Harlequin in uniform.

     The day before the assault, while upon drill--
       For this great conqueror play'd the corporal--
     Some Cossacques, hovering like hawks round a hill,
       Had met a party towards the twilight's fall,
     One of whom spoke their tongue--or well or ill,
       'T was much that he was understood at all;
     But whether from his voice, or speech, or manner,
     They found that he had fought beneath their banner.

     Whereon immediately at his request
       They brought him and his comrades to head-quarters;
     Their dress was Moslem, but you might have guess'd
       That these were merely masquerading Tartars,
     And that beneath each Turkish-fashion'd vest
       Lurk'd Christianity; which sometimes barters
     Her inward grace for outward show, and makes
     It difficult to shun some strange mistakes.

     Suwarrow, who was standing in his shirt
       Before a company of Calmucks, drilling,
     Exclaiming, fooling, swearing at the inert,
       And lecturing on the noble art of killing,--
     For deeming human clay but common dirt,
       This great philosopher was thus instilling
     His maxims, which to martial comprehension
     Proved death in battle equal to a pension;--

     Suwarrow, when he saw this company
       Of Cossacques and their prey, turn'd round and cast
     Upon them his slow brow and piercing eye:--
       'Whence come ye?'--'From Constantinople last,
     Captives just now escaped,' was the reply.
       'What are ye?'--'What you see us.' Briefly pass'd
     This dialogue; for he who answer'd knew
     To whom he spoke, and made his words but few.

     'Your names?'--'Mine 's Johnson, and my comrade 's Juan;
       The other two are women, and the third
     Is neither man nor woman.' The chief threw on
       The party a slight glance, then said, 'I have heard
     Your name before, the second is a new one:
       To bring the other three here was absurd:
     But let that pass:--I think I have heard your name
     In the Nikolaiew regiment?'--'The same.'

     'You served at Widdin?'--'Yes.'--'You led the attack?'
       'I did.'--'What next?'--'I really hardly know.'
     'You were the first i' the breach?'--'I was not slack
       At least to follow those who might be so.'
     'What follow'd?'--'A shot laid me on my back,
       And I became a prisoner to the foe.'
     'You shall have vengeance, for the town surrounded
     Is twice as strong as that where you were wounded.

     'Where will you serve?'--'Where'er you please.'--'I know
       You like to be the hope of the forlorn,
     And doubtless would be foremost on the foe
       After the hardships you 've already borne.
     And this young fellow--say what can he do?
       He with the beardless chin and garments torn?'
     'Why, general, if he hath no greater fault
     In war than love, he had better lead the assault.'

     'He shall if that he dare.' Here Juan bow'd
       Low as the compliment deserved. Suwarrow
     Continued: 'Your old regiment's allow'd,
       By special providence, to lead to-morrow,
     Or it may be to-night, the assault: I have vow'd
       To several saints, that shortly plough or harrow
     Shall pass o'er what was Ismail, and its tusk
     Be unimpeded by the proudest mosque.

     'So now, my lads, for glory!'--Here he turn'd
       And drill'd away in the most classic Russian,
     Until each high, heroic bosom burn'd
       For cash and conquest, as if from a cushion
     A preacher had held forth (who nobly spurn'd
       All earthly goods save tithes) and bade them push on
     To slay the Pagans who resisted, battering
     The armies of the Christian Empress Catherine.

     Johnson, who knew by this long colloquy
       Himself a favourite, ventured to address
     Suwarrow, though engaged with accents high
       In his resumed amusement. 'I confess
     My debt in being thus allow'd to die
       Among the foremost; but if you 'd express
     Explicitly our several posts, my friend
     And self would know what duty to attend.'

     'Right! I was busy, and forgot. Why, you
       Will join your former regiment, which should be
     Now under arms. Ho! Katskoff, take him to
       (Here he call'd up a Polish orderly)
     His post, I mean the regiment Nikolaiew:
       The stranger stripling may remain with me;
     He 's a fine boy. The women may be sent
     To the other baggage, or to the sick tent.'

     But here a sort of scene began to ensue:
       The ladies,--who by no means had been bred
     To be disposed of in a way so new,
       Although their haram education led
     Doubtless to that of doctrines the most true,
       Passive obedience,--now raised up the head,
     With flashing eyes and starting tears, and flung
     Their arms, as hens their wings about their young,

     O'er the promoted couple of brave men
       Who were thus honour'd by the greatest chief
     That ever peopled hell with heroes slain,
       Or plunged a province or a realm in grief.
     O, foolish mortals! Always taught in vain!
       O, glorious laurel! since for one sole leaf
     Of thine imaginary deathless tree,
     Of blood and tears must flow the unebbing sea.

     Suwarrow, who had small regard for tears,
       And not much sympathy for blood, survey'd
     The women with their hair about their ears
       And natural agonies, with a slight shade
     Of feeling: for however habit sears
       Men's hearts against whole millions, when their trade
     Is butchery, sometimes a single sorrow
     Will touch even heroes--and such was Suwarrow.

     He said,--and in the kindest Calmuck tone,--
       'Why, Johnson, what the devil do you mean
     By bringing women here? They shall be shown
       All the attention possible, and seen
     In safety to the waggons, where alone
       In fact they can be safe. You should have been
     Aware this kind of baggage never thrives:
     Save wed a year, I hate recruits with wives.'

     'May it please your excellency,' thus replied
       Our British friend, 'these are the wives of others,
     And not our own. I am too qualified
       By service with my military brothers
     To break the rules by bringing one's own bride
       Into a camp: I know that nought so bothers
     The hearts of the heroic on a charge,
     As leaving a small family at large.

     'But these are but two Turkish ladies, who
       With their attendant aided our escape,
     And afterwards accompanied us through
       A thousand perils in this dubious shape.
     To me this kind of life is not so new;
       To them, poor things, it is an awkward scrape.
     I therefore, if you wish me to fight freely,
     Request that they may both be used genteelly.'

     Meantime these two poor girls, with swimming eyes,
       Look'd on as if in doubt if they could trust
     Their own protectors; nor was their surprise
       Less than their grief (and truly not less just)
     To see an old man, rather wild than wise
       In aspect, plainly clad, besmear'd with dust,
     Stript to his waistcoat, and that not too clean,
     More fear'd than all the sultans ever seen.

     For every thing seem'd resting on his nod,
       As they could read in all eyes. Now to them,
     Who were accustom'd, as a sort of god,
       To see the sultan, rich in many a gem,
     Like an imperial peacock stalk abroad
       (That royal bird, whose tail 's a diadem),
     With all the pomp of power, it was a doubt
     How power could condescend to do without.

     John Johnson, seeing their extreme dismay,
       Though little versed in feelings oriental,
     Suggested some slight comfort in his way:
       Don Juan, who was much more sentimental,
     Swore they should see him by the dawn of day,
       Or that the Russian army should repent all:
     And, strange to say, they found some consolation
     In this--for females like exaggeration.

     And then with tears, and sighs, and some slight kisses,
       They parted for the present--these to await,
     According to the artillery's hits or misses,
       What sages call Chance, Providence, or Fate
     (Uncertainty is one of many blisses,
       A mortgage on Humanity's estate)--
     While their beloved friends began to arm,
     To burn a town which never did them harm.

     Suwarrow,--who but saw things in the gross,
       Being much too gross to see them in detail,
     Who calculated life as so much dross,
       And as the wind a widow'd nation's wail,
     And cared as little for his army's loss
       (So that their efforts should at length prevail)
     As wife and friends did for the boils of job,--
     What was 't to him to hear two women sob?

     Nothing.--The work of glory still went on
       In preparations for a cannonade
     As terrible as that of Ilion,
       If Homer had found mortars ready made;
     But now, instead of slaying Priam's son,
       We only can but talk of escalade,
     Bombs, drums, guns, bastions, batteries, bayonets, bullets,--
     Hard words, which stick in the soft Muses' gullets.

     O, thou eternal Homer! who couldst charm
       All cars, though long; all ages, though so short,
     By merely wielding with poetic arm
       Arms to which men will never more resort,
     Unless gunpowder should be found to harm
       Much less than is the hope of every court,
     Which now is leagued young Freedom to annoy;
     But they will not find Liberty a Troy:--

     O, thou eternal Homer! I have now
       To paint a siege, wherein more men were slain,
     With deadlier engines and a speedier blow,
       Than in thy Greek gazette of that campaign;
     And yet, like all men else, I must allow,
       To vie with thee would be about as vain
     As for a brook to cope with ocean's flood;
     But still we moderns equal you in blood;

     If not in poetry, at least in fact;
       And fact is truth, the grand desideratum!
     Of which, howe'er the Muse describes each act,
       There should be ne'ertheless a slight substratum.
     But now the town is going to be attack'd;
       Great deeds are doing--how shall I relate 'em?
     Souls of immortal generals! Phoebus watches
     To colour up his rays from your despatches.

     O, ye great bulletins of Bonaparte!
       O, ye less grand long lists of kill'd and wounded!
     Shade of Leonidas, who fought so hearty,
       When my poor Greece was once, as now, surrounded!
     O, Caesar's Commentaries! now impart, ye
       Shadows of glory! (lest I be confounded)
     A portion of your fading twilight hues,
     So beautiful, so fleeting, to the Muse.

     When I call 'fading' martial immortality,
       I mean, that every age and every year,
     And almost every day, in sad reality,
       Some sucking hero is compell'd to rear,
     Who, when we come to sum up the totality
       Of deeds to human happiness most dear,
     Turns out to be a butcher in great business,
     Afflicting young folks with a sort of dizziness.

     Medals, rank, ribands, lace, embroidery, scarlet,
       Are things immortal to immortal man,
     As purple to the Babylonian harlot:
       An uniform to boys is like a fan
     To women; there is scarce a crimson varlet
       But deems himself the first in Glory's van.
     But Glory's glory; and if you would find
     What that is--ask the pig who sees the wind!

     At least he feels it, and some say he sees,
       Because he runs before it like a pig;
     Or, if that simple sentence should displease,
       Say, that he scuds before it like a brig,
     A schooner, or--but it is time to ease
       This Canto, ere my Muse perceives fatigue.
     The next shall ring a peal to shake all people,
     Like a bob-major from a village steeple.

     Hark! through the silence of the cold, dull night,
       The hum of armies gathering rank on rank!
     Lo! dusky masses steal in dubious sight
       Along the leaguer'd wall and bristling bank
     Of the arm'd river, while with straggling light
       The stars peep through the vapours dim and dank,
     Which curl in curious wreaths:--how soon the smoke
     Of Hell shall pall them in a deeper cloak!

     Here pause we for the present--as even then
       That awful pause, dividing life from death,
     Struck for an instant on the hearts of men,
       Thousands of whom were drawing their last breath!
     A moment--and all will be life again!
       The march! the charge! the shouts of either faith!
     Hurra! and Allah! and--one moment more,
     The death-cry drowning in the battle's roar.


[Illustration: Canto 8]




CANTO THE EIGHTH.

     O blood and thunder! and oh blood and wounds!
       These are but vulgar oaths, as you may deem,
     Too gentle reader! and most shocking sounds:
       And so they are; yet thus is Glory's dream
     Unriddled, and as my true Muse expounds
       At present such things, since they are her theme,
     So be they her inspirers! Call them Mars,
     Bellona, what you will--they mean but wars.

     All was prepared--the fire, the sword, the men
       To wield them in their terrible array.
     The army, like a lion from his den,
       March'd forth with nerve and sinews bent to slay,--
     A human Hydra, issuing from its fen
       To breathe destruction on its winding way,
     Whose heads were heroes, which cut off in vain
     Immediately in others grew again.

     History can only take things in the gross;
       But could we know them in detail, perchance
     In balancing the profit and the loss,
       War's merit it by no means might enhance,
     To waste so much gold for a little dross,
       As hath been done, mere conquest to advance.
     The drying up a single tear has more
     Of honest fame, than shedding seas of gore.

     And why?--because it brings self-approbation;
       Whereas the other, after all its glare,
     Shouts, bridges, arches, pensions from a nation,
       Which (it may be) has not much left to spare,
     A higher title, or a loftier station,
       Though they may make Corruption gape or stare,
     Yet, in the end, except in Freedom's battles,
     Are nothing but a child of Murder's rattles.

     And such they are--and such they will be found:
       Not so Leonidas and Washington,
     Whose every battle-field is holy ground,
       Which breathes of nations saved, not worlds undone.
     How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!
       While the mere victor's may appal or stun
     The servile and the vain, such names will be
     A watchword till the future shall be free.

     The night was dark, and the thick mist allow'd
       Nought to be seen save the artillery's flame,
     Which arch'd the horizon like a fiery cloud,
       And in the Danube's waters shone the same--
     A mirror'd hell! the volleying roar, and loud
       Long booming of each peal on peal, o'ercame
     The ear far more than thunder; for Heaven's flashes
     Spare, or smite rarely--man's make millions ashes!

     The column order'd on the assault scarce pass'd
       Beyond the Russian batteries a few toises,
     When up the bristling Moslem rose at last,
       Answering the Christian thunders with like voices:
     Then one vast fire, air, earth, and stream embraced,
       Which rock'd as 't were beneath the mighty noises;
     While the whole rampart blazed like Etna, when
     The restless Titan hiccups in his den.

     And one enormous shout of 'Allah!' rose
       In the same moment, loud as even the roar
     Of war's most mortal engines, to their foes
       Hurling defiance: city, stream, and shore
     Resounded 'Allah!' and the clouds which close
       With thick'ning canopy the conflict o'er,
     Vibrate to the Eternal name. Hark! through
     All sounds it pierceth 'Allah! Allah! Hu!'

     The columns were in movement one and all,
       But of the portion which attack'd by water,
     Thicker than leaves the lives began to fall,
       Though led by Arseniew, that great son of slaughter,
     As brave as ever faced both bomb and ball.
       'Carnage' (so Wordsworth tells you) 'is God's daughter:'
     If he speak truth, she is Christ's sister, and
     Just now behaved as in the Holy Land.

     The Prince de Ligne was wounded in the knee;
       Count Chapeau-Bras, too, had a ball between
     His cap and head, which proves the head to be
       Aristocratic as was ever seen,
     Because it then received no injury
       More than the cap; in fact, the ball could mean
     No harm unto a right legitimate head:
     'Ashes to ashes'--why not lead to lead?

     Also the General Markow, Brigadier,
       Insisting on removal of the prince
     Amidst some groaning thousands dying near,--
       All common fellows, who might writhe and wince,
     And shriek for water into a deaf ear,--
       The General Markow, who could thus evince
     His sympathy for rank, by the same token,
     To teach him greater, had his own leg broken.

     Three hundred cannon threw up their emetic,
       And thirty thousand muskets flung their pills
     Like hail, to make a bloody diuretic.
       Mortality! thou hast thy monthly bills;
     Thy plagues, thy famines, thy physicians, yet tick,
       Like the death-watch, within our ears the ills
     Past, present, and to come;--but all may yield
     To the true portrait of one battle-field.

     There the still varying pangs, which multiply
       Until their very number makes men hard
     By the infinities of agony,
       Which meet the gaze whate'er it may regard--
     The groan, the roll in dust, the all-white eye
       Turn'd back within its socket,--these reward
     Your rank and file by thousands, while the rest
     May win perhaps a riband at the breast!

     Yet I love glory;--glory 's a great thing:--
       Think what it is to be in your old age
     Maintain'd at the expense of your good king:
       A moderate pension shakes full many a sage,
     And heroes are but made for bards to sing,
       Which is still better; thus in verse to wage
     Your wars eternally, besides enjoying
     Half-pay for life, make mankind worth destroying.

     The troops, already disembark'd, push'd on
       To take a battery on the right; the others,
     Who landed lower down, their landing done,
       Had set to work as briskly as their brothers:
     Being grenadiers, they mounted one by one,
       Cheerful as children climb the breasts of mothers,
     O'er the entrenchment and the palisade,
     Quite orderly, as if upon parade.

     And this was admirable; for so hot
       The fire was, that were red Vesuvius loaded,
     Besides its lava, with all sorts of shot
       And shells or hells, it could not more have goaded.
     Of officers a third fell on the spot,
       A thing which victory by no means boded
     To gentlemen engaged in the assault:
     Hounds, when the huntsman tumbles, are at fault.

     But here I leave the general concern,
       To track our hero on his path of fame:
     He must his laurels separately earn;
       For fifty thousand heroes, name by name,
     Though all deserving equally to turn
       A couplet, or an elegy to claim,
     Would form a lengthy lexicon of glory,
     And what is worse still, a much longer story:

     And therefore we must give the greater number
       To the Gazette--which doubtless fairly dealt
     By the deceased, who lie in famous slumber
       In ditches, fields, or wheresoe'er they felt
     Their clay for the last time their souls encumber;--
       Thrice happy he whose name has been well spelt
     In the despatch: I knew a man whose loss
     Was printed Grove, although his name was Grose.

     Juan and Johnson join'd a certain corps,
       And fought away with might and main, not knowing
     The way which they had never trod before,
       And still less guessing where they might be going;
     But on they march'd, dead bodies trampling o'er,
       Firing, and thrusting, slashing, sweating, glowing,
     But fighting thoughtlessly enough to win,
     To their two selves, one whole bright bulletin.

     Thus on they wallow'd in the bloody mire
       Of dead and dying thousands,--sometimes gaining
     A yard or two of ground, which brought them nigher
       To some odd angle for which all were straining;
     At other times, repulsed by the close fire,
       Which really pour'd as if all hell were raining
     Instead of heaven, they stumbled backwards o'er
     A wounded comrade, sprawling in his gore.

     Though 't was Don Juan's first of fields, and though
       The nightly muster and the silent march
     In the chill dark, when courage does not glow
       So much as under a triumphal arch,
     Perhaps might make him shiver, yawn, or throw
       A glance on the dull clouds (as thick as starch,
     Which stiffen'd heaven) as if he wish'd for day;--
     Yet for all this he did not run away.

     Indeed he could not. But what if he had?
       There have been and are heroes who begun
     With something not much better, or as bad:
       Frederic the Great from Molwitz deign'd to run,
     For the first and last time; for, like a pad,
       Or hawk, or bride, most mortals after one
     Warm bout are broken into their new tricks,
     And fight like fiends for pay or politics.

     He was what Erin calls, in her sublime
       Old Erse or Irish, or it may be Punic
     (The antiquarians who can settle time,
       Which settles all things, Roman, Greek, or Runic,
     Swear that Pat's language sprung from the same clime
       With Hannibal, and wears the Tyrian tunic
     Of Dido's alphabet; and this is rational
     As any other notion, and not national);--

     But Juan was quite 'a broth of a boy,'
       A thing of impulse and a child of song;
     Now swimming in the sentiment of joy,
       Or the sensation (if that phrase seem wrong),
     And afterward, if he must needs destroy,
       In such good company as always throng
     To battles, sieges, and that kind of pleasure,
     No less delighted to employ his leisure;

     But always without malice: if he warr'd
       Or loved, it was with what we call 'the best
     Intentions,' which form all mankind's trump card,
       To be produced when brought up to the test.
     The statesman, hero, harlot, lawyer--ward
       Off each attack, when people are in quest
     Of their designs, by saying they meant well;
     'T is pity 'that such meaning should pave hell.'

     I almost lately have begun to doubt
       Whether hell's pavement--if it be so paved--
     Must not have latterly been quite worn out,
       Not by the numbers good intent hath saved,
     But by the mass who go below without
       Those ancient good intentions, which once shaved
     And smooth'd the brimstone of that street of hell
     Which bears the greatest likeness to Pall Mall.

     Juan, by some strange chance, which oft divides
       Warrior from warrior in their grim career,
     Like chastest wives from constant husbands' sides
       Just at the close of the first bridal year,
     By one of those odd turns of Fortune's tides,
       Was on a sudden rather puzzled here,
     When, after a good deal of heavy firing,
     He found himself alone, and friends retiring.

     I don't know how the thing occurr'd--it might
       Be that the greater part were kill'd or wounded,
     And that the rest had faced unto the right
       About; a circumstance which has confounded
     Caesar himself, who, in the very sight
       Of his whole army, which so much abounded
     In courage, was obliged to snatch a shield,
     And rally back his Romans to the field.

     Juan, who had no shield to snatch, and was
       No Caesar, but a fine young lad, who fought
     He knew not why, arriving at this pass,
       Stopp'd for a minute, as perhaps he ought
     For a much longer time; then, like an as
       (Start not, kind reader; since great Homer thought
     This simile enough for Ajax, Juan
     Perhaps may find it better than a new one)--

     Then, like an ass, he went upon his way,
       And, what was stranger, never look'd behind;
     But seeing, flashing forward, like the day
       Over the hills, a fire enough to blind
     Those who dislike to look upon a fray,
       He stumbled on, to try if he could find
     A path, to add his own slight arm and forces
     To corps, the greater part of which were corses.

     Perceiving then no more the commandant
       Of his own corps, nor even the corps, which had
     Quite disappear'd--the gods know howl (I can't
       Account for every thing which may look bad
     In history; but we at least may grant
       It was not marvellous that a mere lad,
     In search of glory, should look on before,
     Nor care a pinch of snuff about his corps):--

     Perceiving nor commander nor commanded,
       And left at large, like a young heir, to make
     His way to--where he knew not--single handed;
       As travellers follow over bog and brake
     An 'ignis fatuus;' or as sailors stranded
       Unto the nearest hut themselves betake;
     So Juan, following honour and his nose,
     Rush'd where the thickest fire announced most foes.

     He knew not where he was, nor greatly cared,
       For he was dizzy, busy, and his veins
     Fill'd as with lightning--for his spirit shared
       The hour, as is the case with lively brains;
     And where the hottest fire was seen and heard,
       And the loud cannon peal'd his hoarsest strains,
     He rush'd, while earth and air were sadly shaken
     By thy humane discovery, Friar Bacon!

     And as he rush'd along, it came to pass he
       Fell in with what was late the second column,
     Under the orders of the General Lascy,
       But now reduced, as is a bulky volume
     Into an elegant extract (much less massy)
       Of heroism, and took his place with solemn
     Air 'midst the rest, who kept their valiant faces
     And levell'd weapons still against the glacis.

     Just at this crisis up came Johnson too,
       Who had 'retreated,' as the phrase is when
     Men run away much rather than go through
       Destruction's jaws into the devil's den;
     But Johnson was a clever fellow, who
       Knew when and how 'to cut and come again,'
     And never ran away, except when running
     Was nothing but a valorous kind of cunning.

     And so, when all his corps were dead or dying,
       Except Don Juan, a mere novice, whose
     More virgin valour never dreamt of flying
       From ignorance of danger, which indues
     Its votaries, like innocence relying
       On its own strength, with careless nerves and thews,--
     Johnson retired a little, just to rally
     Those who catch cold in 'shadows of Death's valley.'

     And there, a little shelter'd from the shot,
       Which rain'd from bastion, battery, parapet,
     Rampart, wall, casement, house,--for there was not
       In this extensive city, sore beset
     By Christian soldiery, a single spot
       Which did not combat like the devil, as yet,
     He found a number of Chasseurs, all scatter'd
     By the resistance of the chase they batter'd.

     And these he call'd on; and, what 's strange, they came
       Unto his call, unlike 'the spirits from
     The vasty deep,' to whom you may exclaim,
       Says Hotspur, long ere they will leave their home.
     Their reasons were uncertainty, or shame
       At shrinking from a bullet or a bomb,
     And that odd impulse, which in wars or creeds
     Makes men, like cattle, follow him who leads.

     By Jove! he was a noble fellow, Johnson,
       And though his name, than Ajax or Achilles,
     Sounds less harmonious, underneath the sun soon
       We shall not see his likeness: he could kill his
     Man quite as quietly as blows the monsoon
       Her steady breath (which some months the same still is):
     Seldom he varied feature, hue, or muscle,
     And could be very busy without bustle;

     And therefore, when he ran away, he did so
       Upon reflection, knowing that behind
     He would find others who would fain be rid so
       Of idle apprehensions, which like wind
     Trouble heroic stomachs. Though their lids so
       Oft are soon closed, all heroes are not blind,
     But when they light upon immediate death,
     Retire a little, merely to take breath.

     But Johnson only ran off, to return
       With many other warriors, as we said,
     Unto that rather somewhat misty bourn,
       Which Hamlet tells us is a pass of dread.
     To Jack howe'er this gave but slight concern:
       His soul (like galvanism upon the dead)
     Acted upon the living as on wire,
     And led them back into the heaviest fire.

     Egad! they found the second time what they
       The first time thought quite terrible enough
     To fly from, malgre all which people say
       Of glory, and all that immortal stuff
     Which fills a regiment (besides their pay,
       That daily shilling which makes warriors tough)--
     They found on their return the self-same welcome,
     Which made some think, and others know, a hell come.

     They fell as thick as harvests beneath hail,
       Grass before scythes, or corn below the sickle,
     Proving that trite old truth, that life 's as frail
       As any other boon for which men stickle.
     The Turkish batteries thrash'd them like a flail,
       Or a good boxer, into a sad pickle
     Putting the very bravest, who were knock'd
     Upon the head, before their guns were cock'd.

     The Turks, behind the traverses and flanks
       Of the next bastion, fired away like devils,
     And swept, as gales sweep foam away, whole ranks:
       However, Heaven knows how, the Fate who levels
     Towns, nations, worlds, in her revolving pranks,
       So order'd it, amidst these sulphury revels,
     That Johnson and some few who had not scamper'd,
     Reach'd the interior talus of the rampart.

     First one or two, then five, six, and a dozen,
       Came mounting quickly up, for it was now
     All neck or nothing, as, like pitch or rosin,
       Flame was shower'd forth above, as well 's below,
     So that you scarce could say who best had chosen,
       The gentlemen that were the first to show
     Their martial faces on the parapet,
     Or those who thought it brave to wait as yet.

     But those who scaled, found out that their advance
       Was favour'd by an accident or blunder:
     The Greek or Turkish Cohorn's ignorance
       Had palisado'd in a way you 'd wonder
     To see in forts of Netherlands or France
       (Though these to our Gibraltar must knock under)--
     Right in the middle of the parapet
     Just named, these palisades were primly set:

     So that on either side some nine or ten
       Paces were left, whereon you could contrive
     To march; a great convenience to our men,
       At least to all those who were left alive,
     Who thus could form a line and fight again;
       And that which farther aided them to strive
     Was, that they could kick down the palisades,
     Which scarcely rose much higher than grass blades.

     Among the first,--I will not say the first,
       For such precedence upon such occasions
     Will oftentimes make deadly quarrels burst
       Out between friends as well as allied nations:
     The Briton must be bold who really durst
       Put to such trial John Bull's partial patience,
     As say that Wellington at Waterloo
     Was beaten--though the Prussians say so too;--

     And that if Blucher, Bulow, Gneisenau,
       And God knows who besides in 'au' and 'ow,'
     Had not come up in time to cast an awe
       Into the hearts of those who fought till now
     As tigers combat with an empty craw,
       The Duke of Wellington had ceased to show
     His orders, also to receive his pensions,
     Which are the heaviest that our history mentions.

     But never mind;--'God save the king!' and kings!
       For if he don't, I doubt if men will longer--
     I think I hear a little bird, who sings
       The people by and by will be the stronger:
     The veriest jade will wince whose harness wrings
       So much into the raw as quite to wrong her
     Beyond the rules of posting,--and the mob
     At last fall sick of imitating Job.

     At first it grumbles, then it swears, and then,
       Like David, flings smooth pebbles 'gainst a giant;
     At last it takes to weapons such as men
       Snatch when despair makes human hearts less pliant.
     Then comes 'the tug of war;'--'t will come again,
       I rather doubt; and I would fain say 'fie on 't,'
     If I had not perceived that revolution
     Alone can save the earth from hell's pollution.

     But to continue:--I say not the first,
       But of the first, our little friend Don Juan
     Walk'd o'er the walls of Ismail, as if nursed
       Amidst such scenes--though this was quite a new one
     To him, and I should hope to most. The thirst
       Of glory, which so pierces through and through one,
     Pervaded him--although a generous creature,
     As warm in heart as feminine in feature.

     And here he was--who upon woman's breast,
       Even from a child, felt like a child; howe'er
     The man in all the rest might be confest,
       To him it was Elysium to be there;
     And he could even withstand that awkward test
       Which Rousseau points out to the dubious fair,
     'Observe your lover when he leaves your arms;'
     But Juan never left them, while they had charms,

     Unless compell'd by fate, or wave, or wind,
       Or near relations, who are much the same.
     But here he was!--where each tie that can bind
       Humanity must yield to steel and flame:
     And he whose very body was all mind,
       Flung here by fate or circumstance, which tame
     The loftiest, hurried by the time and place,
     Dash'd on like a spurr'd blood-horse in a race.

     So was his blood stirr'd while he found resistance,
       As is the hunter's at the five-bar gate,
     Or double post and rail, where the existence
       Of Britain's youth depends upon their weight,
     The lightest being the safest: at a distance
       He hated cruelty, as all men hate
     Blood, until heated--and even then his own
     At times would curdle o'er some heavy groan.

     The General Lascy, who had been hard press'd,
       Seeing arrive an aid so opportune
     As were some hundred youngsters all abreast,
       Who came as if just dropp'd down from the moon,
     To Juan, who was nearest him, address'd
       His thanks, and hopes to take the city soon,
     Not reckoning him to be a 'base Bezonian'
     (As Pistol calls it), but a young Livonian.

     Juan, to whom he spoke in German, knew
       As much of German as of Sanscrit, and
     In answer made an inclination to
       The general who held him in command;
     For seeing one with ribands, black and blue,
       Stars, medals, and a bloody sword in hand,
     Addressing him in tones which seem'd to thank,
     He recognised an officer of rank.

     Short speeches pass between two men who speak
       No common language; and besides, in time
     Of war and taking towns, when many a shriek
       Rings o'er the dialogue, and many a crime
     Is perpetrated ere a word can break
       Upon the ear, and sounds of horror chime
     In like church-bells, with sigh, howl, groan, yell, prayer,
     There cannot be much conversation there.

     And therefore all we have related in
       Two long octaves, pass'd in a little minute;
     But in the same small minute, every sin
       Contrived to get itself comprised within it.
     The very cannon, deafen'd by the din,
       Grew dumb, for you might almost hear a linnet,
     As soon as thunder, 'midst the general noise
     Of human nature's agonising voice!

     The town was enter'd. Oh eternity!-
       'God made the country and man made the town,'
     So Cowper says--and I begin to be
       Of his opinion, when I see cast down
     Rome, Babylon, Tyre, Carthage, Nineveh,
       All walls men know, and many never known;
     And pondering on the present and the past,
     To deem the woods shall be our home at last

     Of all men, saving Sylla the man-slayer,
       Who passes for in life and death most lucky,
     Of the great names which in our faces stare,
       The General Boon, back-woodsman of Kentucky,
     Was happiest amongst mortals anywhere;
       For killing nothing but a bear or buck, he
     Enjoy'd the lonely, vigorous, harmless days
     Of his old age in wilds of deepest maze.

     Crime came not near him--she is not the child
       Of solitude; Health shrank not from him--for
     Her home is in the rarely trodden wild,
       Where if men seek her not, and death be more
     Their choice than life, forgive them, as beguiled
       By habit to what their own hearts abhor--
     In cities caged. The present case in point I
     Cite is, that Boon lived hunting up to ninety;

     And what 's still stranger, left behind a name
       For which men vainly decimate the throng,
     Not only famous, but of that good fame,
       Without which glory 's but a tavern song--
     Simple, serene, the antipodes of shame,
       Which hate nor envy e'er could tinge with wrong;
     An active hermit, even in age the child
     Of Nature, or the man of Ross run wild.

     'T is true he shrank from men even of his nation,
       When they built up unto his darling trees,--
     He moved some hundred miles off, for a station
       Where there were fewer houses and more ease;
     The inconvenience of civilisation
       Is, that you neither can be pleased nor please;
     But where he met the individual man,
     He show'd himself as kind as mortal can.

     He was not all alone: around him grew
       A sylvan tribe of children of the chase,
     Whose young, unwaken'd world was ever new,
       Nor sword nor sorrow yet had left a trace
     On her unwrinkled brow, nor could you view
       A frown on Nature's or on human face;
     The free-born forest found and kept them free,
     And fresh as is a torrent or a tree.

     And tall, and strong, and swift of foot were they,
       Beyond the dwarfing city's pale abortions,
     Because their thoughts had never been the prey
       Of care or gain: the green woods were their portions;
     No sinking spirits told them they grew grey,
       No fashion made them apes of her distortions;
     Simple they were, not savage; and their rifles,
     Though very true, were not yet used for trifles.

     Motion was in their days, rest in their slumbers,
       And cheerfulness the handmaid of their toil;
     Nor yet too many nor too few their numbers;
       Corruption could not make their hearts her soil;
     The lust which stings, the splendour which encumbers,
       With the free foresters divide no spoil;
     Serene, not sullen, were the solitudes
     Of this unsighing people of the woods.

     So much for Nature:--by way of variety,
       Now back to thy great joys, Civilisation!
     And the sweet consequence of large society,
       War, pestilence, the despot's desolation,
     The kingly scourge, the lust of notoriety,
       The millions slain by soldiers for their ration,
     The scenes like Catherine's boudoir at threescore,
     With Ismail's storm to soften it the more.

     The town was enter'd: first one column made
       Its sanguinary way good--then another;
     The reeking bayonet and the flashing blade
       Clash'd 'gainst the scimitar, and babe and mother
     With distant shrieks were heard Heaven to upbraid:
       Still closer sulphury clouds began to smother
     The breath of morn and man, where foot by foot
     The madden'd Turks their city still dispute.

     Koutousow, he who afterward beat back
       (With some assistance from the frost and snow)
     Napoleon on his bold and bloody track,
       It happen'd was himself beat back just now;
     He was a jolly fellow, and could crack
       His jest alike in face of friend or foe,
     Though life, and death, and victory were at stake;
     But here it seem'd his jokes had ceased to take:

     For having thrown himself into a ditch,
       Follow'd in haste by various grenadiers,
     Whose blood the puddle greatly did enrich,
       He climb'd to where the parapet appears;
     But there his project reach'd its utmost pitch
       ('Mongst other deaths the General Ribaupierre's
     Was much regretted), for the Moslem men
     Threw them all down into the ditch again.

     And had it not been for some stray troops landing
       They knew not where, being carried by the stream
     To some spot, where they lost their understanding,
       And wander'd up and down as in a dream,
     Until they reach'd, as daybreak was expanding,
       That which a portal to their eyes did seem,--
     The great and gay Koutousow might have lain
     Where three parts of his column yet remain.

     And scrambling round the rampart, these same troops,
       After the taking of the 'Cavalier,'
     Just as Koutousow's most 'forlorn' of 'hopes'
       Took like chameleons some slight tinge of fear,
     Open'd the gate call'd 'Kilia,' to the groups
       Of baffled heroes, who stood shyly near,
     Sliding knee-deep in lately frozen mud,
     Now thaw'd into a marsh of human blood.

     The Kozacks, or, if so you please, Cossacques
       (I don't much pique myself upon orthography,
     So that I do not grossly err in facts,
       Statistics, tactics, politics, and geography)--
     Having been used to serve on horses' backs,
       And no great dilettanti in topography
     Of fortresses, but fighting where it pleases
     Their chiefs to order,--were all cut to pieces.

     Their column, though the Turkish batteries thunder'd
       Upon them, ne'ertheless had reach'd the rampart,
     And naturally thought they could have plunder'd
       The city, without being farther hamper'd;
     But as it happens to brave men, they blunder'd--
       The Turks at first pretended to have scamper'd,
     Only to draw them 'twixt two bastion corners,
     From whence they sallied on those Christian scorners.

     Then being taken by the tail--a taking
       Fatal to bishops as to soldiers--these
     Cossacques were all cut off as day was breaking,
       And found their lives were let at a short lease--
     But perish'd without shivering or shaking,
       Leaving as ladders their heap'd carcasses,
     O'er which Lieutenant-Colonel Yesouskoi
     March'd with the brave battalion of Polouzki:--

     This valiant man kill'd all the Turks he met,
       But could not eat them, being in his turn
     Slain by some Mussulmans, who would not yet,
       Without resistance, see their city burn.
     The walls were won, but 't was an even bet
       Which of the armies would have cause to mourn:
     'T was blow for blow, disputing inch by inch,
     For one would not retreat, nor t' other flinch.

     Another column also suffer'd much:--
       And here we may remark with the historian,
     You should but give few cartridges to such
       Troops as are meant to march with greatest glory on:
     When matters must be carried by the touch
       Of the bright bayonet, and they all should hurry on,
     They sometimes, with a hankering for existence,
     Keep merely firing at a foolish distance.

     A junction of the General Meknop's men
       (Without the General, who had fallen some time
     Before, being badly seconded just then)
       Was made at length with those who dared to climb
     The death-disgorging rampart once again;
       And though the Turk's resistance was sublime,
     They took the bastion, which the Seraskier
     Defended at a price extremely dear.

     Juan and Johnson, and some volunteers,
       Among the foremost, offer'd him good quarter,
     A word which little suits with Seraskiers,
       Or at least suited not this valiant Tartar.
     He died, deserving well his country's tears,
       A savage sort of military martyr.
     An English naval officer, who wish'd
     To make him prisoner, was also dish'd:

     For all the answer to his proposition
       Was from a pistol-shot that laid him dead;
     On which the rest, without more intermission,
       Began to lay about with steel and lead--
     The pious metals most in requisition
       On such occasions: not a single head
     Was spared;--three thousand Moslems perish'd here,
     And sixteen bayonets pierced the Seraskier.

     The city 's taken--only part by part--
       And death is drunk with gore: there 's not a street
     Where fights not to the last some desperate heart
       For those for whom it soon shall cease to beat.
     Here War forgot his own destructive art
       In more destroying Nature; and the heat
     Of carnage, like the Nile's sun-sodden slime,
     Engender'd monstrous shapes of every crime.

     A Russian officer, in martial tread
       Over a heap of bodies, felt his heel
     Seized fast, as if 't were by the serpent's head
       Whose fangs Eve taught her human seed to feel:
     In vain he kick'd, and swore, and writhed, and bled,
       And howl'd for help as wolves do for a meal--
     The teeth still kept their gratifying hold,
     As do the subtle snakes described of old.

     A dying Moslem, who had felt the foot
       Of a foe o'er him, snatch'd at it, and bit
     The very tendon which is most acute
       (That which some ancient Muse or modern wit
     Named after thee, Achilles), and quite through 't
       He made the teeth meet, nor relinquish'd it
     Even with his life--for (but they lie) 't is said
     To the live leg still clung the sever'd head.

     However this may be, 't is pretty sure
       The Russian officer for life was lamed,
     For the Turk's teeth stuck faster than a skewer,
       And left him 'midst the invalid and maim'd:
     The regimental surgeon could not cure
       His patient, and perhaps was to be blamed
     More than the head of the inveterate foe,
     Which was cut off, and scarce even then let go.

     But then the fact 's a fact--and 't is the part
       Of a true poet to escape from fiction
     Whene'er he can; for there is little art
       In leaving verse more free from the restriction
     Of truth than prose, unless to suit the mart
       For what is sometimes called poetic diction,
     And that outrageous appetite for lies
     Which Satan angles with for souls, like flies.

     The city 's taken, but not render'd!--No!
       There 's not a Moslem that hath yielded sword:
     The blood may gush out, as the Danube's flow
       Rolls by the city wall; but deed nor word
     Acknowledge aught of dread of death or foe:
       In vain the yell of victory is roar'd
     By the advancing Muscovite--the groan
     Of the last foe is echoed by his own.

     The bayonet pierces and the sabre cleaves,
       And human lives are lavish'd everywhere,
     As the year closing whirls the scarlet leaves
       When the stripp'd forest bows to the bleak air,
     And groans; and thus the peopled city grieves,
       Shorn of its best and loveliest, and left bare;
     But still it falls in vast and awful splinters,
     As oaks blown down with all their thousand winters.

     It is an awful topic--but 't is not
       My cue for any time to be terrific:
     For checker'd as is seen our human lot
       With good, and bad, and worse, alike prolific
     Of melancholy merriment, to quote
       Too much of one sort would be soporific;--
     Without, or with, offence to friends or foes,
     I sketch your world exactly as it goes.

     And one good action in the midst of crimes
       Is 'quite refreshing,' in the affected phrase
     Of these ambrosial, Pharisaic times,
       With all their pretty milk-and-water ways,
     And may serve therefore to bedew these rhymes,
       A little scorch'd at present with the blaze
     Of conquest and its consequences, which
     Make epic poesy so rare and rich.

     Upon a taken bastion, where there lay
       Thousands of slaughter'd men, a yet warm group
     Of murder'd women, who had found their way
       To this vain refuge, made the good heart droop
     And shudder;--while, as beautiful as May,
       A female child of ten years tried to stoop
     And hide her little palpitating breast
     Amidst the bodies lull'd in bloody rest.

     Two villainous Cossacques pursued the child
       With flashing eyes and weapons: match'd with them,
     The rudest brute that roams Siberia's wild
       Has feelings pure and polish'd as a gem,--
     The bear is civilised, the wolf is mild;
       And whom for this at last must we condemn?
     Their natures? or their sovereigns, who employ
     All arts to teach their subjects to destroy?

     Their sabres glitter'd o'er her little head,
       Whence her fair hair rose twining with affright,
     Her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead:
       When Juan caught a glimpse of this sad sight,
     I shall not say exactly what he said,
       Because it might not solace 'ears polite;'
     But what he did, was to lay on their backs,
     The readiest way of reasoning with Cossacques.

     One's hip he slash'd, and split the other's shoulder,
       And drove them with their brutal yells to seek
     If there might be chirurgeons who could solder
       The wounds they richly merited, and shriek
     Their baffled rage and pain; while waxing colder
       As he turn'd o'er each pale and gory cheek,
     Don Juan raised his little captive from
     The heap a moment more had made her tomb.

     And she was chill as they, and on her face
       A slender streak of blood announced how near
     Her fate had been to that of all her race;
       For the same blow which laid her mother here
     Had scarr'd her brow, and left its crimson trace,
       As the last link with all she had held dear;
     But else unhurt, she open'd her large eyes,
     And gazed on Juan with a wild surprise.

     Just at this instant, while their eyes were fix'd
       Upon each other, with dilated glance,
     In Juan's look, pain, pleasure, hope, fear, mix'd
       With joy to save, and dread of some mischance
     Unto his protege; while hers, transfix'd
       With infant terrors, glared as from a trance,
     A pure, transparent, pale, yet radiant face,
     Like to a lighted alabaster vase;--

     Up came John Johnson (I will not say 'Jack,'
       For that were vulgar, cold, and commonplace
     On great occasions, such as an attack
       On cities, as hath been the present case):
     Up Johnson came, with hundreds at his back,
       Exclaiming;--'Juan! Juan! On, boy! brace
     Your arm, and I 'll bet Moscow to a dollar
     That you and I will win St. George's collar.

     'The Seraskier is knock'd upon the head,
       But the stone bastion still remains, wherein
     The old Pacha sits among some hundreds dead,
       Smoking his pipe quite calmly 'midst the din
     Of our artillery and his own: 't is said
       Our kill'd, already piled up to the chin,
     Lie round the battery; but still it batters,
     And grape in volleys, like a vineyard, scatters.

     'Then up with me!'--But Juan answer'd, 'Look
       Upon this child--I saved her--must not leave
     Her life to chance; but point me out some nook
       Of safety, where she less may shrink and grieve,
     And I am with you.'--Whereon Johnson took
       A glance around--and shrugg'd--and twitch'd his sleeve
     And black silk neckcloth--and replied, 'You 're right;
     Poor thing! what 's to be done? I 'm puzzled quite.'

     Said Juan: 'Whatsoever is to be
       Done, I 'll not quit her till she seems secure
     Of present life a good deal more than we.'
       Quoth Johnson: 'Neither will I quite ensure;
     But at the least you may die gloriously.'
       Juan replied: 'At least I will endure
     Whate'er is to be borne--but not resign
     This child, who is parentless, and therefore mine.'

     Johnson said: 'Juan, we 've no time to lose;
       The child 's a pretty child--a very pretty--
     I never saw such eyes--but hark! now choose
       Between your fame and feelings, pride and pity;--
     Hark! how the roar increases!--no excuse
       Will serve when there is plunder in a city;--
     I should be loth to march without you, but,
     By God! we 'll be too late for the first cut.'

     But Juan was immovable; until
       Johnson, who really loved him in his way,
     Pick'd out amongst his followers with some skill
       Such as he thought the least given up to prey;
     And swearing if the infant came to ill
       That they should all be shot on the next day;
     But if she were deliver'd safe and sound,
     They should at least have fifty rubles round,

     And all allowances besides of plunder
       In fair proportion with their comrades;--then
     Juan consented to march on through thunder,
       Which thinn'd at every step their ranks of men:
     And yet the rest rush'd eagerly--no wonder,
       For they were heated by the hope of gain,
     A thing which happens everywhere each day--
     No hero trusteth wholly to half pay.

     And such is victory, and such is man!
       At least nine tenths of what we call so;--God
     May have another name for half we scan
       As human beings, or his ways are odd.
     But to our subject: a brave Tartar khan--
       Or 'sultan,' as the author (to whose nod
     In prose I bend my humble verse) doth call
     This chieftain--somehow would not yield at all:

     But flank'd by five brave sons (such is polygamy,
       That she spawns warriors by the score, where none
     Are prosecuted for that false crime bigamy),
       He never would believe the city won
     While courage clung but to a single twig.--Am I
       Describing Priam's, Peleus', or Jove's son?
     Neither--but a good, plain, old, temperate man,
     Who fought with his five children in the van.

     To take him was the point. The truly brave,
       When they behold the brave oppress'd with odds,
     Are touch'd with a desire to shield and save;--
       A mixture of wild beasts and demigods
     Are they--now furious as the sweeping wave,
       Now moved with pity: even as sometimes nods
     The rugged tree unto the summer wind,
     Compassion breathes along the savage mind.

     But he would not be taken, and replied
       To all the propositions of surrender
     By mowing Christians down on every side,
       As obstinate as Swedish Charles at Bender.
     His five brave boys no less the foe defied;
       Whereon the Russian pathos grew less tender,
     As being a virtue, like terrestrial patience,
     Apt to wear out on trifling provocations.

     And spite of Johnson and of Juan, who
       Expended all their Eastern phraseology
     In begging him, for God's sake, just to show
       So much less fight as might form an apology
     For them in saving such a desperate foe--
       He hew'd away, like doctors of theology
     When they dispute with sceptics; and with curses
     Struck at his friends, as babies beat their nurses.

     Nay, he had wounded, though but slightly, both
       Juan and Johnson; whereupon they fell,
     The first with sighs, the second with an oath,
       Upon his angry sultanship, pell-mell,
     And all around were grown exceeding wroth
       At such a pertinacious infidel,
     And pour'd upon him and his sons like rain,
     Which they resisted like a sandy plain

     That drinks and still is dry. At last they perish'd--
       His second son was levell'd by a shot;
     His third was sabred; and the fourth, most cherish'd
       Of all the five, on bayonets met his lot;
     The fifth, who, by a Christian mother nourish'd,
       Had been neglected, ill-used, and what not,
     Because deform'd, yet died all game and bottom,
     To save a sire who blush'd that he begot him.

     The eldest was a true and tameless Tartar,
       As great a scorner of the Nazarene
     As ever Mahomet pick'd out for a martyr,
       Who only saw the black-eyed girls in green,
     Who make the beds of those who won't take quarter
       On earth, in Paradise; and when once seen,
     Those houris, like all other pretty creatures,
     Do just whate'er they please, by dint of features.

     And what they pleased to do with the young khan
       In heaven I know not, nor pretend to guess;
     But doubtless they prefer a fine young man
       To tough old heroes, and can do no less;
     And that 's the cause no doubt why, if we scan
       A field of battle's ghastly wilderness,
     For one rough, weather-beaten, veteran body,
     You 'll find ten thousand handsome coxcombs bloody.

     Your houris also have a natural pleasure
       In lopping off your lately married men,
     Before the bridal hours have danced their measure
       And the sad, second moon grows dim again,
     Or dull repentance hath had dreary leisure
       To wish him back a bachelor now and then.
     And thus your houri (it may be) disputes
     Of these brief blossoms the immediate fruits.

     Thus the young khan, with houris in his sight,
       Thought not upon the charms of four young brides,
     But bravely rush'd on his first heavenly night.
       In short, howe'er our better faith derides,
     These black-eyed virgins make the Moslems fight,
       As though there were one heaven and none besides,--
     Whereas, if all be true we hear of heaven
     And hell, there must at least be six or seven.

     So fully flash'd the phantom on his eyes,
       That when the very lance was in his heart,
     He shouted 'Allah!' and saw Paradise
       With all its veil of mystery drawn apart,
     And bright eternity without disguise
       On his soul, like a ceaseless sunrise, dart:--
     With prophets, houris, angels, saints, descried
     In one voluptuous blaze,--and then he died,

     But with a heavenly rapture on his face.
       The good old khan, who long had ceased to see
     Houris, or aught except his florid race
       Who grew like cedars round him gloriously--
     When he beheld his latest hero grace
       The earth, which he became like a fell'd tree,
     Paused for a moment, from the fight, and cast
     A glance on that slain son, his first and last.

     The soldiers, who beheld him drop his point,
       Stopp'd as if once more willing to concede
     Quarter, in case he bade them not 'aroynt!'
       As he before had done. He did not heed
     Their pause nor signs: his heart was out of joint,
       And shook (till now unshaken) like a reed,
     As he look'd down upon his children gone,
     And felt--though done with life--he was alone

     But 't was a transient tremor;--with a spring
       Upon the Russian steel his breast he flung,
     As carelessly as hurls the moth her wing
       Against the light wherein she dies: he clung
     Closer, that all the deadlier they might wring,
       Unto the bayonets which had pierced his young;
     And throwing back a dim look on his sons,
     In one wide wound pour'd forth his soul at once.

     'T is strange enough--the rough, tough soldiers, who
       Spared neither sex nor age in their career
     Of carnage, when this old man was pierced through,
       And lay before them with his children near,
     Touch'd by the heroism of him they slew,
       Were melted for a moment: though no tear
     Flow'd from their bloodshot eyes, all red with strife,
     They honour'd such determined scorn of life.

     But the stone bastion still kept up its fire,
       Where the chief pacha calmly held his post:
     Some twenty times he made the Russ retire,
       And baffled the assaults of all their host;
     At length he condescended to inquire
       If yet the city's rest were won or lost;
     And being told the latter, sent a bey
     To answer Ribas' summons to give way.

     In the mean time, cross-legg'd, with great sang-froid,
       Among the scorching ruins he sat smoking
     Tobacco on a little carpet;--Troy
       Saw nothing like the scene around:--yet looking
     With martial stoicism, nought seem'd to annoy
       His stern philosophy; but gently stroking
     His beard, he puff'd his pipe's ambrosial gales,
     As if he had three lives, as well as tails.

     The town was taken--whether he might yield
       Himself or bastion, little matter'd now:
     His stubborn valour was no future shield.
       Ismail 's no more! The crescent's silver bow
     Sunk, and the crimson cross glared o'er the field,
       But red with no redeeming gore: the glow
     Of burning streets, like moonlight on the water,
     Was imaged back in blood, the sea of slaughter.

     All that the mind would shrink from of excesses;
       All that the body perpetrates of bad;
     All that we read, hear, dream, of man's distresses;
       All that the devil would do if run stark mad;
     All that defies the worst which pen expresses;
       All by which hell is peopled, or as sad
     As hell--mere mortals who their power abuse--
     Was here (as heretofore and since) let loose.

     If here and there some transient trait of pity
       Was shown, and some more noble heart broke through
     Its bloody bond, and saved perhaps some pretty
       Child, or an aged, helpless man or two--
     What 's this in one annihilated city,
       Where thousand loves, and ties, and duties grew?
     Cockneys of London! Muscadins of Paris!
     Just ponder what a pious pastime war is.

     Think how the joys of reading a Gazette
       Are purchased by all agonies and crimes:
     Or if these do not move you, don't forget
       Such doom may be your own in aftertimes.
     Meantime the Taxes, Castlereagh, and Debt,
       Are hints as good as sermons, or as rhymes.
     Read your own hearts and Ireland's present story,
     Then feed her famine fat with Wellesley's glory.

     But still there is unto a patriot nation,
       Which loves so well its country and its king,
     A subject of sublimest exultation--
       Bear it, ye Muses, on your brightest wing!
     Howe'er the mighty locust, Desolation,
       Strip your green fields, and to your harvests cling,
     Gaunt famine never shall approach the throne--
     Though Ireland starve, great George weighs twenty stone.

     But let me put an end unto my theme:
       There was an end of Ismail--hapless town!
     Far flash'd her burning towers o'er Danube's stream,
       And redly ran his blushing waters down.
     The horrid war-whoop and the shriller scream
       Rose still; but fainter were the thunders grown:
     Of forty thousand who had mann'd the wall,
     Some hundreds breathed--the rest were silent all!

     In one thing ne'ertheless 't is fit to praise
       The Russian army upon this occasion,
     A virtue much in fashion now-a-days,
       And therefore worthy of commemoration:
     The topic 's tender, so shall be my phrase--
       Perhaps the season's chill, and their long station
     In winter's depth, or want of rest and victual,
     Had made them chaste;--they ravish'd very little.

     Much did they slay, more plunder, and no less
       Might here and there occur some violation
     In the other line;--but not to such excess
       As when the French, that dissipated nation,
     Take towns by storm: no causes can I guess,
       Except cold weather and commiseration;
     But all the ladies, save some twenty score,
     Were almost as much virgins as before.

     Some odd mistakes, too, happen'd in the dark,
       Which show'd a want of lanterns, or of taste--
     Indeed the smoke was such they scarce could mark
       Their friends from foes,--besides such things from haste
     Occur, though rarely, when there is a spark
       Of light to save the venerably chaste:
     But six old damsels, each of seventy years,
     Were all deflower'd by different grenadiers.

     But on the whole their continence was great;
       So that some disappointment there ensued
     To those who had felt the inconvenient state
       Of 'single blessedness,' and thought it good
     (Since it was not their fault, but only fate,
       To bear these crosses) for each waning prude
     To make a Roman sort of Sabine wedding,
     Without the expense and the suspense of bedding.

     Some voices of the buxom middle-aged
       Were also heard to wonder in the din
     (Widows of forty were these birds long caged)
       'Wherefore the ravishing did not begin!'
     But while the thirst for gore and plunder raged,
       There was small leisure for superfluous sin;
     But whether they escaped or no, lies hid
     In darkness--I can only hope they did.

     Suwarrow now was conqueror--a match
       For Timour or for Zinghis in his trade.
     While mosques and streets, beneath his eyes, like thatch
       Blazed, and the cannon's roar was scarce allay'd,
     With bloody hands he wrote his first despatch;
       And here exactly follows what he said:--
     'Glory to God and to the Empress!' (Powers
     Eternal! such names mingled!) 'Ismail 's ours.'

     Methinks these are the most tremendous words,
       Since 'Mene, Mene, Tekel,' and 'Upharsin,'
     Which hands or pens have ever traced of swords.
       Heaven help me! I 'm but little of a parson:
     What Daniel read was short-hand of the Lord's,
       Severe, sublime; the prophet wrote no farce on
     The fate of nations;--but this Russ so witty
     Could rhyme, like Nero, o'er a burning city.

     He wrote this Polar melody, and set it,
       Duly accompanied by shrieks and groans,
     Which few will sing, I trust, but none forget it--
       For I will teach, if possible, the stones
     To rise against earth's tyrants. Never let it
       Be said that we still truckle unto thrones;--
     But ye--our children's children! think how we
     Show'd what things were before the world was free!

     That hour is not for us, but 't is for you:
       And as, in the great joy of your millennium,
     You hardly will believe such things were true
       As now occur, I thought that I would pen you 'em;
     But may their very memory perish too!-
       Yet if perchance remember'd, still disdain you 'em
     More than you scorn the savages of yore,
     Who painted their bare limbs, but not with gore.

     And when you hear historians talk of thrones,
       And those that sate upon them, let it be
     As we now gaze upon the mammoth's bones,
       'And wonder what old world such things could see,
     Or hieroglyphics on Egyptian stones,
       The pleasant riddles of futurity--
     Guessing at what shall happily be hid,
     As the real purpose of a pyramid.

     Reader! I have kept my word,--at least so far
       As the first Canto promised. You have now
     Had sketches of love, tempest, travel, war--
       All very accurate, you must allow,
     And epic, if plain truth should prove no bar;
       For I have drawn much less with a long bow
     Than my forerunners. Carelessly I sing,
     But Phoebus lends me now and then a string,

     With which I still can harp, and carp, and fiddle.
       What farther hath befallen or may befall
     The hero of this grand poetic riddle,
       I by and by may tell you, if at all:
     But now I choose to break off in the middle,
       Worn out with battering Ismail's stubborn wall,
     While Juan is sent off with the despatch,
     For which all Petersburgh is on the watch.

     This special honour was conferr'd, because
       He had behaved with courage and humanity--
     Which last men like, when they have time to pause
       From their ferocities produced by vanity.
     His little captive gain'd him some applause
       For saving her amidst the wild insanity
     Of carnage,--and I think he was more glad in her
     Safety, than his new order of St. Vladimir.

     The Moslem orphan went with her protector,
       For she was homeless, houseless, helpless; all
     Her friends, like the sad family of Hector,
       Had perish'd in the field or by the wall:
     Her very place of birth was but a spectre
       Of what it had been; there the Muezzin's cal
     To prayer was heard no more!--and Juan wept,
     And made a vow to shield her, which he kept.


[Illustration: Canto 9]




CANTO THE NINTH.

     O, Wellington! (or 'Villainton'--for Fame
       Sounds the heroic syllables both ways;
     France could not even conquer your great name,
       But punn'd it down to this facetious phrase--
     Beating or beaten she will laugh the same),
       You have obtain'd great pensions and much praise:
     Glory like yours should any dare gainsay,
     Humanity would rise, and thunder 'Nay!'

     I don't think that you used Kinnaird quite well
       In Marinet's affair--in fact, 't was shabby,
     And like some other things won't do to tell
       Upon your tomb in Westminster's old abbey.
     Upon the rest 't is not worth while to dwell,
       Such tales being for the tea-hours of some tabby;
     But though your years as man tend fast to zero,
     In fact your grace is still but a young hero.

     Though Britain owes (and pays you too) so much,
       Yet Europe doubtless owes you greatly more:
     You have repair'd Legitimacy's crutch,
       A prop not quite so certain as before:
     The Spanish, and the French, as well as Dutch,
       Have seen, and felt, how strongly you restore;
     And Waterloo has made the world your debtor
     (I wish your bards would sing it rather better).

     You are 'the best of cut-throats:'--do not start;
       The phrase is Shakspeare's, and not misapplied:
     War 's a brain-spattering, windpipe-slitting art,
       Unless her cause by right be sanctified.
     If you have acted once a generous part,
       The world, not the world's masters, will decide,
     And I shall be delighted to learn who,
     Save you and yours, have gain'd by Waterloo?

     I am no flatterer--you 've supp'd full of flattery:
       They say you like it too--'t is no great wonder.
     He whose whole life has been assault and battery,
       At last may get a little tired of thunder;
     And swallowing eulogy much more than satire, he
       May like being praised for every lucky blunder,
     Call'd 'Saviour of the Nations'--not yet saved,
     And 'Europe's Liberator'--still enslaved.

     I 've done. Now go and dine from off the plate
       Presented by the Prince of the Brazils,
     And send the sentinel before your gate
       A slice or two from your luxurious meals:
     He fought, but has not fed so well of late.
       Some hunger, too, they say the people feels:--
     There is no doubt that you deserve your ration,
     But pray give back a little to the nation.

     I don't mean to reflect--a man so great as
       You, my lord duke! is far above reflection:
     The high Roman fashion, too, of Cincinnatus,
       With modern history has but small connection:
     Though as an Irishman you love potatoes,
       You need not take them under your direction;
     And half a million for your Sabine farm
     Is rather dear!--I 'm sure I mean no harm.

     Great men have always scorn'd great recompenses:
       Epaminondas saved his Thebes, and died,
     Not leaving even his funeral expenses:
       George Washington had thanks and nought beside,
     Except the all-cloudless glory which few men's is
       To free his country: Pitt too had his pride,
     And as a high-soul'd minister of state is
     Renown'd for ruining Great Britain gratis.

     Never had mortal man such opportunity,
       Except Napoleon, or abused it more:
     You might have freed fallen Europe from the unity
       Of tyrants, and been blest from shore to shore:
     And now--what is your fame? Shall the Muse tune it ye?
       Now--that the rabble's first vain shouts are o'er?
     Go! hear it in your famish'd country's cries!
     Behold the world! and curse your victories!

     As these new cantos touch on warlike feats,
       To you the unflattering Muse deigns to inscribe
     Truths, that you will not read in the Gazettes,
       But which 't is time to teach the hireling tribe
     Who fatten on their country's gore, and debts,
       Must be recited, and--without a bribe.
     You did great things; but not being great in mind,
     Have left undone the greatest--and mankind.

     Death laughs--Go ponder o'er the skeleton
       With which men image out the unknown thing
     That hides the past world, like to a set sun
       Which still elsewhere may rouse a brighter spring--
     Death laughs at all you weep for:--look upon
       This hourly dread of all! whose threaten'd sting
     Turns life to terror, even though in its sheath:
     Mark how its lipless mouth grins without breath!

     Mark how it laughs and scorns at all you are!
       And yet was what you are: from ear to ear
     It laughs not--there is now no fleshy bar
       So call'd; the Antic long hath ceased to hear,
     But still he smiles; and whether near or far,
       He strips from man that mantle (far more dear
     Than even the tailor's), his incarnate skin,
     White, black, or copper--the dead bones will grin.

     And thus Death laughs,--it is sad merriment,
       But still it is so; and with such example
     Why should not Life be equally content
       With his superior, in a smile to trample
     Upon the nothings which are daily spent
       Like bubbles on an ocean much less ample
     Than the eternal deluge, which devours
     Suns as rays--worlds like atoms--years like hours?

     'To be, or not to be? that is the question,'
       Says Shakspeare, who just now is much in fashion.
     I am neither Alexander nor Hephaestion,
       Nor ever had for abstract fame much passion;
     But would much rather have a sound digestion
       Than Buonaparte's cancer: could I dash on
     Through fifty victories to shame or fame--
     Without a stomach what were a good name?

     'O dura ilia messorum!'--'Oh
       Ye rigid guts of reapers!' I translate
     For the great benefit of those who know
       What indigestion is--that inward fate
     Which makes all Styx through one small liver flow.
       A peasant's sweat is worth his lord's estate:
     Let this one toil for bread--that rack for rent,
     He who sleeps best may be the most content.

     'To be, or not to be?'--Ere I decide,
       I should be glad to know that which is being?
     'T is true we speculate both far and wide,
       And deem, because we see, we are all-seeing:
     For my part, I 'll enlist on neither side,
       Until I see both sides for once agreeing.
     For me, I sometimes think that life is death,
     Rather than life a mere affair of breath.

     'Que scais-je?' was the motto of Montaigne,
       As also of the first academicians:
     That all is dubious which man may attain,
       Was one of their most favourite positions.
     There 's no such thing as certainty, that 's plain
       As any of Mortality's conditions;
     So little do we know what we 're about in
     This world, I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.

     It is a pleasant voyage perhaps to float,
       Like Pyrrho, on a sea of speculation;
     But what if carrying sail capsize the boat?
       Your wise men don't know much of navigation;
     And swimming long in the abyss of thought
       Is apt to tire: a calm and shallow station
     Well nigh the shore, where one stoops down and gathers
     Some pretty shell, is best for moderate bathers.

     'But heaven,' as Cassio says, 'is above all--
       No more of this, then,--let us pray!' We have
     Souls to save, since Eve's slip and Adam's fall,
       Which tumbled all mankind into the grave,
     Besides fish, beasts, and birds. 'The sparrow's fall
       Is special providence,' though how it gave
     Offence, we know not; probably it perch'd
     Upon the tree which Eve so fondly search'd.

     O, ye immortal gods! what is theogony?
       O, thou too, mortal man! what is philanthropy?
     O, world! which was and is, what is cosmogony?
       Some people have accused me of misanthropy;
     And yet I know no more than the mahogany
       That forms this desk, of what they mean; lykanthropy
     I comprehend, for without transformation
     Men become wolves on any slight occasion.

     But I, the mildest, meekest of mankind,
       Like Moses, or Melancthon, who have ne'er
     Done anything exceedingly unkind,--
       And (though I could not now and then forbear
     Following the bent of body or of mind)
       Have always had a tendency to spare,--
     Why do they call me misanthrope? Because
     They hate me, not I them.--and here we 'll pause.

     'T is time we should proceed with our good poem,--
       For I maintain that it is really good,
     Not only in the body but the proem,
       However little both are understood
     Just now,--but by and by the Truth will show 'em
       Herself in her sublimest attitude:
     And till she doth, I fain must be content
     To share her beauty and her banishment.

     Our hero (and, I trust, kind reader, yours)
       Was left upon his way to the chief city
     Of the immortal Peter's polish'd boors
       Who still have shown themselves more brave than witty.
     I know its mighty empire now allures
       Much flattery--even Voltaire's, and that 's a pity.
     For me, I deem an absolute autocrat
     Not a barbarian, but much worse than that.

     And I will war, at least in words (and--should
       My chance so happen--deeds), with all who war
     With Thought;--and of Thought's foes by far most rude,
       Tyrants and sycophants have been and are.
     I know not who may conquer: if I could
       Have such a prescience, it should be no bar
     To this my plain, sworn, downright detestation
     Of every depotism in every nation.

     It is not that I adulate the people:
       Without me, there are demagogues enough,
     And infidels, to pull down every steeple,
       And set up in their stead some proper stuff.
     Whether they may sow scepticism to reap hell,
       As is the Christian dogma rather rough,
     I do not know;--I wish men to be free
     As much from mobs as kings--from you as me.

     The consequence is, being of no party,
       I shall offend all parties: never mind!
     My words, at least, are more sincere and hearty
       Than if I sought to sail before the wind.
     He who has nought to gain can have small art: he
       Who neither wishes to be bound nor bind,
     May still expatiate freely, as will I,
     Nor give my voice to slavery's jackal cry.

     That 's an appropriate simile, that jackal;--
       I 've heard them in the Ephesian ruins howl
     By night, as do that mercenary pack all,
       Power's base purveyors, who for pickings prowl,
     And scent the prey their masters would attack all.
       However, the poor jackals are less foul
     (As being the brave lions' keen providers)
     Than human insects, catering for spiders.

     Raise but an arm! 't will brush their web away,
       And without that, their poison and their claws
     Are useless. Mind, good people! what I say
       (Or rather peoples)--go on without pause!
     The web of these tarantulas each day
       Increases, till you shall make common cause:
     None, save the Spanish fly and Attic bee,
     As yet are strongly stinging to be free.

     Don Juan, who had shone in the late slaughter,
       Was left upon his way with the despatch,
     Where blood was talk'd of as we would of water;
       And carcasses that lay as thick as thatch
     O'er silenced cities, merely served to flatter
       Fair Catherine's pastime--who look'd on the match
     Between these nations as a main of cocks,
     Wherein she liked her own to stand like rocks.

     And there in a kibitka he roll'd on
       (A cursed sort of carriage without springs,
     Which on rough roads leaves scarcely a whole bone),
       Pondering on glory, chivalry, and kings,
     And orders, and on all that he had done--
       And wishing that post-horses had the wings
     Of Pegasus, or at the least post-chaises
     Had feathers, when a traveller on deep ways is.

     At every jolt--and they were many--still
       He turn'd his eyes upon his little charge,
     As if he wish'd that she should fare less ill
       Than he, in these sad highways left at large
     To ruts, and flints, and lovely Nature's skill,
       Who is no paviour, nor admits a barge
     On her canals, where God takes sea and land,
     Fishery and farm, both into his own hand.

     At least he pays no rent, and has best right
       To be the first of what we used to call
     'Gentlemen farmer'--a race worn out quite,
       Since lately there have been no rents at all,
     And 'gentlemen' are in a piteous plight,
       And 'farmers' can't raise Ceres from her fall:
     She fell with Buonaparte--What strange thoughts
     Arise, when we see emperors fall with oats!

     But Juan turn'd his eyes on the sweet child
       Whom he had saved from slaughter--what a trophy
     O! ye who build up monuments, defiled
       With gore, like Nadir Shah, that costive sophy,
     Who, after leaving Hindostan a wild,
       And scarce to the Mogul a cup of coffee
     To soothe his woes withal, was slain, the sinner!
     Because he could no more digest his dinner;--

     O ye! or we! or he! or she! reflect,
       That one life saved, especially if young
     Or pretty, is a thing to recollect
       Far sweeter than the greenest laurels sprung
     From the manure of human clay, though deck'd
       With all the praises ever said or sung:
     Though hymn'd by every harp, unless within
     Your heart joins chorus, Fame is but a din.

     O! ye great authors luminous, voluminous!
       Ye twice ten hundred thousand daily scribes!
     Whose pamphlets, volumes, newspapers, illumine us!
       Whether you 're paid by government in bribes,
     To prove the public debt is not consuming us--
       Or, roughly treading on the 'courtier's kibes'
     With clownish heel, your popular circulation
     Feeds you by printing half the realm's starvation;--

     O, ye great authors!--'Apropos des bottes,'-
       I have forgotten what I meant to say,
     As sometimes have been greater sages' lots;
       'T was something calculated to allay
     All wrath in barracks, palaces, or cots:
       Certes it would have been but thrown away,
     And that 's one comfort for my lost advice,
     Although no doubt it was beyond all price.

     But let it go:--it will one day be found
       With other relics of 'a former world,'
     When this world shall be former, underground,
       Thrown topsy-turvy, twisted, crisp'd, and curl'd,
     Baked, fried, or burnt, turn'd inside-out, or drown'd,
       Like all the worlds before, which have been hurl'd
     First out of, and then back again to chaos,
     The superstratum which will overlay us.

     So Cuvier says;--and then shall come again
       Unto the new creation, rising out
     From our old crash, some mystic, ancient strain
       Of things destroy'd and left in airy doubt:
     Like to the notions we now entertain
       Of Titans, giants, fellows of about
     Some hundred feet in height, not to say miles,
     And mammoths, and your winged crocodiles.

     Think if then George the Fourth should be dug up!
       How the new worldlings of the then new East
     Will wonder where such animals could sup!
       (For they themselves will be but of the least:
     Even worlds miscarry, when too oft they pup,
       And every new creation hath decreased
     In size, from overworking the material--
     Men are but maggots of some huge Earth's burial.)

     How will--to these young people, just thrust out
       From some fresh Paradise, and set to plough,
     And dig, and sweat, and turn themselves about,
       And plant, and reap, and spin, and grind, and sow,
     Till all the arts at length are brought about,
       Especially of war and taxing,--how,
     I say, will these great relics, when they see 'em,
     Look like the monsters of a new museum?

     But I am apt to grow too metaphysical:
       'The time is out of joint,'--and so am I;
     I quite forget this poem 's merely quizzical,
       And deviate into matters rather dry.
     I ne'er decide what I shall say, and this I cal
       Much too poetical: men should know why
     They write, and for what end; but, note or text,
     I never know the word which will come next.

     So on I ramble, now and then narrating,
       Now pondering:--it is time we should narrate.
     I left Don Juan with his horses baiting--
       Now we 'll get o'er the ground at a great rate.
     I shall not be particular in stating
       His journey, we 've so many tours of late:
     Suppose him then at Petersburgh; suppose
     That pleasant capital of painted snows;

     Suppose him in a handsome uniform,--
       A scarlet coat, black facings, a long plume,
     Waving, like sails new shiver'd in a storm,
       Over a cock'd hat in a crowded room,
     And brilliant breeches, bright as a Cairn Gorme,
       Of yellow casimere we may presume,
     White stocking drawn uncurdled as new milk
     O'er limbs whose symmetry set off the silk;

     Suppose him sword by side, and hat in hand,
       Made up by youth, fame, and an army tailor--
     That great enchanter, at whose rod's command
       Beauty springs forth, and Nature's self turns paler,
     Seeing how Art can make her work more grand
       (When she don't pin men's limbs in like a gaoler),--
     Behold him placed as if upon a pillar! He
     Seems Love turn'd a lieutenant of artillery:--

     His bandage slipp'd down into a cravat;
       His wings subdued to epaulettes; his quiver
     Shrunk to a scabbard, with his arrows at
       His side as a small sword, but sharp as ever;
     His bow converted into a cock'd hat;
       But still so like, that Psyche were more clever
     Than some wives (who make blunders no less stupid),
     If she had not mistaken him for Cupid.

     The courtiers stared, the ladies whisper'd, and
       The empress smiled: the reigning favourite frown'd--
     I quite forget which of them was in hand
       Just then; as they are rather numerous found,
     Who took by turns that difficult command
       Since first her majesty was singly crown'd:
     But they were mostly nervous six-foot fellows,
     All fit to make a Patagonian jealous.

     Juan was none of these, but slight and slim,
       Blushing and beardless; and yet ne'ertheless
     There was a something in his turn of limb,
       And still more in his eye, which seem'd to express,
     That though he look'd one of the seraphim,
       There lurk'd a man beneath the spirit's dress.
     Besides, the empress sometimes liked a boy,
     And had just buried the fair-faced Lanskoi.

     No wonder then that Yermoloff, or Momonoff,
       Or Scherbatoff, or any other off
     Or on, might dread her majesty had not room enough
       Within her bosom (which was not too tough)
     For a new flame; a thought to cast of gloom enough
       Along the aspect, whether smooth or rough,
     Of him who, in the language of his station,
     Then held that 'high official situation.'

     O, gentle ladies! should you seek to know
       The import of this diplomatic phrase,
     Bid Ireland's Londonderry's Marquess show
       His parts of speech; and in the strange displays
     Of that odd string of words, all in a row,
       Which none divine, and every one obeys,
     Perhaps you may pick out some queer no meaning,
     Of that weak wordy harvest the sole gleaning.

     I think I can explain myself without
       That sad inexplicable beast of prey--
     That Sphinx, whose words would ever be a doubt,
       Did not his deeds unriddle them each day--
     That monstrous hieroglyphic--that long spout
       Of blood and water, leaden Castlereagh!
     And here I must an anecdote relate,
     But luckily of no great length or weight.

     An English lady ask'd of an Italian,
       What were the actual and official duties
     Of the strange thing some women set a value on,
       Which hovers oft about some married beauties,
     Called 'Cavalier servente?'--a Pygmalion
       Whose statues warm (I fear, alas! too true 't is)
     Beneath his art. The dame, press'd to disclose them,
     Said--'Lady, I beseech you to suppose them.'

     And thus I supplicate your supposition,
       And mildest, matron-like interpretation,
     Of the imperial favourite's condition.
       'T was a high place, the highest in the nation
     In fact, if not in rank; and the suspicion
       Of any one's attaining to his station,
     No doubt gave pain, where each new pair of shoulders,
     If rather broad, made stocks rise and their holders.

     Juan, I said, was a most beauteous boy,
       And had retain'd his boyish look beyond
     The usual hirsute seasons which destroy,
       With beards and whiskers, and the like, the fond
     Parisian aspect which upset old Troy
       And founded Doctors' Commons:--I have conn'd
     The history of divorces, which, though chequer'd,
     Calls Ilion's the first damages on record.

     And Catherine, who loved all things (save her lord,
       Who was gone to his place), and pass'd for much
     Admiring those (by dainty dames abhorr'd)
       Gigantic gentlemen, yet had a touch
     Of sentiment; and he she most adored
       Was the lamented Lanskoi, who was such
     A lover as had cost her many a tear,
     And yet but made a middling grenadier.

     O thou 'teterrima causa' of all 'belli'-
       Thou gate of life and death--thou nondescript!
     Whence is our exit and our entrance,--well I
       May pause in pondering how all souls are dipt
     In thy perennial fountain:--how man fell I
       Know not, since knowledge saw her branches stript
     Of her first fruit; but how he falls and rises
     Since, thou hast settled beyond all surmises.

     Some call thee 'the worst cause of war,' but I
       Maintain thou art the best: for after all
     From thee we come, to thee we go, and why
       To get at thee not batter down a wall,
     Or waste a world? since no one can deny
       Thou dost replenish worlds both great and small:
     With, or without thee, all things at a stand
     Are, or would be, thou sea of life's dry land!

     Catherine, who was the grand epitome
       Of that great cause of war, or peace, or what
     You please (it causes all the things which be,
       So you may take your choice of this or that)--
     Catherine, I say, was very glad to see
       The handsome herald, on whose plumage sat
     Victory; and pausing as she saw him kneel
     With his despatch, forgot to break the seal.

     Then recollecting the whole empress, nor
       forgetting quite the woman (which composed
     At least three parts of this great whole), she tore
       The letter open with an air which posed
     The court, that watch'd each look her visage wore,
       Until a royal smile at length disclosed
     Fair weather for the day. Though rather spacious,
     Her face was noble, her eyes fine, mouth gracious.

     Great joy was hers, or rather joys: the first
       Was a ta'en city, thirty thousand slain.
     Glory and triumph o'er her aspect burst,
       As an East Indian sunrise on the main.
     These quench'd a moment her ambition's thirst--
       So Arab deserts drink in summer's rain:
     In vain!--As fall the dews on quenchless sands,
     Blood only serves to wash Ambition's hands!

     Her next amusement was more fanciful;
       She smiled at mad Suwarrow's rhymes, who threw
     Into a Russian couplet rather dull
       The whole gazette of thousands whom he slew.
     Her third was feminine enough to annul
       The shudder which runs naturally through
     Our veins, when things call'd sovereigns think it best
     To kill, and generals turn it into jest.

     The two first feelings ran their course complete,
       And lighted first her eye, and then her mouth:
     The whole court look'd immediately most sweet,
       Like flowers well water'd after a long drouth.
     But when on the lieutenant at her feet
       Her majesty, who liked to gaze on youth
     Almost as much as on a new despatch,
     Glanced mildly, all the world was on the watch.

     Though somewhat large, exuberant, and truculent,
       When wroth--while pleased, she was as fine a figure
     As those who like things rosy, ripe, and succulent,
       Would wish to look on, while they are in vigour.
     She could repay each amatory look you lent
       With interest, and in turn was wont with rigour
     To exact of Cupid's bills the full amount
     At sight, nor would permit you to discount.

     With her the latter, though at times convenient,
       Was not so necessary; for they tell
     That she was handsome, and though fierce look'd lenient,
       And always used her favourites too well.
     If once beyond her boudoir's precincts in ye went,
       Your 'fortune' was in a fair way 'to swell
     A man' (as Giles says); for though she would widow all
     Nations, she liked man as an individual.

     What a strange thing is man? and what a stranger
       Is woman! What a whirlwind is her head,
     And what a whirlpool full of depth and danger
       Is all the rest about her! Whether wed
     Or widow, maid or mother, she can change her
       Mind like the wind: whatever she has said
     Or done, is light to what she 'll say or do;--
     The oldest thing on record, and yet new!

     O Catherine! (for of all interjections,
       To thee both oh! and ah! belong of right
     In love and war) how odd are the connections
       Of human thoughts, which jostle in their flight!
     Just now yours were cut out in different sections:
       First Ismail's capture caught your fancy quite;
     Next of new knights, the fresh and glorious batch;
     And thirdly he who brought you the despatch!

     Shakspeare talks of 'the herald Mercury
       New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;'
     And some such visions cross'd her majesty,
       While her young herald knelt before her still.
     'T is very true the hill seem'd rather high,
       For a lieutenant to climb up; but skill
     Smooth'd even the Simplon's steep, and by God's blessing
     With youth and health all kisses are 'heaven-kissing.'

     Her majesty look'd down, the youth look'd up--
       And so they fell in love;--she with his face,
     His grace, his God-knows-what: for Cupid's cup
       With the first draught intoxicates apace,
     A quintessential laudanum or 'black drop,'
       Which makes one drunk at once, without the base
     Expedient of full bumpers; for the eye
     In love drinks all life's fountains (save tears) dry.

     He, on the other hand, if not in love,
       Fell into that no less imperious passion,
     Self-love--which, when some sort of thing above
       Ourselves, a singer, dancer, much in fashion,
     Or duchess, princess, empress, 'deigns to prove'
       ('T is Pope's phrase) a great longing, though a rash one,
     For one especial person out of many,
     Makes us believe ourselves as good as any.

     Besides, he was of that delighted age
       Which makes all female ages equal--when
     We don't much care with whom we may engage,
       As bold as Daniel in the lion's den,
     So that we can our native sun assuage
       In the next ocean, which may flow just then,
     To make a twilight in, just as Sol's heat is
     Quench'd in the lap of the salt sea, or Thetis.

     And Catherine (we must say thus much for Catherine),
       Though bold and bloody, was the kind of thing
     Whose temporary passion was quite flattering,
       Because each lover look'd a sort of king,
     Made up upon an amatory pattern,
       A royal husband in all save the ring--
     Which, being the damn'dest part of matrimony,
     Seem'd taking out the sting to leave the honey.

     And when you add to this, her womanhood
       In its meridian, her blue eyes or gray
     (The last, if they have soul, are quite as good,
       Or better, as the best examples say:
     Napoleon's, Mary's (queen of Scotland), should
       Lend to that colour a transcendent ray;
     And Pallas also sanctions the same hue,
     Too wise to look through optics black or blue)--

     Her sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,
       Her plumpness, her imperial condescension,
     Her preference of a boy to men much bigger
       (Fellows whom Messalina's self would pension),
     Her prime of life, just now in juicy vigour,
       With other extras, which we need not mention,--
     All these, or any one of these, explain
     Enough to make a stripling very vain.

     And that 's enough, for love is vanity,
       Selfish in its beginning as its end,
     Except where 't is a mere insanity,
       A maddening spirit which would strive to blend
     Itself with beauty's frail inanity,
       On which the passion's self seems to depend:
     And hence some heathenish philosophers
     Make love the main spring of the universe.

     Besides Platonic love, besides the love
       Of God, the love of sentiment, the loving
     Of faithful pairs (I needs must rhyme with dove,
       That good old steam-boat which keeps verses moving
     'Gainst reason--Reason ne'er was hand-and-glove
       With rhyme, but always leant less to improving
     The sound than sense)--beside all these pretences
     To love, there are those things which words name senses;

     Those movements, those improvements in our bodies
       Which make all bodies anxious to get out
     Of their own sand-pits, to mix with a goddess,
       For such all women are at first no doubt.
     How beautiful that moment! and how odd is
       That fever which precedes the languid rout
     Of our sensations! What a curious way
     The whole thing is of clothing souls in clay!

     The noblest kind of love is love Platonical,
       To end or to begin with; the next grand
     Is that which may be christen'd love canonical,
       Because the clergy take the thing in hand;
     The third sort to be noted in our chronicle
       As flourishing in every Christian land,
     Is when chaste matrons to their other ties
     Add what may be call'd marriage in disguise.

     Well, we won't analyse--our story must
       Tell for itself: the sovereign was smitten,
     Juan much flatter'd by her love, or lust;--
       I cannot stop to alter words once written,
     And the two are so mix'd with human dust,
       That he who names one, both perchance may hit on:
     But in such matters Russia's mighty empress
     Behaved no better than a common sempstress.

     The whole court melted into one wide whisper,
       And all lips were applied unto all ears!
     The elder ladies' wrinkles curl'd much crisper
       As they beheld; the younger cast some leers
     On one another, and each lovely lisper
       Smiled as she talk'd the matter o'er; but tears
     Of rivalship rose in each clouded eye
     Of all the standing army who stood by.

     All the ambassadors of all the powers
       Enquired, Who was this very new young man,
     Who promised to be great in some few hours?
       Which is full soon--though life is but a span.
     Already they beheld the silver showers
       Of rubles rain, as fast as specie can,
     Upon his cabinet, besides the presents
     Of several ribands, and some thousand peasants.

     Catherine was generous,--all such ladies are:
       Love, that great opener of the heart and all
     The ways that lead there, be they near or far,
       Above, below, by turnpikes great or small,--
     Love (though she had a cursed taste for war,
       And was not the best wife, unless we call
     Such Clytemnestra, though perhaps 't is better
     That one should die, than two drag on the fetter)--

     Love had made Catherine make each lover's fortune,
       Unlike our own half-chaste Elizabeth,
     Whose avarice all disbursements did importune,
       If history, the grand liar, ever saith
     The truth; and though grief her old age might shorten,
       Because she put a favourite to death,
     Her vile, ambiguous method of flirtation,
     And stinginess, disgrace her sex and station.

     But when the levee rose, and all was bustle
       In the dissolving circle, all the nations'
     Ambassadors began as 't were to hustle
       Round the young man with their congratulations.
     Also the softer silks were heard to rustle
       Of gentle dames, among whose recreations
     It is to speculate on handsome faces,
     Especially when such lead to high places.

     Juan, who found himself, he knew not how,
       A general object of attention, made
     His answers with a very graceful bow,
       As if born for the ministerial trade.
     Though modest, on his unembarrass'd brow
       Nature had written 'gentleman.' He said
     Little, but to the purpose; and his manner
     Flung hovering graces o'er him like a banner.

     An order from her majesty consign'd
       Our young lieutenant to the genial care
     Of those in office: all the world look'd kind
       (As it will look sometimes with the first stare,
     Which youth would not act ill to keep in mind),
       As also did Miss Protasoff then there,
     Named from her mystic office 'l'Eprouveuse,'
     A term inexplicable to the Muse.

     With her then, as in humble duty bound,
       Juan retired,--and so will I, until
     My Pegasus shall tire of touching ground.
       We have just lit on a 'heaven-kissing hill,'
     So lofty that I feel my brain turn round,
       And all my fancies whirling like a mill;
     Which is a signal to my nerves and brain,
     To take a quiet ride in some green Lane.


[Illustration: Canto 10]




CANTO THE TENTH.

     When Newton saw an apple fall, he found
       In that slight startle from his contemplation--
     'T is said (for I 'll not answer above ground
       For any sage's creed or calculation)--
     A mode of proving that the earth turn'd round
       In a most natural whirl, called 'gravitation;'
     And this is the sole mortal who could grapple,
     Since Adam, with a fall or with an apple.

     Man fell with apples, and with apples rose,
       If this be true; for we must deem the mode
     In which Sir Isaac Newton could disclose
       Through the then unpaved stars the turnpike road,
     A thing to counterbalance human woes:
       For ever since immortal man hath glow'd
     With all kinds of mechanics, and full soon
     Steam-engines will conduct him to the moon.

     And wherefore this exordium?--Why, just now,
       In taking up this paltry sheet of paper,
     My bosom underwent a glorious glow,
       And my internal spirit cut a caper:
     And though so much inferior, as I know,
       To those who, by the dint of glass and vapour,
     Discover stars and sail in the wind's eye,
     I wish to do as much by poesy.

     In the wind's eye I have sail'd, and sail; but for
       The stars, I own my telescope is dim:
     But at least I have shunn'd the common shore,
       And leaving land far out of sight, would skim
     The ocean of eternity: the roar
       Of breakers has not daunted my slight, trim,
     But still sea-worthy skiff; and she may float
     Where ships have founder'd, as doth many a boat.

     We left our hero, Juan, in the bloom
       Of favouritism, but not yet in the blush;
     And far be it from my Muses to presume
       (For I have more than one Muse at a push)
     To follow him beyond the drawing-room:
       It is enough that Fortune found him flush
     Of youth, and vigour, beauty, and those things
     Which for an instant clip enjoyment's wings.

     But soon they grow again and leave their nest.
       'Oh!' saith the Psalmist, 'that I had a dove's
     Pinions to flee away, and be at rest!'
       And who that recollects young years and loves,--
     Though hoary now, and with a withering breast,
       And palsied fancy, which no longer roves
     Beyond its dimm'd eye's sphere,--but would much rather
     Sigh like his son, than cough like his grandfather?

     But sighs subside, and tears (even widows') shrink,
       Like Arno in the summer, to a shallow,
     So narrow as to shame their wintry brink,
       Which threatens inundations deep and yellow!
     Such difference doth a few months make. You 'd think
       Grief a rich field which never would lie fallow;
     No more it doth, its ploughs but change their boys,
     Who furrow some new soil to sow for joys.

     But coughs will come when sighs depart--and now
       And then before sighs cease; for oft the one
     Will bring the other, ere the lake-like brow
       Is ruffled by a wrinkle, or the sun
     Of life reach'd ten o'clock: and while a glow,
       Hectic and brief as summer's day nigh done,
     O'erspreads the cheek which seems too pure for clay,
     Thousands blaze, love, hope, die,--how happy they!

     But Juan was not meant to die so soon.
       We left him in the focus of such glory
     As may be won by favour of the moon
       Or ladies' fancies--rather transitory
     Perhaps; but who would scorn the month of June,
       Because December, with his breath so hoary,
     Must come? Much rather should he court the ray,
     To hoard up warmth against a wintry day.

     Besides, he had some qualities which fix
       Middle-aged ladies even more than young:
     The former know what 's what; while new-fledged chicks
       Know little more of love than what is sung
     In rhymes, or dreamt (for fancy will play tricks)
       In visions of those skies from whence Love sprung.
     Some reckon women by their suns or years,
     I rather think the moon should date the dears.

     And why? because she 's changeable and chaste.
       I know no other reason, whatsoe'er
     Suspicious people, who find fault in haste,
       May choose to tax me with; which is not fair,
     Nor flattering to 'their temper or their taste,'
       As my friend Jeffrey writes with such an air:
     However, I forgive him, and I trust
     He will forgive himself;--if not, I must.

     Old enemies who have become new friends
       Should so continue--'t is a point of honour;
     And I know nothing which could make amends
       For a return to hatred: I would shun her
     Like garlic, howsoever she extends
       Her hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her.
     Old flames, new wives, become our bitterest foes--
     Converted foes should scorn to join with those.

     This were the worst desertion:--renegadoes,
       Even shuffling Southey, that incarnate lie,
     Would scarcely join again the 'reformadoes,'
       Whom he forsook to fill the laureate's sty:
     And honest men from Iceland to Barbadoes,
       Whether in Caledon or Italy,
     Should not veer round with every breath, nor seize
     To pain, the moment when you cease to please.

     The lawyer and the critic but behold
       The baser sides of literature and life,
     And nought remains unseen, but much untold,
       By those who scour those double vales of strife.
     While common men grow ignorantly old,
       The lawyer's brief is like the surgeon's knife,
     Dissecting the whole inside of a question,
     And with it all the process of digestion.

     A legal broom 's a moral chimney-sweeper,
       And that 's the reason he himself 's so dirty;
     The endless soot bestows a tint far deeper
       Than can be hid by altering his shirt; he
     Retains the sable stains of the dark creeper,
       At least some twenty-nine do out of thirty,
     In all their habits;--not so you, I own;
     As Caesar wore his robe you wear your gown.

     And all our little feuds, at least all mine,
       Dear Jefferson, once my most redoubted foe
     (As far as rhyme and criticism combine
       To make such puppets of us things below),
     Are over: Here 's a health to 'Auld Lang Syne!'
       I do not know you, and may never know
     Your face--but you have acted on the whole
     Most nobly, and I own it from my soul.

     And when I use the phrase of 'Auld Lang Syne!'
       'T is not address'd to you--the more 's the pity
     For me, for I would rather take my wine
       With you, than aught (save Scott) in your proud city.
     But somehow,--it may seem a schoolboy's whine,
       And yet I seek not to be grand nor witty,
     But I am half a Scot by birth, and bred
     A whole one, and my heart flies to my head,--

     As 'Auld Lang Syne' brings Scotland, one and all,
       Scotch plaids, Scotch snoods, the blue hills, and clear streams,
     The Dee, the Don, Balgounie's brig's black wall,
       All my boy feelings, all my gentler dreams
     Of what I then dreamt, clothed in their own pall,
       Like Banquo's offspring;--floating past me seems
     My childhood in this childishness of mine:
     I care not--'t is a glimpse of 'Auld Lang Syne.'

     And though, as you remember, in a fit
       Of wrath and rhyme, when juvenile and curly,
     I rail'd at Scots to show my wrath and wit,
       Which must be own'd was sensitive and surly,
     Yet 't is in vain such sallies to permit,
       They cannot quench young feelings fresh and early:
     I 'scotch'd not kill'd' the Scotchman in my blood,
     And love the land of 'mountain and of flood.'

     Don Juan, who was real, or ideal,--
       For both are much the same, since what men think
     Exists when the once thinkers are less real
       Than what they thought, for mind can never sink,
     And 'gainst the body makes a strong appeal;
       And yet 't is very puzzling on the brink
     Of what is call'd eternity, to stare,
     And know no more of what is here, than there;--

     Don Juan grew a very polish'd Russian--
       How we won't mention, why we need not say:
     Few youthful minds can stand the strong concussion
       Of any slight temptation in their way;
     But his just now were spread as is a cushion
       Smooth'd for a monarch's seat of honour; gay
     Damsels, and dances, revels, ready money,
     Made ice seem paradise, and winter sunny.

     The favour of the empress was agreeable;
       And though the duty wax'd a little hard,
     Young people at his time of life should be able
       To come off handsomely in that regard.
     He was now growing up like a green tree, able
       For love, war, or ambition, which reward
     Their luckier votaries, till old age's tedium
     Make some prefer the circulating medium.

     About this time, as might have been anticipated,
       Seduced by youth and dangerous examples,
     Don Juan grew, I fear, a little dissipated;
       Which is a sad thing, and not only tramples
     On our fresh feelings, but--as being participated
       With all kinds of incorrigible samples
     Of frail humanity--must make us selfish,
     And shut our souls up in us like a shell-fish.

     This we pass over. We will also pass
       The usual progress of intrigues between
     Unequal matches, such as are, alas!
       A young lieutenant's with a not old queen,
     But one who is not so youthful as she was
       In all the royalty of sweet seventeen.
     Sovereigns may sway materials, but not matter,

     And Death, the sovereign's sovereign, though the great
       Gracchus of all mortality, who levels
     With his Agrarian laws the high estate
       Of him who feasts, and fights, and roars, and revels,
     To one small grass-grown patch (which must await
       Corruption for its crop) with the poor devils
     Who never had a foot of land till now,--
     Death 's a reformer, all men must allow.

     He lived (not Death, but Juan) in a hurry
       Of waste, and haste, and glare, and gloss, and glitter,
     In this gay clime of bear-skins black and furry--
       Which (though I hate to say a thing that 's bitter)
     Peep out sometimes, when things are in a flurry,
       Through all the 'purple and fine linen,' fitter
     For Babylon's than Russia's royal harlot--
     And neutralize her outward show of scarlet.

     And this same state we won't describe: we would
       Perhaps from hearsay, or from recollection;
     But getting nigh grim Dante's 'obscure wood,'
       That horrid equinox, that hateful section
     Of human years, that half-way house, that rude
       Hut, whence wise travellers drive with circumspection
     Life's sad post-horses o'er the dreary frontier
     Of age, and looking back to youth, give one tear;--

     I won't describe,--that is, if I can help
       Description; and I won't reflect,--that is,
     If I can stave off thought, which--as a whelp
       Clings to its teat--sticks to me through the abyss
     Of this odd labyrinth; or as the kelp
       Holds by the rock; or as a lover's kiss
     Drains its first draught of lips:--but, as I said,
     I won't philosophise, and will be read.

     Juan, instead of courting courts, was courted,--
       A thing which happens rarely: this he owed
     Much to his youth, and much to his reported
       Valour; much also to the blood he show'd,
     Like a race-horse; much to each dress he sported,
       Which set the beauty off in which he glow'd,
     As purple clouds befringe the sun; but most
     He owed to an old woman and his post.

     He wrote to Spain:--and all his near relations,
       Perceiving fie was in a handsome way
     Of getting on himself, and finding stations
       For cousins also, answer'd the same day.
     Several prepared themselves for emigrations;
       And eating ices, were o'erheard to say,
     That with the addition of a slight pelisse,
     Madrid's and Moscow's climes were of a piece.

     His mother, Donna Inez, finding, too,
       That in the lieu of drawing on his banker,
     Where his assets were waxing rather few,
       He had brought his spending to a handsome anchor,--
     Replied, 'that she was glad to see him through
       Those pleasures after which wild youth will hanker;
     As the sole sign of man's being in his senses
     Is, learning to reduce his past expenses.

     'She also recommended him to God,
       And no less to God's Son, as well as Mother,
     Warn'd him against Greek worship, which looks odd
       In Catholic eyes; but told him, too, to smother
     Outward dislike, which don't look well abroad;
       Inform'd him that he had a little brother
     Born in a second wedlock; and above
     All, praised the empress's maternal love.

     'She could not too much give her approbation
       Unto an empress, who preferr'd young men
     Whose age, and what was better still, whose nation
       And climate, stopp'd all scandal (now and then):--
     At home it might have given her some vexation;
       But where thermometers sunk down to ten,
     Or five, or one, or zero, she could never
     Believe that virtue thaw'd before the river.'

     O for a forty-parson power to chant
       Thy praise, Hypocrisy! Oh for a hymn
     Loud as the virtues thou dost loudly vaunt,
       Not practise! Oh for trumps of cherubim!
     Or the ear-trumpet of my good old aunt,
       Who, though her spectacles at last grew dim,
     Drew quiet consolation through its hint,
     When she no more could read the pious print.

     She was no hypocrite at least, poor soul,
       But went to heaven in as sincere a way
     As any body on the elected roll,
       Which portions out upon the judgment day
     Heaven's freeholds, in a sort of doomsday scroll,
       Such as the conqueror William did repay
     His knights with, lotting others' properties
     Into some sixty thousand new knights' fees.

     I can't complain, whose ancestors are there,
       Erneis, Radulphus--eight-and-forty manors
     (If that my memory doth not greatly err)
       Were their reward for following Billy's banners:
     And though I can't help thinking 't was scarce fair
       To strip the Saxons of their hydes, like tanners;
     Yet as they founded churches with the produce,
     You 'll deem, no doubt, they put it to a good use.

     The gentle Juan flourish'd, though at times
       He felt like other plants called sensitive,
     Which shrink from touch, as monarchs do from rhymes,
       Save such as Southey can afford to give.
     Perhaps he long'd in bitter frosts for climes
       In which the Neva's ice would cease to live
     Before May-day: perhaps, despite his duty,
     In royalty's vast arms he sigh d for beauty:

     Perhaps--but, sans perhaps, we need not seek
       For causes young or old: the canker-worm
     Will feed upon the fairest, freshest cheek,
       As well as further drain the wither'd form:
     Care, like a housekeeper, brings every week
       His bills in, and however we may storm,
     They must be paid: though six days smoothly run,
     The seventh will bring blue devils or a dun.

     I don't know how it was, but he grew sick:
       The empress was alarm'd, and her physician
     (The same who physick'd Peter) found the tick
       Of his fierce pulse betoken a condition
     Which augur'd of the dead, however quick
       Itself, and show'd a feverish disposition;
     At which the whole court was extremely troubled,
     The sovereign shock'd, and all his medicines doubled.

     Low were the whispers, manifold the rumours:
       Some said he had been poison'd by Potemkin;
     Others talk'd learnedly of certain tumours,
       Exhaustion, or disorders of the same kin;
     Some said 't was a concoction of the humours,
       Which with the blood too readily will claim kin;
     Others again were ready to maintain,
     ''T was only the fatigue of last campaign.'

     But here is one prescription out of many:
       'Sodae sulphat. 3vj. 3fs. Mannae optim.
     Aq. fervent. f. 3ifs. 3ij. tinct. Sennae
       Haustus' (And here the surgeon came and cupp'd him)
     'Rx Pulv Com gr. iij. Ipecacuanhae'
       (With more beside if Juan had not stopp'd 'em).
     'Bolus Potassae Sulphuret. sumendus,
     Et haustus ter in die capiendus.'

     This is the way physicians mend or end us,
       Secundum artem: but although we sneer
     In health--when ill, we call them to attend us,
       Without the least propensity to jeer:
     While that 'hiatus maxime deflendus'
       To be fill'd up by spade or mattock's near,
     Instead of gliding graciously down Lethe,
     We tease mild Baillie, or soft Abernethy.

     Juan demurr'd at this first notice to
       Quit; and though death had threaten'd an ejection,
     His youth and constitution bore him through,
       And sent the doctors in a new direction.
     But still his state was delicate: the hue
       Of health but flicker'd with a faint reflection
     Along his wasted cheek, and seem'd to gravel
     The faculty--who said that he must travel.

     The climate was too cold, they said, for him,
       Meridian-born, to bloom in. This opinion
     Made the chaste Catherine look a little grim,
       Who did not like at first to lose her minion:
     But when she saw his dazzling eye wax dim,
       And drooping like an eagle's with clipt pinion,
     She then resolved to send him on a mission,
     But in a style becoming his condition.

     There was just then a kind of a discussion,
       A sort of treaty or negotiation
     Between the British cabinet and Russian,
       Maintain'd with all the due prevarication
     With which great states such things are apt to push on;
       Something about the Baltic's navigation,
     Hides, train-oil, tallow, and the rights of Thetis,
     Which Britons deem their 'uti possidetis.'

     So Catherine, who had a handsome way
       Of fitting out her favourites, conferr'd
     This secret charge on Juan, to display
       At once her royal splendour, and reward
     His services. He kiss'd hands the next day,
       Received instructions how to play his card,
     Was laden with all kinds of gifts and honours,
     Which show'd what great discernment was the donor's.

     But she was lucky, and luck 's all. Your queens
       Are generally prosperous in reigning;
     Which puzzles us to know what Fortune means.
       But to continue: though her years were waning
     Her climacteric teased her like her teens;
       And though her dignity brook'd no complaining,
     So much did Juan's setting off distress her,
     She could not find at first a fit successor.

     But time, the comforter, will come at last;
       And four-and-twenty hours, and twice that number
     Of candidates requesting to be placed,
       Made Catherine taste next night a quiet slumber:--
     Not that she meant to fix again in haste,
       Nor did she find the quantity encumber,
     But always choosing with deliberation,
     Kept the place open for their emulation.

     While this high post of honour 's in abeyance,
       For one or two days, reader, we request
     You 'll mount with our young hero the conveyance
       Which wafted him from Petersburgh: the best
     Barouche, which had the glory to display once
       The fair czarina's autocratic crest,
     When, a new lphigene, she went to Tauris,
     Was given to her favourite, and now bore his.

     A bull-dog, and a bullfinch, and an ermine,
       All private favourites of Don Juan;--for
     (Let deeper sages the true cause determine)
       He had a kind of inclination, or
     Weakness, for what most people deem mere vermin,
       Live animals: an old maid of threescore
     For cats and birds more penchant ne'er display'd,
     Although he was not old, nor even a maid;--

     The animals aforesaid occupied
       Their station: there were valets, secretaries,
     In other vehicles; but at his side
       Sat little Leila, who survived the parries
     He made 'gainst Cossacque sabres, in the wide
       Slaughter of Ismail. Though my wild Muse varies
     Her note, she don't forget the infant girl
     Whom he preserved, a pure and living pearl

     Poor little thing! She was as fair as docile,
       And with that gentle, serious character,
     As rare in living beings as a fossile
       Man, 'midst thy mouldy mammoths, 'grand Cuvier!'
     Ill fitted was her ignorance to jostle
       With this o'erwhelming world, where all must err:
     But she was yet but ten years old, and therefore
     Was tranquil, though she knew not why or wherefore.

     Don Juan loved her, and she loved him, as
       Nor brother, father, sister, daughter love.
     I cannot tell exactly what it was;
       He was not yet quite old enough to prove
     Parental feelings, and the other class,
       Call'd brotherly affection, could not move
     His bosom,--for he never had a sister:
     Ah! if he had, how much he would have miss'd her!

     And still less was it sensual; for besides
       That he was not an ancient debauchee
     (Who like sour fruit, to stir their veins' salt tides,
       As acids rouse a dormant alkali),
     Although ('t will happen as our planet guides)
       His youth was not the chastest that might be,
     There was the purest Platonism at bottom
     Of all his feelings--only he forgot 'em.

     Just now there was no peril of temptation;
       He loved the infant orphan he had saved,
     As patriots (now and then) may love a nation;
       His pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved
     Owing to him;--as also her salvation
       Through his means and the church's might be paved.
     But one thing 's odd, which here must be inserted,
     The little Turk refused to be converted.

     'T was strange enough she should retain the impression
       Through such a scene of change, and dread, and slaughter;
     But though three bishops told her the transgression,
       She show'd a great dislike to holy water:
     She also had no passion for confession;
       Perhaps she had nothing to confess:--no matter,
     Whate'er the cause, the church made little of it--
     She still held out that Mahomet was a prophet.

     In fact, the only Christian she could bear
       Was Juan; whom she seem'd to have selected
     In place of what her home and friends once were.
       He naturally loved what he protected:
     And thus they form'd a rather curious pair,
       A guardian green in years, a ward connected
     In neither clime, time, blood, with her defender;
     And yet this want of ties made theirs more tender.

     They journey'd on through Poland and through Warsaw,
       Famous for mines of salt and yokes of iron:
     Through Courland also, which that famous farce saw
       Which gave her dukes the graceless name of 'Biron.'
     'T is the same landscape which the modern Mars saw,
       Who march'd to Moscow, led by Fame, the siren!
     To lose by one month's frost some twenty years
     Of conquest, and his guard of grenadiers.

     Let this not seem an anti-climax:--'Oh!
       My guard! my old guard exclaim'd!' exclaim'd that god of day.
     Think of the Thunderer's falling down below
       Carotid-artery-cutting Castlereagh!
     Alas, that glory should be chill'd by snow!
       But should we wish to warm us on our way
     Through Poland, there is Kosciusko's name
     Might scatter fire through ice, like Hecla's flame.

     From Poland they came on through Prussia Proper,
       And Konigsberg the capital, whose vaunt,
     Besides some veins of iron, lead, or copper,
       Has lately been the great Professor Kant.
     Juan, who cared not a tobacco-stopper
       About philosophy, pursued his jaunt
     To Germany, whose somewhat tardy millions
     Have princes who spur more than their postilions.

     And thence through Berlin, Dresden, and the like,
       Until he reach'd the castellated Rhine:--
     Ye glorious Gothic scenes! how much ye strike
       All phantasies, not even excepting mine;
     A grey wall, a green ruin, rusty pike,
       Make my soul pass the equinoctial line
     Between the present and past worlds, and hover
     Upon their airy confine, half-seas-over.

     But Juan posted on through Manheim, Bonn,
       Which Drachenfels frowns over like a spectre
     Of the good feudal times forever gone,
       On which I have not time just now to lecture.
     From thence he was drawn onwards to Cologne,
       A city which presents to the inspector
     Eleven thousand maidenheads of bone,
     The greatest number flesh hath ever known.

     From thence to Holland's Hague and Helvoetsluys,
       That water-land of Dutchmen and of ditches,
     Where juniper expresses its best juice,
       The poor man's sparkling substitute for riches.
     Senates and sages have condemn'd its use--
       But to deny the mob a cordial, which is
     Too often all the clothing, meat, or fuel,
     Good government has left them, seems but cruel.

     Here he embark'd, and with a flowing sail
       Went bounding for the island of the free,
     Towards which the impatient wind blew half a gale;
       High dash'd the spray, the bows dipp'd in the sea,
     And sea-sick passengers turn'd somewhat pale;
       But Juan, season'd, as he well might be,
     By former voyages, stood to watch the skiffs
     Which pass'd, or catch the first glimpse of the cliffs.

     At length they rose, like a white wall along
       The blue sea's border; and I Don Juan felt--
     What even young strangers feel a little strong
       At the first sight of Albion's chalky belt--
     A kind of pride that he should be among
       Those haughty shopkeepers, who sternly dealt
     Their goods and edicts out from pole to pole,
     And made the very billows pay them toll.

     I 've no great cause to love that spot of earth,
       Which holds what might have been the noblest nation;
     But though I owe it little but my birth,
       I feel a mix'd regret and veneration
     For its decaying fame and former worth.
       Seven years (the usual term of transportation)
     Of absence lay one's old resentments level,
     When a man's country 's going to the devil.

     Alas! could she but fully, truly, know
       How her great name is now throughout abhorr'd:
     How eager all the earth is for the blow
       Which shall lay bare her bosom to the sword;
     How all the nations deem her their worst foe,
       That worse than worst of foes, the once adored
     False friend, who held out freedom to mankind,
     And now would chain them, to the very mind:--

     Would she be proud, or boast herself the free,
       Who is but first of slaves? The nations are
     In prison,--but the gaoler, what is he?
       No less a victim to the bolt and bar.
     Is the poor privilege to turn the key
       Upon the captive, freedom? He 's as far
     From the enjoyment of the earth and air
     Who watches o'er the chain, as they who wear.

     Don Juan now saw Albion's earliest beauties,
       Thy cliffs, dear Dover! harbour, and hotel;
     Thy custom-house, with all its delicate duties;
       Thy waiters running mucks at every bell;
     Thy packets, all whose passengers are booties
       To those who upon land or water dwell;
     And last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,
     Thy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted.

     Juan, though careless, young, and magnifique,
       And rich in rubles, diamonds, cash, and credit,
     Who did not limit much his bills per week,
       Yet stared at this a little, though he paid it
     (His Maggior Duomo, a smart, subtle Greek,
       Before him summ'd the awful scroll and read it);
     But doubtless as the air, though seldom sunny,
     Is free, the respiration's worth the money.

     On with the horses! Off to Canterbury!
       Tramp, tramp o'er pebble, and splash, splash through puddle;
     Hurrah! how swiftly speeds the post so merry!
       Not like slow Germany, wherein they muddle
     Along the road, as if they went to bury
       Their fare; and also pause besides, to fuddle
     With 'schnapps'--sad dogs! whom 'Hundsfot,' or 'Verflucter,'
     Affect no more than lightning a conductor.

     Now there is nothing gives a man such spirits,
       Leavening his blood as cayenne doth a curry,
     As going at full speed--no matter where its
       Direction be, so 't is but in a hurry,
     And merely for the sake of its own merits;
       For the less cause there is for all this flurry,
     The greater is the pleasure in arriving
     At the great end of travel--which is driving.

     They saw at Canterbury the cathedral;
       Black Edward's helm, and Becket's bloody stone,
     Were pointed out as usual by the bedral,
       In the same quaint, uninterested tone:--
     There 's glory again for you, gentle reader! All
       Ends in a rusty casque and dubious bone,
     Half-solved into these sodas or magnesias;
     Which form that bitter draught, the human species.

     The effect on Juan was of course sublime:
       He breathed a thousand Cressys, as he saw
     That casque, which never stoop'd except to Time.
       Even the bold Churchman's tomb excited awe,
     Who died in the then great attempt to climb
       O'er kings, who now at least must talk of law
     Before they butcher. Little Leila gazed,
     And ask'd why such a structure had been raised:

     And being told it was 'God's house,' she said
       He was well lodged, but only wonder'd how
     He suffer'd Infidels in his homestead,
       The cruel Nazarenes, who had laid low
     His holy temples in the lands which bred
       The True Believers:--and her infant brow
     Was bent with grief that Mahomet should resign
     A mosque so noble, flung like pearls to swine.

     O! oh! through meadows managed like a garden,
       A paradise of hops and high production;
     For after years of travel by a bard in
       Countries of greater heat, but lesser suction,
     A green field is a sight which makes him pardon
       The absence of that more sublime construction,
     Which mixes up vines, olives, precipices,
     Glaciers, volcanos, oranges, and ices.

     And when I think upon a pot of beer--
       But I won't weep!--and so drive on, postilions!
     As the smart boys spurr'd fast in their career,
       Juan admired these highways of free millions;
     A country in all senses the most dear
       To foreigner or native, save some silly ones,
     Who 'kick against the pricks' just at this juncture,
     And for their pains get only a fresh puncture.

     What a delightful thing 's a turnpike road!
       So smooth, so level, such a mode of shaving
     The earth, as scarce the eagle in the broad
       Air can accomplish, with his wide wings waving.
     Had such been cut in Phaeton's time, the god
       Had told his son to satisfy his craving
     With the York mail;--but onward as we roll,
     'Surgit amari aliquid'--the toll

     Alas, how deeply painful is all payment!
       Take lives, take wives, take aught except men's purses:
     As Machiavel shows those in purple raiment,
       Such is the shortest way to general curses.
     They hate a murderer much less than a claimant
       On that sweet ore which every body nurses;--
     Kill a man's family, and he may brook it,
     But keep your hands out of his breeches' pocket.

     So said the Florentine: ye monarchs, hearken
       To your instructor. Juan now was borne,
     Just as the day began to wane and darken,
       O'er the high hill, which looks with pride or scorn
     Toward the great city.--Ye who have a spark in
       Your veins of Cockney spirit, smile or mourn
     According as you take things well or ill;--
     Bold Britons, we are now on Shooter's Hill!

     The sun went down, the smoke rose up, as from
       A half-unquench'd volcano, o'er a space
     Which well beseem'd the 'Devil's drawing-room,'
       As some have qualified that wondrous place:
     But Juan felt, though not approaching home,
       As one who, though he were not of the race,
     Revered the soil, of those true sons the mother,
     Who butcher'd half the earth, and bullied t' other.

     A mighty mass of brick, and smoke, and shipping,
       Dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye
     Could reach, with here and there a sail just skipping
       In sight, then lost amidst the forestry
     Of masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping
       On tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy;
     A huge, dun cupola, like a foolscap crown
     On a fool's head--and there is London Town!

     But Juan saw not this: each wreath of smoke
       Appear'd to him but as the magic vapour
     Of some alchymic furnace, from whence broke
       The wealth of worlds (a wealth of tax and paper):
     The gloomy clouds, which o'er it as a yoke
       Are bow'd, and put the sun out like a taper,
     Were nothing but the natural atmosphere,
     Extremely wholesome, though but rarely clear.

     He paused--and so will I; as doth a crew
       Before they give their broadside. By and by,
     My gentle countrymen, we will renew
       Our old acquaintance; and at least I 'll try
     To tell you truths you will not take as true,
       Because they are so;--a male Mrs. Fry,
     With a soft besom will I sweep your halls,
     And brush a web or two from off the walls.

     O Mrs. Fry! Why go to Newgate? Why
       Preach to poor rogues? And wherefore not begin
     With Carlton, or with other houses? Try
       Your head at harden'd and imperial sin.
     To mend the people 's an absurdity,
       A jargon, a mere philanthropic din,
     Unless you make their betters better:--Fy!
     I thought you had more religion, Mrs. Fry.

     Teach them the decencies of good threescore;
       Cure them of tours, hussar and highland dresses;
     Tell them that youth once gone returns no more,
       That hired huzzas redeem no land's distresses;
     Tell them Sir William Curtis is a bore,
       Too dull even for the dullest of excesses,
     The witless Falstaff of a hoary Hal,
     A fool whose bells have ceased to ring at all.

     Tell them, though it may be perhaps too late,
       On life's worn confine, jaded, bloated, sated,
     To set up vain pretence of being great,
       'T is not so to be good; and be it stated,
     The worthiest kings have ever loved least state;
       And tell them--But you won't, and I have prated
     Just now enough; but by and by I 'll prattle
     Like Roland's horn in Roncesvalles' battle.


[Illustration: Canto 11]




CANTO THE ELEVENTH.

     When Bishop Berkeley said 'there was no matter,'
       And proved it--'t was no matter what he said:
     They say his system 't is in vain to batter,
       Too subtle for the airiest human head;
     And yet who can believe it? I would shatter
       Gladly all matters down to stone or lead,
     Or adamant, to find the world a spirit,
     And wear my head, denying that I wear it.

     What a sublime discovery 't was to make the
       Universe universal egotism,
     That all 's ideal--all ourselves: I 'll stake the
       World (be it what you will) that that 's no schism.
     O Doubt!--if thou be'st Doubt, for which some take thee;
       But which I doubt extremely--thou sole prism
     Of the Truth's rays, spoil not my draught of spirit!
     Heaven's brandy, though our brain can hardly bear it.

     For ever and anon comes Indigestion,
       (Not the most 'dainty Ariel') and perplexes
     Our soarings with another sort of question:
       And that which after all my spirit vexes,
     Is, that I find no spot where man can rest eye on,
       Without confusion of the sorts and sexes,
     Of beings, stars, and this unriddled wonder,
     The world, which at the worst 's a glorious blunder--

     If it be chance; or if it be according
       To the old text, still better:--lest it should
     Turn out so, we 'll say nothing 'gainst the wording,
       As several people think such hazards rude.
     They 're right; our days are too brief for affording
       Space to dispute what no one ever could
     Decide, and every body one day will
     Know very clearly--or at least lie still.

     And therefore will I leave off metaphysical
       Discussion, which is neither here nor there:
     If I agree that what is, is; then this I call
       Being quite perspicuous and extremely fair;
     The truth is, I 've grown lately rather phthisical:
       I don't know what the reason is--the air
     Perhaps; but as I suffer from the shocks
     Of illness, I grow much more orthodox.

     The first attack at once proved the Divinity
       (But that I never doubted, nor the Devil);
     The next, the Virgin's mystical virginity;
       The third, the usual Origin of Evil;
     The fourth at once establish'd the whole Trinity
       On so uncontrovertible a level,
     That I devoutly wish'd the three were four,
     On purpose to believe so much the more.

     To our Theme.--The man who has stood on the Acropolis,
       And look'd down over Attica; or he
     Who has sail'd where picturesque Constantinople is,
       Or seen Timbuctoo, or hath taken tea
     In small-eyed China's crockery-ware metropolis,
       Or sat amidst the bricks of Nineveh,
     May not think much of London's first appearance--
     But ask him what he thinks of it a year hence?

     Don Juan had got out on Shooter's Hill;
       Sunset the time, the place the same declivity
     Which looks along that vale of good and ill
       Where London streets ferment in full activity;
     While every thing around was calm and still,
       Except the creak of wheels, which on their pivot he
     Heard,--and that bee-like, bubbling, busy hum
     Of cities, that boil over with their scum:--

     I say, Don Juan, wrapt in contemplation,
       Walk'd on behind his carriage, o'er the summit,
     And lost in wonder of so great a nation,
       Gave way to 't, since he could not overcome it.
     'And here,' he cried, 'is Freedom's chosen station;
       Here peals the people's voice, nor can entomb it
     Racks, prisons, inquisitions; resurrection
     Awaits it, each new meeting or election.

     'Here are chaste wives, pure lives; here people pay
       But what they please; and if that things be dear,
     'T is only that they love to throw away
       Their cash, to show how much they have a-year.
     Here laws are all inviolate; none lay
       Traps for the traveller; every highway 's clear:
     Here-' he was interrupted by a knife,
     With,--'Damn your eyes! your money or your life!'

     These freeborn sounds proceeded from four pads
       In ambush laid, who had perceived him loiter
     Behind his carriage; and, like handy lads,
       Had seized the lucky hour to reconnoitre,
     In which the heedless gentleman who gads
       Upon the road, unless he prove a fighter,
     May find himself within that isle of riches
     Exposed to lose his life as well as breeches.

     Juan, who did not understand a word
       Of English, save their shibboleth, 'God damn!'
     And even that he had so rarely heard,
       He sometimes thought 't was only their 'Salam,'
     Or 'God be with you!'--and 't is not absurd
       To think so: for half English as I am
     (To my misfortune), never can I say
     I heard them wish 'God with you,' save that way;--

     Juan yet quickly understood their gesture,
       And being somewhat choleric and sudden,
     Drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture,
       And fired it into one assailant's pudding--
     Who fell, as rolls an ox o'er in his pasture,
       And roar'd out, as he writhed his native mud in,
     Unto his nearest follower or henchman,
     'Oh Jack! I 'm floor'd by that 'ere bloody Frenchman!'

     On which Jack and his train set off at speed,
       And Juan's suite, late scatter'd at a distance,
     Came up, all marvelling at such a deed,
       And offering, as usual, late assistance.
     Juan, who saw the moon's late minion bleed
       As if his veins would pour out his existence,
     Stood calling out for bandages and lint,
     And wish'd he had been less hasty with his flint.

     'Perhaps,' thought he, 'it is the country's wont
       To welcome foreigners in this way: now
     I recollect some innkeepers who don't
       Differ, except in robbing with a bow,
     In lieu of a bare blade and brazen front.
       But what is to be done? I can't allow
     The fellow to lie groaning on the road:
     So take him up; I 'll help you with the load.'

     But ere they could perform this pious duty,
       The dying man cried, 'Hold! I 've got my gruel!
     O for a glass of max! We 've miss'd our booty;
       Let me die where I am!' And as the fuel
     Of life shrunk in his heart, and thick and sooty
       The drops fell from his death-wound, and he drew ill
     His breath,--he from his swelling throat untied
     A kerchief, crying, 'Give Sal that!'--and died.

     The cravat stain'd with bloody drops fell down
       Before Don Juan's feet: he could not tell
     Exactly why it was before him thrown,
       Nor what the meaning of the man's farewell.
     Poor Tom was once a kiddy upon town,
       A thorough varmint, and a real swell,
     Full flash, all fancy, until fairly diddled,
     His pockets first and then his body riddled.

     Don Juan, having done the best he could
       In all the circumstances of the case,
     As soon as 'Crowner's quest' allow'd, pursued
       His travels to the capital apace;--
     Esteeming it a little hard he should
       In twelve hours' time, and very little space,
     Have been obliged to slay a freeborn native
     In self-defence: this made him meditative.

     He from the world had cut off a great man,
       Who in his time had made heroic bustle.
     Who in a row like Tom could lead the van,
       Booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle?
     Who queer a flat? Who (spite of Bow Street's ban)
       On the high toby-spice so flash the muzzle?
     Who on a lark, with black-eyed Sal (his blowing),
     So prime, so swell, so nutty, and so knowing?

     But Tom's no more--and so no more of Tom.
       Heroes must die; and by God's blessing 't is
     Not long before the most of them go home.
       Hail! Thamis, Hail! Upon thy verge it is
     That Juan's chariot, rolling like a drum
       In thunder, holds the way it can't well miss,
     Through Kennington and all the other 'tons,'
     Which makes us wish ourselves in town at once;--

     Through Groves, so call'd as being void of trees
       (Like lucus from no light); through prospects named
     Mount Pleasant, as containing nought to please,
       Nor much to climb; through little boxes framed
     Of bricks, to let the dust in at your ease,
       With 'To be let' upon their doors proclaim'd;
     Through 'Rows' most modestly call'd 'Paradise,'
     Which Eve might quit without much sacrifice;--

     Through coaches, drays, choked turnpikes, and a whirl
       Of wheels, and roar of voices, and confusion;
     Here taverns wooing to a pint of 'purl,'
       There mails fast flying off like a delusion;
     There barbers' blocks with periwigs in curl
       In windows; here the lamplighter's infusion
     Slowly distill'd into the glimmering glass
     (For in those days we had not got to gas);--

     Through this, and much, and more, is the approach
       Of travellers to mighty Babylon:
     Whether they come by horse, or chaise, or coach,
       With slight exceptions, all the ways seem one.
     I could say more, but do not choose to encroach
       Upon the Guide-book's privilege. The sun
     Had set some time, and night was on the ridge
     Of twilight, as the party cross'd the bridge,--

     That 's rather fine. The gentle sound of Thamis--
       Who vindicates a moment, too, his stream,
     Though hardly heard through multifarious 'damme's'-
       The lamps of Westminster's more regular gleam,
     The breadth of pavement, and yon shrine where fame is
       A spectral resident--whose pallid beam
     In shape of moonshine hovers o'er the pile--
     Make this a sacred part of Albion's isle.

     The Druids' groves are gone--so much the better:
       Stone-Henge is not--but what the devil is it?-
     But Bedlam still exists with its sage fetter,
       That madmen may not bite you on a visit;
     The Bench too seats or suits full many a debtor;
       The Mansion House too (though some people quiz it)
     To me appears a stiff yet grand erection;
     But then the Abbey 's worth the whole collection.

     The line of lights, too, up to Charing Cross,
       Pall Mall, and so forth, have a coruscation
     Like gold as in comparison to dross,
       Match'd with the Continent's illumination,
     Whose cities Night by no means deigns to gloss.
       The French were not yet a lamp-lighting nation,
     And when they grew so--on their new-found lantern,
     Instead of wicks, they made a wicked man turn.

     A row of gentlemen along the streets
       Suspended may illuminate mankind,
     As also bonfires made of country seats;
       But the old way is best for the purblind:
     The other looks like phosphorus on sheets,
       A sort of ignis fatuus to the mind,
     Which, though 't is certain to perplex and frighten,
     Must burn more mildly ere it can enlighten.

     But London 's so well lit, that if Diogenes
       Could recommence to hunt his honest man,
     And found him not amidst the various progenies
       Of this enormous city's spreading span,
     'T were not for want of lamps to aid his dodging his
       Yet undiscover'd treasure. What I can,
     I 've done to find the same throughout life's journey,
     But see the world is only one attorney.

     Over the stones still rattling up Pall Mall,
       Through crowds and carriages, but waxing thinner
     As thunder'd knockers broke the long seal'd spell
       Of doors 'gainst duns, and to an early dinner
     Admitted a small party as night fell,--
       Don Juan, our young diplomatic sinner,
     Pursued his path, and drove past some hotels,
     St. James's Palace and St. James's 'Hells.'

     They reach'd the hotel: forth stream'd from the front door
       A tide of well-clad waiters, and around
     The mob stood, and as usual several score
       Of those pedestrian Paphians who abound
     In decent London when the daylight 's o'er;
       Commodious but immoral, they are found
     Useful, like Malthus, in promoting marriage.-
     But Juan now is stepping from his carriage

     Into one of the sweetest of hotels,
       Especially for foreigners--and mostly
     For those whom favour or whom fortune swells,
       And cannot find a bill's small items costly.
     There many an envoy either dwelt or dwells
       (The den of many a diplomatic lost lie),
     Until to some conspicuous square they pass,
     And blazon o'er the door their names in brass.

     Juan, whose was a delicate commission,
       Private, though publicly important, bore
     No title to point out with due precision
       The exact affair on which he was sent o'er.
     'T was merely known, that on a secret mission
       A foreigner of rank had graced our shore,
     Young, handsome, and accomplish'd, who was said
     (In whispers) to have turn'd his sovereign's head.

     Some rumour also of some strange adventures
       Had gone before him, and his wars and loves;
     And as romantic heads are pretty painters,
       And, above all, an Englishwoman's roves
     Into the excursive, breaking the indentures
       Of sober reason wheresoe'er it moves,
     He found himself extremely in the fashion,
     Which serves our thinking people for a passion.

     I don't mean that they are passionless, but quite
       The contrary; but then 't is in the head;
     Yet as the consequences are as bright
       As if they acted with the heart instead,
     What after all can signify the site
       Of ladies' lucubrations? So they lead
     In safety to the place for which you start,
     What matters if the road be head or heart?

     Juan presented in the proper place,
       To proper placemen, every Russ credential;
     And was received with all the due grimace
       By those who govern in the mood potential,
     Who, seeing a handsome stripling with smooth face,
       Thought (what in state affairs is most essential)
     That they as easily might do the youngster,
     As hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster.

     They err'd, as aged men will do; but by
       And by we 'll talk of that; and if we don't,
     'T will be because our notion is not high
       Of politicians and their double front,
     Who live by lies, yet dare not boldly lie:--
       Now what I love in women is, they won't
     Or can't do otherwise than lie, but do it
     So well, the very truth seems falsehood to it.

     And, after all, what is a lie? 'T is but
       The truth in masquerade; and I defy
     Historians, heroes, lawyers, priests, to put
       A fact without some leaven of a lie.
     The very shadow of true Truth would shut
       Up annals, revelations, poesy,
     And prophecy--except it should be dated
     Some years before the incidents related.

     Praised be all liars and all lies! Who now
       Can tax my mild Muse with misanthropy?
     She rings the world's 'Te Deum,' and her brow
       Blushes for those who will not:--but to sigh
     Is idle; let us like most others bow,
       Kiss hands, feet, any part of majesty,
     After the good example of 'Green Erin,'
     Whose shamrock now seems rather worse for wearing.

     Don Juan was presented, and his dress
       And mien excited general admiration--
     I don't know which was more admired or less:
       One monstrous diamond drew much observation,
     Which Catherine in a moment of 'ivresse'
       (In love or brandy's fervent fermentation)
     Bestow'd upon him, as the public learn'd;
     And, to say truth, it had been fairly earn'd.

     Besides the ministers and underlings,
       Who must be courteous to the accredited
     Diplomatists of rather wavering kings,
       Until their royal riddle 's fully read,
     The very clerks,--those somewhat dirty springs
       Of office, or the house of office, fed
     By foul corruption into streams,--even they
     Were hardly rude enough to earn their pay:

     And insolence no doubt is what they are
       Employ'd for, since it is their daily labour,
     In the dear offices of peace or war;
       And should you doubt, pray ask of your next neighbour,
     When for a passport, or some other bar
       To freedom, he applied (a grief and a bore),
     If he found not his spawn of taxborn riches,

     But Juan was received with much 'empressement:'-
       These phrases of refinement I must borrow
     From our next neighbours' land, where, like a chessman,
       There is a move set down for joy or sorrow
     Not only in mere talking, but the press. Man
       In islands is, it seems, downright and thorough,
     More than on continents--as if the sea
     (See Billingsgate) made even the tongue more free.

     And yet the British 'Damme' 's rather Attic:
       Your continental oaths are but incontinent,
     And turn on things which no aristocratic
       Spirit would name, and therefore even I won't anent
     This subject quote; as it would be schismatic
       In politesse, and have a sound affronting in 't:--
     But 'Damme' 's quite ethereal, though too daring--
     Platonic blasphemy, the soul of swearing.

     For downright rudeness, ye may stay at home;
       For true or false politeness (and scarce that
     Now) you may cross the blue deep and white foam--
       The first the emblem (rarely though) of what
     You leave behind, the next of much you come
       To meet. However, 't is no time to chat
     On general topics: poems must confine
     Themselves to unity, like this of mine.

     In the great world,--which, being interpreted,
       Meaneth the west or worst end of a city,
     And about twice two thousand people bred
       By no means to be very wise or witty,
     But to sit up while others lie in bed,
       And look down on the universe with pity,--
     Juan, as an inveterate patrician,
     Was well received by persons of condition.

     He was a bachelor, which is a matter
       Of import both to virgin and to bride,
     The former's hymeneal hopes to flatter;
       And (should she not hold fast by love or pride)
     'T is also of some moment to the latter:
       A rib 's a thorn in a wed gallant's side,
     Requires decorum, and is apt to double
     The horrid sin--and what 's still worse, the trouble.

     But Juan was a bachelor--of arts,
       And parts, and hearts: he danced and sung, and had
     An air as sentimental as Mozart's
       Softest of melodies; and could be sad
     Or cheerful, without any 'flaws or starts,'
       Just at the proper time; and though a lad,
     Had seen the world--which is a curious sight,
     And very much unlike what people write.

     Fair virgins blush'd upon him; wedded dames
       Bloom'd also in less transitory hues;
     For both commodities dwell by the Thames,
       The painting and the painted; youth, ceruse,
     Against his heart preferr'd their usual claims,
       Such as no gentleman can quite refuse:
     Daughters admired his dress, and pious mothers
     Inquired his income, and if he had brothers.

     The milliners who furnish 'drapery Misses'
       Throughout the season, upon speculation
     Of payment ere the honey-moon's last kisses
       Have waned into a crescent's coruscation,
     Thought such an opportunity as this is,
       Of a rich foreigner's initiation,
     Not to be overlook'd--and gave such credit,
     That future bridegrooms swore, and sigh'd, and paid it.

     The Blues, that tender tribe who sigh o'er sonnets,
       And with the pages of the last Review
     Line the interior of their heads or bonnets,
       Advanced in all their azure's highest hue:
     They talk'd bad French or Spanish, and upon its
       Late authors ask'd him for a hint or two;
     And which was softest, Russian or Castilian?
     And whether in his travels he saw Ilion?

     Juan, who was a little superficial,
       And not in literature a great Drawcansir,
     Examined by this learned and especial
       Jury of matrons, scarce knew what to answer:
     His duties warlike, loving or official,
       His steady application as a dancer,
     Had kept him from the brink of Hippocrene,
     Which now he found was blue instead of green.

     However, he replied at hazard, with
       A modest confidence and calm assurance,
     Which lent his learned lucubrations pith,
       And pass'd for arguments of good endurance.
     That prodigy, Miss Araminta Smith
       (Who at sixteen translated 'Hercules Furens'
     Into as furious English), with her best look,
     Set down his sayings in her common-place book.

     Juan knew several languages--as well
       He might--and brought them up with skill, in time
     To save his fame with each accomplish'd belle,
       Who still regretted that he did not rhyme.
     There wanted but this requisite to swell
       His qualities (with them) into sublime:
     Lady Fitz-Frisky, and Miss Maevia Mannish,
     Both long'd extremely to be sung in Spanish.

     However, he did pretty well, and was
       Admitted as an aspirant to all
     The coteries, and, as in Banquo's glass,
       At great assemblies or in parties small,
     He saw ten thousand living authors pass,
       That being about their average numeral;
     Also the eighty 'greatest living poets,'
     As every paltry magazine can show its.

     In twice five years the 'greatest living poet,'
       Like to the champion in the fisty ring,
     Is call'd on to support his claim, or show it,
       Although 't is an imaginary thing.
     Even I--albeit I 'm sure I did not know it,
       Nor sought of foolscap subjects to be king--
     Was reckon'd a considerable time,
     The grand Napoleon of the realms of rhyme.

     But Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero
       My Leipsic, and my Mount Saint Jean seems Cain:
     'La Belle Alliance' of dunces down at zero,
       Now that the Lion 's fall'n, may rise again:
     But I will fall at least as fell my hero;
       Nor reign at all, or as a monarch reign;
     Or to some lonely isle of gaolers go,
     With turncoat Southey for my turnkey Lowe.

     Sir Walter reign'd before me; Moore and Campbell
       Before and after; but now grown more holy,
     The Muses upon Sion's hill must ramble
       With poets almost clergymen, or wholly;
     And Pegasus hath a psalmodic amble
       Beneath the very Reverend Rowley Powley,
     Who shoes the glorious animal with stilts,
     A modern Ancient Pistol--by the hilts?

     Then there 's my gentle Euphues, who, they say,
       Sets up for being a sort of moral me;
     He 'll find it rather difficult some day
       To turn out both, or either, it may be.
     Some persons think that Coleridge hath the sway;
       And Wordsworth has supporters, two or three;
     And that deep-mouth'd Boeotian 'Savage Landor'
     Has taken for a swan rogue Southey's gander.

     John Keats, who was kill'd off by one critique,
       Just as he really promised something great,
     If not intelligible, without Greek
       Contrived to talk about the gods of late,
     Much as they might have been supposed to speak.
       Poor fellow! His was an untoward fate;
     'T is strange the mind, that very fiery particle,
     Should let itself be snuff'd out by an article.

     The list grows long of live and dead pretenders
       To that which none will gain--or none will know
     The conqueror at least; who, ere Time renders
       His last award, will have the long grass grow
     Above his burnt-out brain, and sapless cinders.
       If I might augur, I should rate but low
     Their chances; they 're too numerous, like the thirty
     Mock tyrants, when Rome's annals wax'd but dirty.

     This is the literary lower empire,
       Where the praetorian bands take up the matter;--
     A 'dreadful trade,' like his who 'gathers samphire,'
       The insolent soldiery to soothe and flatter,
     With the same feelings as you 'd coax a vampire.
       Now, were I once at home, and in good satire,
     I 'd try conclusions with those Janizaries,
     And show them what an intellectual war is.

     I think I know a trick or two, would turn
       Their flanks;--but it is hardly worth my while
     With such small gear to give myself concern:
       Indeed I 've not the necessary bile;
     My natural temper 's really aught but stern,
       And even my Muse's worst reproof 's a smile;
     And then she drops a brief and modern curtsy,
     And glides away, assured she never hurts ye.

     My Juan, whom I left in deadly peril
       Amongst live poets and blue ladies, past
     With some small profit through that field so sterile,
       Being tired in time, and, neither least nor last,
     Left it before he had been treated very ill;
       And henceforth found himself more gaily class'd
     Amongst the higher spirits of the day,
     The sun's true son, no vapour, but a ray.

     His morns he pass'd in business--which, dissected,
       Was like all business a laborious nothing
     That leads to lassitude, the most infected
       And Centaur Nessus garb of mortal clothing,
     And on our sofas makes us lie dejected,
       And talk in tender horrors of our loathing
     All kinds of toil, save for our country's good--
     Which grows no better, though 't is time it should.

     His afternoons he pass'd in visits, luncheons,
       Lounging and boxing; and the twilight hour
     In riding round those vegetable puncheons
       Call'd 'Parks,' where there is neither fruit nor flower
     Enough to gratify a bee's slight munchings;
       But after all it is the only 'bower'
     (In Moore's phrase), where the fashionable fair
     Can form a slight acquaintance with fresh air.

     Then dress, then dinner, then awakes the world!
       Then glare the lamps, then whirl the wheels, then roar
     Through street and square fast flashing chariots hurl'd
       Like harness'd meteors; then along the floor
     Chalk mimics painting; then festoons are twirl'd;
       Then roll the brazen thunders of the door,
     Which opens to the thousand happy few
     An earthly paradise of 'Or Molu.'

     There stands the noble hostess, nor shall sink
       With the three-thousandth curtsy; there the waltz,
     The only dance which teaches girls to think,
       Makes one in love even with its very faults.
     Saloon, room, hall, o'erflow beyond their brink,
       And long the latest of arrivals halts,
     'Midst royal dukes and dames condemn'd to climb,
     And gain an inch of staircase at a time.

     Thrice happy he who, after a survey
       Of the good company, can win a corner,
     A door that's in or boudoir out of the way,
       Where he may fix himself like small 'Jack Horner,'
     And let the Babel round run as it may,
       And look on as a mourner, or a scorner,
     Or an approver, or a mere spectator,
     Yawning a little as the night grows later.

     But this won't do, save by and by; and he
       Who, like Don Juan, takes an active share,
     Must steer with care through all that glittering sea
       Of gems and plumes and pearls and silks, to where
     He deems it is his proper place to be;
       Dissolving in the waltz to some soft air,
     Or proudlier prancing with mercurial skill
     Where Science marshals forth her own quadrille.

     Or, if he dance not, but hath higher views
       Upon an heiress or his neighbour's bride,
     Let him take care that that which he pursues
       Is not at once too palpably descried.
     Full many an eager gentleman oft rues
       His haste: impatience is a blundering guide,
     Amongst a people famous for reflection,
     Who like to play the fool with circumspection.

     But, if you can contrive, get next at supper;
       Or, if forestalled, get opposite and ogle:--
     O, ye ambrosial moments! always upper
       In mind, a sort of sentimental bogle,
     Which sits for ever upon memory's crupper,
       The ghost of vanish'd pleasures once in vogue! Ill
     Can tender souls relate the rise and fall
     Of hopes and fears which shake a single ball.

     But these precautionary hints can touch
       Only the common run, who must pursue,
     And watch, and ward; whose plans a word too much
       Or little overturns; and not the few
     Or many (for the number's sometimes such)
       Whom a good mien, especially if new,
     Or fame, or name, for wit, war, sense, or nonsense,
     Permits whate'er they please, or did not long since.

     Our hero, as a hero, young and handsome,
       Noble, rich, celebrated, and a stranger,
     Like other slaves of course must pay his ransom,
       Before he can escape from so much danger
     As will environ a conspicuous man. Some
       Talk about poetry, and 'rack and manger,'
     And ugliness, disease, as toil and trouble;--
     I wish they knew the life of a young noble.

     They are young, but know not youth--it is anticipated;
       Handsome but wasted, rich without a sou;
     Their vigour in a thousand arms is dissipated;
       Their cash comes from, their wealth goes to a Jew;
     Both senates see their nightly votes participated
       Between the tyrant's and the tribunes' crew;
     And having voted, dined, drunk, gamed, and whored,
     The family vault receives another lord.

     'Where is the world?' cries Young, at eighty--'Where
       The world in which a man was born? 'Alas!
     Where is the world of eight years past? 'T was there--
       I look for it--'t is gone, a globe of glass!
     Crack'd, shiver'd, vanish'd, scarcely gazed on, ere
       A silent change dissolves the glittering mass.
     Statesmen, chiefs, orators, queens, patriots, kings,
     And dandies, all are gone on the wind's wings.

     Where is Napoleon the Grand? God knows.
       Where little Castlereagh? The devil can tell:
     Where Grattan, Curran, Sheridan, all those
       Who bound the bar or senate in their spell?
     Where is the unhappy Queen, with all her woes?
       And where the Daughter, whom the Isles loved well?
     Where are those martyr'd saints the Five per Cents?
     And where--oh, where the devil are the rents?

     Where 's Brummel? Dish'd. Where 's Long Pole Wellesley? Diddled.
       Where 's Whitbread? Romilly? Where 's George the Third?
     Where is his will? (That 's not so soon unriddled.)
       And where is 'Fum' the Fourth, our 'royal bird?'
     Gone down, it seems, to Scotland to be fiddled
       Unto by Sawney's violin, we have heard:
     'Caw me, caw thee'--for six months hath been hatching
     This scene of royal itch and loyal scratching.

     Where is Lord This? And where my Lady That?
       The Honourable Mistresses and Misses?
     Some laid aside like an old Opera hat,
       Married, unmarried, and remarried (this is
     An evolution oft performed of late).
       Where are the Dublin shouts--and London hisses?
     Where are the Grenvilles? Turn'd as usual. Where
     My friends the Whigs? Exactly where they were.

     Where are the Lady Carolines and Franceses?
       Divorced or doing thereanent. Ye annals
     So brilliant, where the list of routs and dances is,--
       Thou Morning Post, sole record of the panels
     Broken in carriages, and all the phantasies
       Of fashion,--say what streams now fill those channels?
     Some die, some fly, some languish on the Continent,
     Because the times have hardly left them one tenant.

     Some who once set their caps at cautious dukes,
       Have taken up at length with younger brothers:
     Some heiresses have bit at sharpers' hooks:
       Some maids have been made wives, some merely mothers;
     Others have lost their fresh and fairy looks:
       In short, the list of alterations bothers.
     There 's little strange in this, but something strange is
     The unusual quickness of these common changes.

     Talk not of seventy years as age; in seven
       I have seen more changes, down from monarchs to
     The humblest individual under heaven,
       Than might suffice a moderate century through.
     I knew that nought was lasting, but now even
       Change grows too changeable, without being new:
     Nought 's permanent among the human race,
     Except the Whigs not getting into place.

     I have seen Napoleon, who seem'd quite a Jupiter,
       Shrink to a Saturn. I have seen a Duke
     (No matter which) turn politician stupider,
       If that can well be, than his wooden look.
     But it is time that I should hoist my 'blue Peter,'
       And sail for a new theme:--I have seen--and shook
     To see it--the king hiss'd, and then caress'd;
     But don't pretend to settle which was best.

     I have seen the Landholders without a rap--
       I have seen Joanna Southcote--I have seen--
     The House of Commons turn'd to a tax-trap--
       I have seen that sad affair of the late Queen--
     I have seen crowns worn instead of a fool's cap--
       I have seen a Congress doing all that 's mean--
     I have seen some nations like o'erloaded asses
     Kick off their burthens, meaning the high classes.

     I have seen small poets, and great prosers, and
       Interminable--not eternal--speakers--
     I have seen the funds at war with house and land--
       I have seen the country gentlemen turn squeakers--
     I have seen the people ridden o'er like sand
       By slaves on horseback--I have seen malt liquors
     Exchanged for 'thin potations' by John Bull--
     I have seen john half detect himself a fool.-

     But 'carpe diem,' Juan, 'carpe, carpe!'
       To-morrow sees another race as gay
     And transient, and devour'd by the same harpy.
       'Life 's a poor player,'--then 'play out the play,
     Ye villains!' above all keep a sharp eye
       Much less on what you do than what you say:
     Be hypocritical, be cautious, be
     Not what you seem, but always what you see.

     But how shall I relate in other cantos
       Of what befell our hero in the land,
     Which 't is the common cry and lie to vaunt as
       A moral country? But I hold my hand--
     For I disdain to write an Atalantis;
       But 't is as well at once to understand,
     You are not a moral people, and you know it
     Without the aid of too sincere a poet.

     What Juan saw and underwent shall be
       My topic, with of course the due restriction
     Which is required by proper courtesy;
       And recollect the work is only fiction,
     And that I sing of neither mine nor me,
       Though every scribe, in some slight turn of diction,
     Will hint allusions never meant. Ne'er doubt
     This--when I speak, I don't hint, but speak out.

     Whether he married with the third or fourth
       Offspring of some sage husband-hunting countess,
     Or whether with some virgin of more worth
       (I mean in Fortune's matrimonial bounties)
     He took to regularly peopling Earth,
       Of which your lawful awful wedlock fount is,--
     Or whether he was taken in for damages,
     For being too excursive in his homages,--

     Is yet within the unread events of time.
       Thus far, go forth, thou lay, which I will back
     Against the same given quantity of rhyme,
       For being as much the subject of attack
     As ever yet was any work sublime,
       By those who love to say that white is black.
     So much the better!--I may stand alone,
     But would not change my free thoughts for a throne.


[Illustration: Canto 12]




CANTO THE TWELTH.

     Of all the barbarous middle ages, that
       Which is most barbarous is the middle age
     Of man; it is--I really scarce know what;
       But when we hover between fool and sage,
     And don't know justly what we would be at--
       A period something like a printed page,
     Black letter upon foolscap, while our hair
     Grows grizzled, and we are not what we were;--

     Too old for youth,--too young, at thirty-five,
       To herd with boys, or hoard with good threescore,--
     I wonder people should be left alive;
       But since they are, that epoch is a bore:
     Love lingers still, although 't were late to wive;
       And as for other love, the illusion 's o'er;
     And money, that most pure imagination,
     Gleams only through the dawn of its creation.

     O Gold! Why call we misers miserable?
       Theirs is the pleasure that can never pall;
     Theirs is the best bower anchor, the chain cable
       Which holds fast other pleasures great and small.
     Ye who but see the saving man at table,
       And scorn his temperate board, as none at all,
     And wonder how the wealthy can be sparing,
     Know not what visions spring from each cheese-paring.

     Love or lust makes man sick, and wine much sicker;
       Ambition rends, and gaming gains a loss;
     But making money, slowly first, then quicker,
       And adding still a little through each cross
     (Which will come over things), beats love or liquor,
       The gamester's counter, or the statesman's dross.
     O Gold! I still prefer thee unto paper,
     Which makes bank credit like a bank of vapour.

     Who hold the balance of the world? Who reign
       O'er congress, whether royalist or liberal?
     Who rouse the shirtless patriots of Spain?
       (That make old Europe's journals squeak and gibber all.)
     Who keep the world, both old and new, in pain
       Or pleasure? Who make politics run glibber all?
     The shade of Buonaparte's noble daring?-
     Jew Rothschild, and his fellow-Christian, Baring.

     Those, and the truly liberal Lafitte,
       Are the true lords of Europe. Every loan
     Is not a merely speculative hit,
       But seats a nation or upsets a throne.
     Republics also get involved a bit;
       Columbia's stock hath holders not unknown
     On 'Change; and even thy silver soil, Peru,
     Must get itself discounted by a Jew.

     Why call the miser miserable? as
       I said before: the frugal life is his,
     Which in a saint or cynic ever was
       The theme of praise: a hermit would not miss
     Canonization for the self-same cause,
       And wherefore blame gaunt wealth's austerities?
     Because, you 'll say, nought calls for such a trial;--
     Then there 's more merit in his self-denial.

     He is your only poet;--passion, pure
       And sparkling on from heap to heap, displays,
     Possess'd, the ore, of which mere hopes allure
       Nations athwart the deep: the golden rays
     Flash up in ingots from the mine obscure;
       On him the diamond pours its brilliant blaze,
     While the mild emerald's beam shades down the dies
     Of other stones, to soothe the miser's eyes.

     The lands on either side are his; the ship
       From Ceylon, Inde, or far Cathay, unloads
     For him the fragrant produce of each trip;
       Beneath his cars of Ceres groan the roads,
     And the vine blushes like Aurora's lip;
       His very cellars might be kings' abodes;
     While he, despising every sensual call,
     Commands--the intellectual lord of all.

     Perhaps he hath great projects in his mind,
       To build a college, or to found a race,
     A hospital, a church,--and leave behind
       Some dome surmounted by his meagre face:
     Perhaps he fain would liberate mankind
       Even with the very ore which makes them base;
     Perhaps he would be wealthiest of his nation,
     Or revel in the joys of calculation.

     But whether all, or each, or none of these
       May be the hoarder's principle of action,
     The fool will call such mania a disease:--
       What is his own? Go--look at each transaction,
     Wars, revels, loves--do these bring men more ease
       Than the mere plodding through each 'vulgar fraction'?
     Or do they benefit mankind? Lean miser!
     Let spendthrifts' heirs enquire of yours--who 's wiser?

     How beauteous are rouleaus! how charming chests
       Containing ingots, bags of dollars, coins
     (Not of old victors, all whose heads and crests
       Weigh not the thin ore where their visage shines,
     But) of fine unclipt gold, where dully rests
       Some likeness, which the glittering cirque confines,
     Of modern, reigning, sterling, stupid stamp:--
     Yes! ready money is Aladdin's lamp.

     'Love rules the camp, the court, the grove,'--'for love
       Is heaven, and heaven is love:'--so sings the bard;
     Which it were rather difficult to prove
       (A thing with poetry in general hard).
     Perhaps there may be something in 'the grove,'
       At least it rhymes to 'love;' but I 'm prepared
     To doubt (no less than landlords of their rental)
     If 'courts' and 'camps' be quite so sentimental.

     But if Love don't, Cash does, and Cash alone:
       Cash rules the grove, and fells it too besides;
     Without cash, camps were thin, and courts were none;
       Without cash, Malthus tells you--'take no brides.'
     So Cash rules Love the ruler, on his own
       High ground, as virgin Cynthia sways the tides:
     And as for Heaven 'Heaven being Love,' why not say honey
     Is wax? Heaven is not Love, 't is Matrimony.

     Is not all love prohibited whatever,
       Excepting marriage? which is love, no doubt,
     After a sort; but somehow people never
       With the same thought the two words have help'd out:
     Love may exist with marriage, and should ever,
       And marriage also may exist without;
     But love sans bans is both a sin and shame,
     And ought to go by quite another name.

     Now if the 'court,' and 'camp,' and 'grove,' be not
       Recruited all with constant married men,
     Who never coveted their neighbour's lot,
       I say that line 's a lapsus of the pen;--
     Strange too in my 'buon camerado' Scott,
       So celebrated for his morals, when
     My Jeffrey held him up as an example
     To me;--of whom these morals are a sample.

     Well, if I don't succeed, I have succeeded,
       And that 's enough; succeeded in my youth,
     The only time when much success is needed:
       And my success produced what I, in sooth,
     Cared most about; it need not now be pleaded--
       Whate'er it was, 't was mine; I 've paid, in truth,
     Of late the penalty of such success,
     But have not learn'd to wish it any less.

     That suit in Chancery,--which some persons plead
       In an appeal to the unborn, whom they,
     In the faith of their procreative creed,
       Baptize posterity, or future clay,--
     To me seems but a dubious kind of reed
       To lean on for support in any way;
     Since odds are that posterity will know
     No more of them, than they of her, I trow.

     Why, I 'm posterity--and so are you;
       And whom do we remember? Not a hundred.
     Were every memory written down all true,
       The tenth or twentieth name would be but blunder'd;
     Even Plutarch's Lives have but pick'd out a few,
       And 'gainst those few your annalists have thunder'd;
     And Mitford in the nineteenth century
     Gives, with Greek truth, the good old Greek the lie.

     Good people all, of every degree,
       Ye gentle readers and ungentle writers,
     In this twelfth Canto 't is my wish to be
       As serious as if I had for inditers
     Malthus and Wilberforce:--the last set free
       The Negroes and is worth a million fighters;
     While Wellington has but enslaved the Whites,
     And Malthus does the thing 'gainst which he writes.

     I 'm serious--so are all men upon paper;
       And why should I not form my speculation,
     And hold up to the sun my little taper?
       Mankind just now seem wrapt in mediation
     On constitutions and steam-boats of vapour;
       While sages write against all procreation,
     Unless a man can calculate his means
     Of feeding brats the moment his wife weans.

     That 's noble! That 's romantic! For my part,
       I think that 'Philo-genitiveness' is
     (Now here 's a word quite after my own heart,
       Though there 's a shorter a good deal than this,
     If that politeness set it not apart;
       But I 'm resolved to say nought that 's amiss)--
     I say, methinks that 'Philo-genitiveness'
     Might meet from men a little more forgiveness.

     And now to business.--O my gentle Juan,
       Thou art in London--in that pleasant place,
     Where every kind of mischief 's daily brewing,
       Which can await warm youth in its wild race.
     'T is true, that thy career is not a new one;
       Thou art no novice in the headlong chase
     Of early life; but this is a new land,
     Which foreigners can never understand.

     What with a small diversity of climate,
       Of hot or cold, mercurial or sedate,
     I could send forth my mandate like a primate
       Upon the rest of Europe's social state;
     But thou art the most difficult to rhyme at,
       Great Britain, which the Muse may penetrate.
     All countries have their 'Lions,' but in the
     There is but one superb menagerie.

     But I am sick of politics. Begin,
       'Paulo Majora.' Juan, undecided
     Amongst the paths of being 'taken in,'
       Above the ice had like a skater glided:
     When tired of play, he flirted without sin
       With some of those fair creatures who have prided
     Themselves on innocent tantalisation,
     And hate all vice except its reputation.

     But these are few, and in the end they make
       Some devilish escapade or stir, which shows
     That even the purest people may mistake
       Their way through virtue's primrose paths of snows;
     And then men stare, as if a new ass spake
       To Balaam, and from tongue to ear o'erflows
     Quicksilver small talk, ending (if you note it)
     With the kind world's amen--'Who would have thought it?'

     The little Leila, with her orient eyes,
       And taciturn Asiatic disposition
     (Which saw all western things with small surprise,
       To the surprise of people of condition,
     Who think that novelties are butterflies
       To be pursued as food for inanition),
     Her charming figure and romantic history
     Became a kind of fashionable mystery.

     The women much divided--as is usual
       Amongst the sex in little things or great.
     Think not, fair creatures, that I mean to abuse you all--
       I have always liked you better than I state:
     Since I 've grown moral, still I must accuse you all
       Of being apt to talk at a great rate;
     And now there was a general sensation
     Amongst you, about Leila's education.

     In one point only were you settled--and
       You had reason; 't was that a young child of grace,
     As beautiful as her own native land,
       And far away, the last bud of her race,
     Howe'er our friend Don Juan might command
       Himself for five, four, three, or two years' space,
     Would be much better taught beneath the eye
     Of peeresses whose follies had run dry.

     So first there was a generous emulation,
       And then there was a general competition,
     To undertake the orphan's education.
       As Juan was a person of condition,
     It had been an affront on this occasion
       To talk of a subscription or petition;
     But sixteen dowagers, ten unwed she sages,
     Whose tale belongs to 'Hallam's Middle Ages,'

     And one or two sad, separate wives, without
       A fruit to bloom upon their withering bough--
     Begg'd to bring up the little girl and 'out,'-
       For that 's the phrase that settles all things now,
     Meaning a virgin's first blush at a rout,
       And all her points as thorough-bred to show:
     And I assure you, that like virgin honey
     Tastes their first season (mostly if they have money).

     How all the needy honourable misters,
       Each out-at-elbow peer, or desperate dandy,
     The watchful mothers, and the careful sisters
       (Who, by the by, when clever, are more handy
     At making matches, where ''t is gold that glisters,'
       Than their he relatives), like flies o'er candy
     Buzz round 'the Fortune' with their busy battery,
     To turn her head with waltzing and with flattery!

     Each aunt, each cousin, hath her speculation;
       Nay, married dames will now and then discover
     Such pure disinterestedness of passion,
       I 've known them court an heiress for their lover.
     'Tantaene!' Such the virtues of high station,
       Even in the hopeful Isle, whose outlet 's 'Dover!'
     While the poor rich wretch, object of these cares,
     Has cause to wish her sire had had male heirs.

     Some are soon bagg'd, and some reject three dozen.
       'T is fine to see them scattering refusals
     And wild dismay o'er every angry cousin
       (Friends of the party), who begin accusals,
     Such as--'Unless Miss (Blank) meant to have chosen
       Poor Frederick, why did she accord perusals
     To his billets? Why waltz with him? Why, I pray,
     Look yes last night, and yet say no to-day?

     'Why?--Why?--Besides, Fred really was attach'd;
       'T was not her fortune--he has enough without:
     The time will come she 'll wish that she had snatch'd
       So good an opportunity, no doubt:--
     But the old marchioness some plan had hatch'd,
       As I 'll tell Aurea at to-morrow's rout:
     And after all poor Frederick may do better--
     Pray did you see her answer to his letter?'

     Smart uniforms and sparkling coronets
       Are spurn'd in turn, until her turn arrives,
     After male loss of time, and hearts, and bets
       Upon the sweepstakes for substantial wives;
     And when at last the pretty creature gets
       Some gentleman, who fights, or writes, or drives,
     It soothes the awkward squad of the rejected
     To find how very badly she selected.

     For sometimes they accept some long pursuer,
       Worn out with importunity; or fall
     (But here perhaps the instances are fewer)
       To the lot of him who scarce pursued at all.
     A hazy widower turn'd of forty 's sure
       (If 't is not vain examples to recall)
     To draw a high prize: now, howe'er he got her, I
     See nought more strange in this than t' other lottery.

     I, for my part (one 'modern instance' more,
       'True, 't is a pity--pity 't is, 't is true'),
     Was chosen from out an amatory score,
       Albeit my years were less discreet than few;
     But though I also had reform'd before
       Those became one who soon were to be two,
     I 'll not gainsay the generous public's voice,
     That the young lady made a monstrous choice.

     O, pardon my digression--or at least
       Peruse! 'T is always with a moral end
     That I dissert, like grace before a feast:
       For like an aged aunt, or tiresome friend,
     A rigid guardian, or a zealous priest,
       My Muse by exhortation means to mend
     All people, at all times, and in most places,
     Which puts my Pegasus to these grave paces.

     But now I 'm going to be immoral; now
       I mean to show things really as they are,
     Not as they ought to be: for I avow,
       That till we see what 's what in fact, we 're far
     From much improvement with that virtuous plough
       Which skims the surface, leaving scarce a scar
     Upon the black loam long manured by Vice,
     Only to keep its corn at the old price.

     But first of little Leila we 'll dispose;
       For like a day-dawn she was young and pure,
     Or like the old comparison of snows,
       Which are more pure than pleasant to be sure.
     Like many people everybody knows,
       Don Juan was delighted to secure
     A goodly guardian for his infant charge,
     Who might not profit much by being at large.

     Besides, he had found out he was no tutor
       (I wish that others would find out the same);
     And rather wish'd in such things to stand neuter,
       For silly wards will bring their guardians blame:
     So when he saw each ancient dame a suitor
       To make his little wild Asiatic tame,
     Consulting 'the Society for Vice
     Suppression,' Lady Pinchbeck was his choice.

     Olden she was--but had been very young;
       Virtuous she was--and had been, I believe;
     Although the world has such an evil tongue
       That--but my chaster ear will not receive
     An echo of a syllable that 's wrong:
       In fact, there 's nothing makes me so much grieve,
     As that abominable tittle-tattle,
     Which is the cud eschew'd by human cattle.

     Moreover I 've remark'd (and I was once
       A slight observer in a modest way),
     And so may every one except a dunce,
       That ladies in their youth a little gay,
     Besides their knowledge of the world, and sense
       Of the sad consequence of going astray,
     Are wiser in their warnings 'gainst the woe
     Which the mere passionless can never know.

     While the harsh prude indemnifies her virtue
       By railing at the unknown and envied passion,
     Seeking far less to save you than to hurt you,
       Or, what 's still worse, to put you out of fashion,--
     The kinder veteran with calm words will court you,
       Entreating you to pause before you dash on;
     Expounding and illustrating the riddle
     Of epic Love's beginning, end, and middle.

     Now whether it be thus, or that they are stricter,
       As better knowing why they should be so,
     I think you 'll find from many a family picture,
       That daughters of such mothers as may know
     The world by experience rather than by lecture,
       Turn out much better for the Smithfield Show
     Of vestals brought into the marriage mart,
     Than those bred up by prudes without a heart.

     I said that Lady Pinchbeck had been talk'd about--
       As who has not, if female, young, and pretty?
     But now no more the ghost of Scandal stalk'd about;
       She merely was deem'd amiable and witty,
     And several of her best bon-mots were hawk'd about:
       Then she was given to charity and pity,
     And pass'd (at least the latter years of life)
     For being a most exemplary wife.

     High in high circles, gentle in her own,
       She was the mild reprover of the young,
     Whenever--which means every day--they 'd shown
       An awkward inclination to go wrong.
     The quantity of good she did 's unknown,
       Or at the least would lengthen out my song:
     In brief, the little orphan of the East
     Had raised an interest in her, which increased.

     Juan, too, was a sort of favourite with her,
       Because she thought him a good heart at bottom,
     A little spoil'd, but not so altogether;
       Which was a wonder, if you think who got him,
     And how he had been toss'd, he scarce knew whither:
       Though this might ruin others, it did not him,
     At least entirely--for he had seen too many
     Changes in youth, to be surprised at any.

     And these vicissitudes tell best in youth;
       For when they happen at a riper age,
     People are apt to blame the Fates, forsooth,
       And wonder Providence is not more sage.
     Adversity is the first path to truth:
       He who hath proved war, storm, or woman's rage,
     Whether his winters be eighteen or eighty,
     Hath won the experience which is deem'd so weighty.

     How far it profits is another matter.-
       Our hero gladly saw his little charge
     Safe with a lady, whose last grown-up daughter
       Being long married, and thus set at large,
     Had left all the accomplishments she taught her
       To be transmitted, like the Lord Mayor's barge,
     To the next comer; or--as it will tell
     More Muse-like--like to Cytherea's shell.

     I call such things transmission; for there is
       A floating balance of accomplishment
     Which forms a pedigree from Miss to Miss,
       According as their minds or backs are bent.
     Some waltz; some draw; some fathom the abyss
       Of metaphysics; others are content
     With music; the most moderate shine as wits;
     While others have a genius turn'd for fits.

     But whether fits, or wits, or harpsichords,
       Theology, fine arts, or finer stays,
     May be the baits for gentlemen or lords
       With regular descent, in these our days,
     The last year to the new transfers its hoards;
       New vestals claim men's eyes with the same praise
     Of 'elegant' et caetera, in fresh batches--
     All matchless creatures, and yet bent on matches.

     But now I will begin my poem. 'T is
       Perhaps a little strange, if not quite new,
     That from the first of Cantos up to this
       I 've not begun what we have to go through.
     These first twelve books are merely flourishes,
       Preludios, trying just a string or two
     Upon my lyre, or making the pegs sure;
     And when so, you shall have the overture.

     My Muses do not care a pinch of rosin
       About what 's call'd success, or not succeeding:
     Such thoughts are quite below the strain they have chosen;
       'T is a 'great moral lesson' they are reading.
     I thought, at setting off, about two dozen
       Cantos would do; but at Apollo's pleading,
     If that my Pegasus should not be founder'd,
     I think to canter gently through a hundred.

     Don Juan saw that microcosm on stilts,
       Yclept the Great World; for it is the least,
     Although the highest: but as swords have hilts
       By which their power of mischief is increased,
     When man in battle or in quarrel tilts,
       Thus the low world, north, south, or west, or east,
     Must still obey the high--which is their handle,
     Their moon, their sun, their gas, their farthing candle.

     He had many friends who had many wives, and was
       Well look'd upon by both, to that extent
     Of friendship which you may accept or pass,
       It does nor good nor harm being merely meant
     To keep the wheels going of the higher class,
       And draw them nightly when a ticket 's sent:
     And what with masquerades, and fetes, and balls,
     For the first season such a life scarce palls.

     A young unmarried man, with a good name
       And fortune, has an awkward part to play;
     For good society is but a game,
       'The royal game of Goose,' as I may say,
     Where every body has some separate aim,
       An end to answer, or a plan to lay--
     The single ladies wishing to be double,
     The married ones to save the virgins trouble.

     I don't mean this as general, but particular
       Examples may be found of such pursuits:
     Though several also keep their perpendicular
       Like poplars, with good principles for roots;
     Yet many have a method more reticular--
       'Fishers for men,' like sirens with soft lutes:
     For talk six times with the same single lady,
     And you may get the wedding dresses ready.

     Perhaps you 'll have a letter from the mother,
       To say her daughter's feelings are trepann'd;
     Perhaps you 'll have a visit from the brother,
       All strut, and stays, and whiskers, to demand
     What 'your intentions are?'--One way or other
       It seems the virgin's heart expects your hand:
     And between pity for her case and yours,
     You 'll add to Matrimony's list of cures.

     I 've known a dozen weddings made even thus,
       And some of them high names: I have also known
     Young men who--though they hated to discuss
       Pretensions which they never dream'd to have shown--
     Yet neither frighten'd by a female fuss,
       Nor by mustachios moved, were let alone,
     And lived, as did the broken-hearted fair,
     In happier plight than if they form'd a pair.

     There 's also nightly, to the uninitiated,
       A peril--not indeed like love or marriage,
     But not the less for this to be depreciated:
       It is--I meant and mean not to disparage
     The show of virtue even in the vitiated--
       It adds an outward grace unto their carriage--
     But to denounce the amphibious sort of harlot,
     'Couleur de rose,' who 's neither white nor scarlet.

     Such is your cold coquette, who can't say 'No,'
       And won't say 'Yes,' and keeps you on and off-ing
     On a lee-shore, till it begins to blow--
       Then sees your heart wreck'd, with an inward scoffing.
     This works a world of sentimental woe,
       And sends new Werters yearly to their coffin;
     But yet is merely innocent flirtation,
     Not quite adultery, but adulteration.

     'Ye gods, I grow a talker!' Let us prate.
       The next of perils, though I place it sternest,
     Is when, without regard to 'church or state,'
       A wife makes or takes love in upright earnest.
     Abroad, such things decide few women's fate--
       (Such, early traveller! is the truth thou learnest)--
     But in old England, when a young bride errs,
     Poor thing! Eve's was a trifling case to hers.

     For 't is a low, newspaper, humdrum, lawsuit
       Country, where a young couple of the same ages
     Can't form a friendship, but the world o'erawes it.
     A verdict--grievous foe to those who cause it!-
       Forms a sad climax to romantic homages;
     Besides those soothing speeches of the pleaders,
     And evidences which regale all readers.

     But they who blunder thus are raw beginners;
       A little genial sprinkling of hypocrisy
     Has saved the fame of thousand splendid sinners,
       The loveliest oligarchs of our gynocracy;
     You may see such at all the balls and dinners,
       Among the proudest of our aristocracy,
     So gentle, charming, charitable, chaste--
     And all by having tact as well as taste.

     Juan, who did not stand in the predicament
       Of a mere novice, had one safeguard more;
     For he was sick--no, 't was not the word sick I meant--
       But he had seen so much love before,
     That he was not in heart so very weak;--I meant
       But thus much, and no sneer against the shore
     Of white cliffs, white necks, blue eyes, bluer stockings,
     Tithes, taxes, duns, and doors with double knockings.

     But coming young from lands and scenes romantic,
       Where lives, not lawsuits, must be risk'd for Passion,
     And Passion's self must have a spice of frantic,
       Into a country where 't is half a fashion,
     Seem'd to him half commercial, half pedantic,
       Howe'er he might esteem this moral nation:
     Besides (alas! his taste--forgive and pity!)
     At first he did not think the women pretty.

     I say at first--for he found out at last,
       But by degrees, that they were fairer far
     Than the more glowing dames whose lot is cast
       Beneath the influence of the eastern star.
     A further proof we should not judge in haste;
       Yet inexperience could not be his bar
     To taste:--the truth is, if men would confess,
     That novelties please less than they impress.

     Though travell'd, I have never had the luck to
       Trace up those shuffling negroes, Nile or Niger,
     To that impracticable place, Timbuctoo,
       Where Geography finds no one to oblige her
     With such a chart as may be safely stuck to--
       For Europe ploughs in Afric like 'bos piger:'
     But if I had been at Timbuctoo, there
     No doubt I should be told that black is fair.

     It is. I will not swear that black is white;
       But I suspect in fact that white is black,
     And the whole matter rests upon eyesight.
       Ask a blind man, the best judge. You 'll attack
     Perhaps this new position--but I 'm right;
       Or if I 'm wrong, I 'll not be ta'en aback:--
     He hath no morn nor night, but all is dark
     Within; and what seest thou? A dubious spark.

     But I 'm relapsing into metaphysics,
       That labyrinth, whose clue is of the same
     Construction as your cures for hectic phthisics,
       Those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame;
     And this reflection brings me to plain physics,
       And to the beauties of a foreign dame,
     Compared with those of our pure pearls of price,
     Those polar summers, all sun, and some ice.

     Or say they are like virtuous mermaids, whose
       Beginnings are fair faces, ends mere fishes;--
     Not that there 's not a quantity of those
       Who have a due respect for their own wishes.
     Like Russians rushing from hot baths to snows
       Are they, at bottom virtuous even when vicious:
     They warm into a scrape, but keep of course,
     As a reserve, a plunge into remorse.

     But this has nought to do with their outsides.
       I said that Juan did not think them pretty
     At the first blush; for a fair Briton hides
       Half her attractions--probably from pity--
     And rather calmly into the heart glides,
       Than storms it as a foe would take a city;
     But once there (if you doubt this, prithee try)
     She keeps it for you like a true ally.

     She cannot step as does an Arab barb,
       Or Andalusian girl from mass returning,
     Nor wear as gracefully as Gauls her garb,
       Nor in her eye Ausonia's glance is burning;
     Her voice, though sweet, is not so fit to warb--
       le those bravuras (which I still am learning
     To like, though I have been seven years in Italy,
     And have, or had, an ear that served me prettily);--

     She cannot do these things, nor one or two
       Others, in that off-hand and dashing style
     Which takes so much--to give the devil his due;
       Nor is she quite so ready with her smile,
     Nor settles all things in one interview
       (A thing approved as saving time and toil);--
     But though the soil may give you time and trouble,
     Well cultivated, it will render double.

     And if in fact she takes to a 'grande passion,'
       It is a very serious thing indeed:
     Nine times in ten 't is but caprice or fashion,
       Coquetry, or a wish to take the lead,
     The pride of a mere child with a new sash on,
       Or wish to make a rival's bosom bleed:
     But the tenth instance will be a tornado,
     For there 's no saying what they will or may do.

     The reason 's obvious; if there 's an eclat,
       They lose their caste at once, as do the Parias;
     And when the delicacies of the law
       Have fill'd their papers with their comments various,
     Society, that china without flaw
       (The hypocrite!), will banish them like Marius,
     To sit amidst the ruins of their guilt:
     For Fame 's a Carthage not so soon rebuilt.

     Perhaps this is as it should be;--it is
       A comment on the Gospel's 'Sin no more,
     And be thy sins forgiven:'--but upon this
       I leave the saints to settle their own score.
     Abroad, though doubtless they do much amiss,
       An erring woman finds an opener door
     For her return to Virtue--as they cal
     That lady, who should be at home to all.

     For me, I leave the matter where I find it,
       Knowing that such uneasy virtue leads
     People some ten times less in fact to mind it,
       And care but for discoveries and not deeds.
     And as for chastity, you 'll never bind it
       By all the laws the strictest lawyer pleads,
     But aggravate the crime you have not prevented,
     By rendering desperate those who had else repented.

     But Juan was no casuist, nor had ponder'd
       Upon the moral lessons of mankind:
     Besides, he had not seen of several hundred
       A lady altogether to his mind.
     A little 'blase'--'t is not to be wonder'd
       At, that his heart had got a tougher rind:
     And though not vainer from his past success,
     No doubt his sensibilities were less.

     He also had been busy seeing sights--
       The Parliament and all the other houses;
     Had sat beneath the gallery at nights,
       To hear debates whose thunder roused (not rouses)
     The world to gaze upon those northern lights
       Which flash'd as far as where the musk-bull browses;
     He had also stood at times behind the throne--
     But Grey was not arrived, and Chatham gone.

     He saw, however, at the closing session,
       That noble sight, when really free the nation,
     A king in constitutional possession
       Of such a throne as is the proudest station,
     Though despots know it not--till the progression
       Of freedom shall complete their education.
     'T is not mere splendour makes the show august
     To eye or heart--it is the people's trust.

     There, too, he saw (whate'er he may be now)
       A Prince, the prince of princes at the time,
     With fascination in his very bow,
       And full of promise, as the spring of prime.
     Though royalty was written on his brow,
       He had then the grace, too, rare in every clime,
     Of being, without alloy of fop or beau,
     A finish'd gentleman from top to toe.

     And Juan was received, as hath been said,
       Into the best society: and there
     Occurr'd what often happens, I 'm afraid,
       However disciplined and debonnaire:--
     The talent and good humour he display'd,
       Besides the mark'd distinction of his air,
     Exposed him, as was natural, to temptation,
     Even though himself avoided the occasion.

     But what, and where, with whom, and when, and why,
       Is not to be put hastily together;
     And as my object is morality
       (Whatever people say), I don't know whether
     I 'll leave a single reader's eyelid dry,
       But harrow up his feelings till they wither,
     And hew out a huge monument of pathos,
     As Philip's son proposed to do with Athos.

     Here the twelfth Canto of our introduction
       Ends. When the body of the book 's begun,
     You 'll find it of a different construction
       From what some people say 't will be when done:
     The plan at present 's simply in concoction,
       I can't oblige you, reader, to read on;
     That 's your affair, not mine: a real spirit
     Should neither court neglect, nor dread to bear it.

     And if my thunderbolt not always rattles,
       Remember, reader! you have had before
     The worst of tempests and the best of battles
       That e'er were brew'd from elements or gore,
     Besides the most sublime of--Heaven knows what else:
       An usurer could scarce expect much more--
     But my best canto, save one on astronomy,
     Will turn upon 'political economy.'

     That is your present theme for popularity:
       Now that the public hedge hath scarce a stake,
     It grows an act of patriotic charity,
       To show the people the best way to break.
     My plan (but I, if but for singularity,
       Reserve it) will be very sure to take.
     Meantime, read all the national debt-sinkers,
     And tell me what you think of your great thinkers.


[Illustration: Canto 13]




CANTO THE THIRTEENTH.

     I now mean to be serious;--it is time,
       Since laughter now-a-days is deem'd too serious.
     A jest at Vice by Virtue 's call'd a crime,
       And critically held as deleterious:
     Besides, the sad 's a source of the sublime,
       Although when long a little apt to weary us;
     And therefore shall my lay soar high and solemn,
     As an old temple dwindled to a column.

     The Lady Adeline Amundeville
       ('Tis an old Norman name, and to be found
     In pedigrees, by those who wander still
       Along the last fields of that Gothic ground)
     Was high-born, wealthy by her father's will,
       And beauteous, even where beauties most abound,
     In Britain--which of course true patriots find
     The goodliest soil of body and of mind.

     I 'll not gainsay them; it is not my cue;
       I 'll leave them to their taste, no doubt the best:
     An eye 's an eye, and whether black or blue,
       Is no great matter, so 't is in request,
     'T is nonsense to dispute about a hue--
       The kindest may be taken as a test.
     The fair sex should be always fair; and no man,
     Till thirty, should perceive there 's a plain woman.

     And after that serene and somewhat dull
       Epoch, that awkward corner turn'd for days
     More quiet, when our moon 's no more at full,
       We may presume to criticise or praise;
     Because indifference begins to lull
       Our passions, and we walk in wisdom's ways;
     Also because the figure and the face
     Hint, that 't is time to give the younger place.

     I know that some would fain postpone this era,
       Reluctant as all placemen to resign
     Their post; but theirs is merely a chimera,
       For they have pass'd life's equinoctial line:
     But then they have their claret and Madeira
       To irrigate the dryness of decline;
     And county meetings, and the parliament,
     And debt, and what not, for their solace sent.

     And is there not religion, and reform,
       Peace, war, the taxes, and what 's call'd the 'Nation'?
     The struggle to be pilots in a storm?
       The landed and the monied speculation?
     The joys of mutual hate to keep them warm,
       Instead of love, that mere hallucination?
     Now hatred is by far the longest pleasure;
     Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.

     Rough Johnson, the great moralist, profess'd,
       Right honestly, 'he liked an honest hater!'-
     The only truth that yet has been confest
       Within these latest thousand years or later.
     Perhaps the fine old fellow spoke in jest:--
       For my part, I am but a mere spectator,
     And gaze where'er the palace or the hovel is,
     Much in the mode of Goethe's Mephistopheles;

     But neither love nor hate in much excess;
       Though 't was not once so. If I sneer sometimes,
     It is because I cannot well do less,
       And now and then it also suits my rhymes.
     I should be very willing to redress
       Men's wrongs, and rather check than punish crimes,
     Had not Cervantes, in that too true tale
     Of Quixote, shown how all such efforts fail.

     Of all tales 't is the saddest--and more sad,
       Because it makes us smile: his hero 's right,
     And still pursues the right;--to curb the bad
       His only object, and 'gainst odds to fight
     His guerdon: 't is his virtue makes him mad!
       But his adventures form a sorry sight;
     A sorrier still is the great moral taught
     By that real epic unto all who have thought.

     Redressing injury, revenging wrong,
       To aid the damsel and destroy the caitiff;
     Opposing singly the united strong,
       From foreign yoke to free the helpless native:--
     Alas! must noblest views, like an old song,
       Be for mere fancy's sport a theme creative,
     A jest, a riddle, Fame through thin and thick sought!
     And Socrates himself but Wisdom's Quixote?

     Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away;
       A single laugh demolish'd the right arm
     Of his own country;--seldom since that day
       Has Spain had heroes. While Romance could charm,
     The world gave ground before her bright array;
       And therefore have his volumes done such harm,
     That all their glory, as a composition,
     Was dearly purchased by his land's perdition.

     I 'm 'at my old lunes'--digression, and forget
       The Lady Adeline Amundeville;
     The fair most fatal Juan ever met,
       Although she was not evil nor meant ill;
     But Destiny and Passion spread the net
       (Fate is a good excuse for our own will),
     And caught them;--what do they not catch, methinks?
     But I 'm not OEdipus, and life 's a Sphinx.

     I tell the tale as it is told, nor dare
       To venture a solution: 'Davus sum!'
     And now I will proceed upon the pair.
       Sweet Adeline, amidst the gay world's hum,
     Was the Queen-Bee, the glass of all that 's fair;
       Whose charms made all men speak, and women dumb.
     The last 's a miracle, and such was reckon'd,
     And since that time there has not been a second.

     Chaste was she, to detraction's desperation,
       And wedded unto one she had loved well--
     A man known in the councils of the nation,
       Cool, and quite English, imperturbable,
     Though apt to act with fire upon occasion,
       Proud of himself and her: the world could tell
     Nought against either, and both seem'd secure--
     She in her virtue, he in his hauteur.

     It chanced some diplomatical relations,
       Arising out of business, often brought
     Himself and Juan in their mutual stations
       Into close contact. Though reserved, nor caught
     By specious seeming, Juan's youth, and patience,
       And talent, on his haughty spirit wrought,
     And form'd a basis of esteem, which ends
     In making men what courtesy calls friends.

     And thus Lord Henry, who was cautious as
       Reserve and pride could make him, and full slow
     In judging men--when once his judgment was
       Determined, right or wrong, on friend or foe,
     Had all the pertinacity pride has,
       Which knows no ebb to its imperious flow,
     And loves or hates, disdaining to be guided,
     Because its own good pleasure hath decided.

     His friendships, therefore, and no less aversions,
       Though oft well founded, which confirm'd but more
     His prepossessions, like the laws of Persians
       And Medes, would ne'er revoke what went before.
     His feelings had not those strange fits, like tertians,
       Of common likings, which make some deplore
     What they should laugh at--the mere ague still
     Of men's regard, the fever or the chill.

     ''T is not in mortals to command success:
       But do you more, Sempronius--don't deserve it,'
     And take my word, you won't have any less.
       Be wary, watch the time, and always serve it;
     Give gently way, when there 's too great a press;
       And for your conscience, only learn to nerve it,
     For, like a racer, or a boxer training,
     'T will make, if proved, vast efforts without paining.

     Lord Henry also liked to be superior,
       As most men do, the little or the great;
     The very lowest find out an inferior,
       At least they think so, to exert their state
     Upon: for there are very few things wearier
       Than solitary Pride's oppressive weight,
     Which mortals generously would divide,
     By bidding others carry while they ride.

     In birth, in rank, in fortune likewise equal,
       O'er Juan he could no distinction claim;
     In years he had the advantage of time's sequel;
       And, as he thought, in country much the same--
     Because bold Britons have a tongue and free quill,
       At which all modern nations vainly aim;
     And the Lord Henry was a great debater,
     So that few members kept the house up later.

     These were advantages: and then he thought--
       It was his foible, but by no means sinister--
     That few or none more than himself had caught
       Court mysteries, having been himself a minister:
     He liked to teach that which he had been taught,
       And greatly shone whenever there had been a stir;
     And reconciled all qualities which grace man,
     Always a patriot, and sometimes a placeman.

     He liked the gentle Spaniard for his gravity;
       He almost honour'd him for his docility;
     Because, though young, he acquiesced with suavity,
       Or contradicted but with proud humility.
     He knew the world, and would not see depravity
       In faults which sometimes show the soil's fertility,
     If that the weeds o'erlive not the first crop--
     For then they are very difficult to stop.

     And then he talk'd with him about Madrid,
       Constantinople, and such distant places;
     Where people always did as they were bid,
       Or did what they should not with foreign graces.
     Of coursers also spake they: Henry rid
       Well, like most Englishmen, and loved the races;
     And Juan, like a true-born Andalusian,
     Could back a horse, as despots ride a Russian.

     And thus acquaintance grew, at noble routs,
       And diplomatic dinners, or at other--
     For Juan stood well both with Ins and Outs,
       As in freemasonry a higher brother.
     Upon his talent Henry had no doubts;
       His manner show'd him sprung from a high mother;
     And all men like to show their hospitality
     To him whose breeding matches with his quality.

     At Blank-Blank Square;--for we will break no squares
       By naming streets: since men are so censorious,
     And apt to sow an author's wheat with tares,
       Reaping allusions private and inglorious,
     Where none were dreamt of, unto love's affairs,
       Which were, or are, or are to be notorious,
     That therefore do I previously declare,
     Lord Henry's mansion was in Blank-Blank Square.

     Also there bin another pious reason
       For making squares and streets anonymous;
     Which is, that there is scarce a single season
       Which doth not shake some very splendid house
     With some slight heart-quake of domestic treason--
       A topic scandal doth delight to rouse:
     Such I might stumble over unawares,
     Unless I knew the very chastest squares.

     'T is true, I might have chosen Piccadilly,
       A place where peccadillos are unknown;
     But I have motives, whether wise or silly,
       For letting that pure sanctuary alone.
     Therefore I name not square, street, place, until I
       Find one where nothing naughty can be shown,
     A vestal shrine of innocence of heart:

     At Henry's mansion then, in Blank-Blank Square,
       Was Juan a recherche, welcome guest,
     As many other noble scions were;
       And some who had but talent for their crest;
     Or wealth, which is a passport every where;
       Or even mere fashion, which indeed 's the best
     Recommendation; and to be well drest
     Will very often supersede the rest.

     And since 'there 's safety in a multitude
       Of counsellors,' as Solomon has said,
     Or some one for him, in some sage, grave mood;--
       Indeed we see the daily proof display'd
     In senates, at the bar, in wordy feud,
       Where'er collective wisdom can parade,
     Which is the only cause that we can guess
     Of Britain's present wealth and happiness;--

     But as 'there 's safety' grafted in the number
       'Of counsellors' for men, thus for the sex
     A large acquaintance lets not Virtue slumber;
       Or should it shake, the choice will more perplex--
     Variety itself will more encumber.
       'Midst many rocks we guard more against wrecks;
     And thus with women: howsoe'er it shocks some's
     Self-love, there 's safety in a crowd of coxcombs.

     But Adeline had not the least occasion
       For such a shield, which leaves but little merit
     To virtue proper, or good education.
       Her chief resource was in her own high spirit,
     Which judged mankind at their due estimation;
       And for coquetry, she disdain'd to wear it:
     Secure of admiration, its impression
     Was faint, as of an every-day possession.

     To all she was polite without parade;
       To some she show'd attention of that kind
     Which flatters, but is flattery convey'd
       In such a sort as cannot leave behind
     A trace unworthy either wife or maid;--
       A gentle, genial courtesy of mind,
     To those who were, or pass'd for meritorious,
     Just to console sad glory for being glorious;

     Which is in all respects, save now and then,
       A dull and desolate appendage. Gaze
     Upon the shades of those distinguish'd men
       Who were or are the puppet-shows of praise,
     The praise of persecution; gaze again
       On the most favour'd; and amidst the blaze
     Of sunset halos o'er the laurel-brow'd,
     What can ye recognise?--a gilded cloud.

     There also was of course in Adeline
       That calm patrician polish in the address,
     Which ne'er can pass the equinoctial line
       Of any thing which nature would express;
     Just as a mandarin finds nothing fine,--
       At least his manner suffers not to guess
     That any thing he views can greatly please.
     Perhaps we have borrow'd this from the Chinese--

     Perhaps from Horace: his 'Nil admirari'
       Was what he call'd the 'Art of Happiness;'
     An art on which the artists greatly vary,
       And have not yet attain'd to much success.
     However, 't is expedient to be wary:
       Indifference certes don't produce distress;
     And rash enthusiasm in good society
     Were nothing but a moral inebriety.

     But Adeline was not indifferent: for
       (Now for a common-place!) beneath the snow,
     As a volcano holds the lava more
       Within--et caetera. Shall I go on?--No!
     I hate to hunt down a tired metaphor,
       So let the often-used volcano go.
     Poor thing! How frequently, by me and others,
     It hath been stirr'd up till its smoke quite smothers!

     I 'll have another figure in a trice:--
       What say you to a bottle of champagne?
     Frozen into a very vinous ice,
       Which leaves few drops of that immortal rain,
     Yet in the very centre, past all price,
       About a liquid glassful will remain;
     And this is stronger than the strongest grape
     Could e'er express in its expanded shape:

     'T is the whole spirit brought to a quintessence;
       And thus the chilliest aspects may concentre
     A hidden nectar under a cold presence.
       And such are many--though I only meant her
     From whom I now deduce these moral lessons,
       On which the Muse has always sought to enter.
     And your cold people are beyond all price,
     When once you have broken their confounded ice.

     But after all they are a North-West Passage
       Unto the glowing India of the soul;
     And as the good ships sent upon that message
       Have not exactly ascertain'd the Pole
     (Though Parry's efforts look a lucky presage),
       Thus gentlemen may run upon a shoal;
     For if the Pole 's not open, but all frost
     (A chance still), 't is a voyage or vessel lost.

     And young beginners may as well commence
       With quiet cruising o'er the ocean woman;
     While those who are not beginners should have sense
       Enough to make for port, ere time shall summon
     With his grey signal-flag; and the past tense,
       The dreary 'Fuimus' of all things human,
     Must be declined, while life's thin thread 's spun out
     Between the gaping heir and gnawing gout.

     But heaven must be diverted; its diversion
       Is sometimes truculent--but never mind:
     The world upon the whole is worth the assertion
       (If but for comfort) that all things are kind:
     And that same devilish doctrine of the Persian,
       Of the two principles, but leaves behind
     As many doubts as any other doctrine
     Has ever puzzled Faith withal, or yoked her in.

     The English winter--ending in July,
       To recommence in August--now was done.
     'T is the postilion's paradise: wheels fly;
       On roads, east, south, north, west, there is a run.
     But for post-horses who finds sympathy?
       Man's pity 's for himself, or for his son,
     Always premising that said son at college
     Has not contracted much more debt than knowledge.

     The London winter 's ended in July--
       Sometimes a little later. I don't err
     In this: whatever other blunders lie
       Upon my shoulders, here I must aver
     My Muse a glass of weatherology;
       For parliament is our barometer:
     Let radicals its other acts attack,
     Its sessions form our only almanack.

     When its quicksilver 's down at zero,--lo
       Coach, chariot, luggage, baggage, equipage!
     Wheels whirl from Carlton palace to Soho,
       And happiest they who horses can engage;
     The turnpikes glow with dust; and Rotten Row
       Sleeps from the chivalry of this bright age;
     And tradesmen, with long bills and longer faces,
     Sigh--as the postboys fasten on the traces.

     They and their bills, 'Arcadians both,' are left
       To the Greek kalends of another session.
     Alas! to them of ready cash bereft,
       What hope remains? Of hope the full possession,
     Or generous draft, conceded as a gift,
       At a long date--till they can get a fresh one--
     Hawk'd about at a discount, small or large;
     Also the solace of an overcharge.

     But these are trifles. Downward flies my lord,
       Nodding beside my lady in his carriage.
     Away! away! 'Fresh horses!' are the word,
       And changed as quickly as hearts after marriage;
     The obsequious landlord hath the change restored;
       The postboys have no reason to disparage
     Their fee; but ere the water'd wheels may hiss hence,
     The ostler pleads too for a reminiscence.

     'T is granted; and the valet mounts the dickey--
       That gentleman of lords and gentlemen;
     Also my lady's gentlewoman, tricky,
       Trick'd out, but modest more than poet's pen
     Can paint,--'Cosi viaggino i Ricchi!'
       (Excuse a foreign slipslop now and then,
     If but to show I 've travell'd; and what 's travel,
     Unless it teaches one to quote and cavil?)

     The London winter and the country summer
       Were well nigh over. 'T is perhaps a pity,
     When nature wears the gown that doth become her,
       To lose those best months in a sweaty city,
     And wait until the nightingale grows dumber,
       Listening debates not very wise or witty,
     Ere patriots their true country can remember;--
     But there 's no shooting (save grouse) till September.

     I 've done with my tirade. The world was gone;
       The twice two thousand, for whom earth was made,
     Were vanish'd to be what they call alone--
       That is, with thirty servants for parade,
     As many guests, or more; before whom groan
       As many covers, duly, daily, laid.
     Let none accuse Old England's hospitality--
     Its quantity is but condensed to quality.

     Lord Henry and the Lady Adeline
       Departed like the rest of their compeers,
     The peerage, to a mansion very fine;
       The Gothic Babel of a thousand years.
     None than themselves could boast a longer line,
       Where time through heroes and through beauties steers;
     And oaks as olden as their pedigree
     Told of their sires, a tomb in every tree.

     A paragraph in every paper told
       Of their departure: such is modern fame:
     'T is pity that it takes no farther hold
       Than an advertisement, or much the same;
     When, ere the ink be dry, the sound grows cold.
       The Morning Post was foremost to proclaim--
     'Departure, for his country seat, to-day,
     Lord H. Amundeville and Lady A.

     'We understand the splendid host intends
       To entertain, this autumn, a select
     And numerous party of his noble friends;
       'Midst whom we have heard, from sources quite correct,
       With many more by rank and fashion deck'd;
     Also a foreigner of high condition,
     The envoy of the secret Russian mission.'

     And thus we see--who doubts the Morning Post?
       (Whose articles are like the 'Thirty-nine,'
     Which those most swear to who believe them most)--
       Our gay Russ Spaniard was ordain'd to shine,
     Deck'd by the rays reflected from his host,
       With those who, Pope says, 'greatly daring dine.'
     'T is odd, but true,--last war the News abounded
     More with these dinners than the kill'd or wounded;--

     As thus: 'On Thursday there was a grand dinner;
       Present, Lords A. B. C.'--Earls, dukes, by name
     Announced with no less pomp than victory's winner:
       Then underneath, and in the very same
     Column; date, 'Falmouth. There has lately been here
       The Slap-dash regiment, so well known to fame,
     Whose loss in the late action we regret:
     The vacancies are fill'd up--see Gazette.'

     To Norman Abbey whirl'd the noble pair,--
       An old, old monastery once, and now
     Still older mansion; of a rich and rare
       Mix'd Gothic, such as artists all allow
     Few specimens yet left us can compare
       Withal: it lies perhaps a little low,
     Because the monks preferr'd a hill behind,
     To shelter their devotion from the wind.

     It stood embosom'd in a happy valley,
       Crown'd by high woodlands, where the Druid oak
     Stood like Caractacus in act to rally
       His host, with broad arms 'gainst the thunderstroke;
     And from beneath his boughs were seen to sally
       The dappled foresters--as day awoke,
     The branching stag swept down with all his herd,
     To quaff a brook which murmur'd like a bird.

     Before the mansion lay a lucid lake,
       Broad as transparent, deep, and freshly fed
     By a river, which its soften'd way did take
       In currents through the calmer water spread
     Around: the wildfowl nestled in the brake
       And sedges, brooding in their liquid bed:
     The woods sloped downwards to its brink, and stood
     With their green faces fix'd upon the flood.

     Its outlet dash'd into a deep cascade,
       Sparkling with foam, until again subsiding,
     Its shriller echoes--like an infant made
       Quiet--sank into softer ripples, gliding
     Into a rivulet; and thus allay'd,
       Pursued its course, now gleaming, and now hiding
     Its windings through the woods; now clear, now blue,
     According as the skies their shadows threw.

     A glorious remnant of the Gothic pile
       (While yet the church was Rome's) stood half apart
     In a grand arch, which once screen'd many an aisle.
       These last had disappear'd--a loss to art:
     The first yet frown'd superbly o'er the soil,
       And kindled feelings in the roughest heart,
     Which mourn'd the power of time's or tempest's march,
     In gazing on that venerable arch.

     Within a niche, nigh to its pinnacle,
       Twelve saints had once stood sanctified in stone;
     But these had fallen, not when the friars fell,
       But in the war which struck Charles from his throne,
     When each house was a fortalice, as tell
       The annals of full many a line undone,--
     The gallant cavaliers, who fought in vain
     For those who knew not to resign or reign.

     But in a higher niche, alone, but crowned,
       The Virgin Mother of the God-born Child,
     With her Son in her blessed arms, look'd round,
       Spared by some chance when all beside was spoil'd;
     She made the earth below seem holy ground.
       This may be superstition, weak or wild,
     But even the faintest relics of a shrine
     Of any worship wake some thoughts divine.

     A mighty window, hollow in the centre,
       Shorn of its glass of thousand colourings,
     Through which the deepen'd glories once could enter,
       Streaming from off the sun like seraph's wings,
     Now yawns all desolate: now loud, now fainter,
       The gale sweeps through its fretwork, and oft sings
     The owl his anthem, where the silenced quire
     Lie with their hallelujahs quench'd like fire.

     But in the noontide of the moon, and when
       The wind is winged from one point of heaven,
     There moans a strange unearthly sound, which then
       Is musical--a dying accent driven
     Through the huge arch, which soars and sinks again.
       Some deem it but the distant echo given
     Back to the night wind by the waterfall,
     And harmonised by the old choral wall:

     Others, that some original shape, or form
       Shaped by decay perchance, hath given the power
     (Though less than that of Memnon's statue, warm
       In Egypt's rays, to harp at a fix'd hour)
     To this grey ruin, with a voice to charm.
       Sad, but serene, it sweeps o'er tree or tower;
     The cause I know not, nor can solve; but such
     The fact:--I 've heard it--once perhaps too much.

     Amidst the court a Gothic fountain play'd,
       Symmetrical, but deck'd with carvings quaint--
     Strange faces, like to men in masquerade,
       And here perhaps a monster, there a saint:
     The spring gush'd through grim mouths of granite made,
       And sparkled into basins, where it spent
     Its little torrent in a thousand bubbles,
     Like man's vain glory, and his vainer troubles.

     The mansion's self was vast and venerable,
       With more of the monastic than has been
     Elsewhere preserved: the cloisters still were stable,
       The cells, too, and refectory, I ween:
     An exquisite small chapel had been able,
       Still unimpair'd, to decorate the scene;
     The rest had been reform'd, replaced, or sunk,
     And spoke more of the baron than the monk.

     Huge halls, long galleries, spacious chambers, join'd
       By no quite lawful marriage of the arts,
     Might shock a connoisseur; but when combined,
       Form'd a whole which, irregular in parts,
     Yet left a grand impression on the mind,
       At least of those whose eyes are in their hearts:
     We gaze upon a giant for his stature,
     Nor judge at first if all be true to nature.

     Steel barons, molten the next generation
       To silken rows of gay and garter'd earls,
     Glanced from the walls in goodly preservation;
       And Lady Marys blooming into girls,
     With fair long locks, had also kept their station;
       And countesses mature in robes and pearls:
     Also some beauties of Sir Peter Lely,
     Whose drapery hints we may admire them freely.

     Judges in very formidable ermine
       Were there, with brows that did not much invite
     The accused to think their lordships would determine
       His cause by leaning much from might to right:
     Bishops, who had not left a single sermon:
       Attorneys-general, awful to the sight,
     As hinting more (unless our judgments warp us)
     Of the 'Star Chamber' than of 'Habeas Corpus.'

     Generals, some all in armour, of the old
       And iron time, ere lead had ta'en the lead;
     Others in wigs of Marlborough's martial fold,
       Huger than twelve of our degenerate breed:
     Lordlings, with staves of white or keys of gold:
       Nimrods, whose canvass scarce contain'd the steed;
     And here and there some stern high patriot stood,
     Who could not get the place for which he sued.

     But ever and anon, to soothe your vision,
       Fatigued with these hereditary glories,
     There rose a Carlo Dolce or a Titian,
       Or wilder group of savage Salvatore's;
     Here danced Albano's boys, and here the sea shone
       In Vernet's ocean lights; and there the stories
     Of martyrs awed, as Spagnoletto tainted
     His brush with all the blood of all the sainted.

     Here sweetly spread a landscape of Lorraine;
       There Rembrandt made his darkness equal light,
     Or gloomy Caravaggio's gloomier stain
       Bronzed o'er some lean and stoic anchorite:--
     But, lo! a Teniers woos, and not in vain,
       Your eyes to revel in a livelier sight:
     His bell-mouth'd goblet makes me feel quite Danish
     Or Dutch with thirst--What, ho! a flask of Rhenish.

     O reader! if that thou canst read,--and know,
       'T is not enough to spell, or even to read,
     To constitute a reader; there must go
       Virtues of which both you and I have need;--
     Firstly, begin with the beginning (though
       That clause is hard); and secondly, proceed;
     Thirdly, commence not with the end--or, sinning
     In this sort, end at least with the beginning.

     But, reader, thou hast patient been of late,
       While I, without remorse of rhyme, or fear,
     Have built and laid out ground at such a rate,
       Dan Phoebus takes me for an auctioneer.
     That poets were so from their earliest date,
       By Homer's 'Catalogue of ships' is clear;
     But a mere modern must be moderate--
     I spare you then the furniture and plate.

     The mellow autumn came, and with it came
       The promised party, to enjoy its sweets.
     The corn is cut, the manor full of game;
       The pointer ranges, and the sportsman beats
     In russet jacket:--lynx-like is his aim;
       Full grows his bag, and wonderful his feats.
     Ah, nut-brown partridges! Ah, brilliant pheasants!
     And ah, ye poachers!--'T is no sport for peasants.

     An English autumn, though it hath no vines,
       Blushing with Bacchant coronals along
     The paths, o'er which the far festoon entwines
       The red grape in the sunny lands of song,
     Hath yet a purchased choice of choicest wines;
       The claret light, and the Madeira strong.
     If Britain mourn her bleakness, we can tell her,
     The very best of vineyards is the cellar.

     Then, if she hath not that serene decline
       Which makes the southern autumn's day appear
     As if 't would to a second spring resign
       The season, rather than to winter drear,
     Of in-door comforts still she hath a mine,--
       The sea-coal fires the 'earliest of the year;'
     Without doors, too, she may compete in mellow,
     As what is lost in green is gain'd in yellow.

     And for the effeminate villeggiatura--
       Rife with more horns than hounds--she hath the chase,
     So animated that it might allure
       Saint from his beads to join the jocund race;
     Even Nimrod's self might leave the plains of Dura,
       And wear the Melton jacket for a space:
     If she hath no wild boars, she hath a tame
     Preserve of bores, who ought to be made game.

     The noble guests, assembled at the Abbey,
       Consisted of--we give the sex the pas--
     The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke; the Countess Crabby;
       The Ladies Scilly, Busey;--Miss Eclat,
     Miss Bombazeen, Miss Mackstay, Miss O'Tabby,
       And Mrs. Rabbi, the rich banker's squaw;
     Also the honourable Mrs. Sleep,
     Who look'd a white lamb, yet was a black sheep:

     With other Countesses of Blank--but rank;
       At once the 'lie' and the 'elite' of crowds;
     Who pass like water filter'd in a tank,
       All purged and pious from their native clouds;
     Or paper turn'd to money by the Bank:
       No matter how or why, the passport shrouds
     The 'passee' and the past; for good society
     Is no less famed for tolerance than piety,--

     That is, up to a certain point; which point
       Forms the most difficult in punctuation.
     Appearances appear to form the joint
       On which it hinges in a higher station;
     And so that no explosion cry 'Aroint
       Thee, witch!' or each Medea has her Jason;
     Or (to the point with Horace and with Pulci)
     'Omne tulit punctum, quae miscuit utile dulci.'

     I can't exactly trace their rule of right,
       Which hath a little leaning to a lottery.
     I 've seen a virtuous woman put down quite
       By the mere combination of a coterie;
     Also a so-so matron boldly fight
       Her way back to the world by dint of plottery,
     And shine the very Siria of the spheres,
     Escaping with a few slight, scarless sneers.

     I have seen more than I 'll say:--but we will see
       How our villeggiatura will get on.
     The party might consist of thirty-three
       Of highest caste--the Brahmins of the ton.
     I have named a few, not foremost in degree,
       But ta'en at hazard as the rhyme may run.
     By way of sprinkling, scatter'd amongst these,
     There also were some Irish absentees.

     There was Parolles, too, the legal bully,
       Who limits all his battles to the bar
     And senate: when invited elsewhere, truly,
       He shows more appetite for words than war.
     There was the young bard Rackrhyme, who had newly
       Come out and glimmer'd as a six weeks' star.
     There was Lord Pyrrho, too, the great freethinker;
     And Sir John Pottledeep, the mighty drinker.

     There was the Duke of Dash, who was a--duke,
       'Ay, every inch a' duke; there were twelve peers
     Like Charlemagne's--and all such peers in look
       And intellect, that neither eyes nor ears
     For commoners had ever them mistook.
       There were the six Miss Rawbolds--pretty dears!
     All song and sentiment; whose hearts were set
     Less on a convent than a coronet.

     There were four Honourable Misters, whose
       Honour was more before their names than after;
     There was the preux Chevalier de la Ruse,
       Whom France and Fortune lately deign'd to waft here,
     Whose chiefly harmless talent was to amuse;
       But the clubs found it rather serious laughter,
     Because--such was his magic power to please--
     The dice seem'd charm'd, too, with his repartees.

     There was Dick Dubious, the metaphysician,
       Who loved philosophy and a good dinner;
     Angle, the soi-disant mathematician;
       Sir Henry Silvercup, the great race-winner.
     There was the Reverend Rodomont Precisian,
       Who did not hate so much the sin as sinner;
     And Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet,
     Good at all things, but better at a bet.

     There was jack jargon, the gigantic guardsman;
       And General Fireface, famous in the field,
     A great tactician, and no less a swordsman,
       Who ate, last war, more Yankees than he kill'd.
     There was the waggish Welsh Judge, Jefferies Hardsman,
       In his grave office so completely skill'd,
     That when a culprit came far condemnation,
     He had his judge's joke for consolation.

     Good company 's a chess-board--there are kings,
       Queens, bishops, knights, rooks, pawns; the world 's a game;
     Save that the puppets pull at their own strings,
       Methinks gay Punch hath something of the same.
     My Muse, the butterfly hath but her wings,
       Not stings, and flits through ether without aim,
     Alighting rarely:--were she but a hornet,
     Perhaps there might be vices which would mourn it.

     I had forgotten--but must not forget--
       An orator, the latest of the session,
     Who had deliver'd well a very set
       Smooth speech, his first and maidenly transgression
     Upon debate: the papers echoed yet
       With his debut, which made a strong impression,
     And rank'd with what is every day display'd--
     'The best first speech that ever yet was made.'

     Proud of his 'Hear hims!' proud, too, of his vote
       And lost virginity of oratory,
     Proud of his learning (just enough to quote),
       He revell'd in his Ciceronian glory:
     With memory excellent to get by rote,
       With wit to hatch a pun or tell a story,
     Graced with some merit, and with more effrontery,
     'His country's pride,' he came down to the country.

     There also were two wits by acclamation,
       Longbow from Ireland, Strongbow from the Tweed,
     Both lawyers and both men of education;
       But Strongbow's wit was of more polish'd breed:
     Longbow was rich in an imagination
       As beautiful and bounding as a steed,
     But sometimes stumbling over a potato,--
     While Strongbow's best things might have come from Cato.

     Strongbow was like a new-tuned harpsichord;
       But Longbow wild as an AEolian harp,
     With which the winds of heaven can claim accord,
       And make a music, whether flat or sharp.
     Of Strongbow's talk you would not change a word:
       At Longbow's phrases you might sometimes carp:
     Both wits--one born so, and the other bred--
     This by his heart, his rival by his head.

     If all these seem a heterogeneous mas
       To be assembled at a country seat,
     Yet think, a specimen of every class
       Is better than a humdrum tete-a-tete.
     The days of Comedy are gone, alas!
       When Congreve's fool could vie with Moliere's bete:
     Society is smooth'd to that excess,
     That manners hardly differ more than dress.

     Our ridicules are kept in the back-ground--
       Ridiculous enough, but also dull;
     Professions, too, are no more to be found
       Professional; and there is nought to cull
     Of folly's fruit; for though your fools abound,
       They're barren, and not worth the pains to pull.
     Society is now one polish'd horde,
     Form'd of two mighty tribes, the Bores and Bored.

     But from being farmers, we turn gleaners, gleaning
       The scanty but right-well thresh'd ears of truth;
     And, gentle reader! when you gather meaning,
       You may be Boaz, and I--modest Ruth.
     Farther I 'd quote, but Scripture intervening
       Forbids. Its great impression in my youth
     Was made by Mrs. Adams, where she cries,
     'That Scriptures out of church are blasphemies.'

     But what we can we glean in this vile age
       Of chaff, although our gleanings be not grist.
     I must not quite omit the talking sage,
       Kit-Cat, the famous Conversationist,
     Who, in his common-place book, had a page
       Prepared each morn for evenings. 'List, oh, list!'-
     'Alas, poor ghost!'--What unexpected woes
     Await those who have studied their bon-mots!

     Firstly, they must allure the conversation
       By many windings to their clever clinch;
     And secondly, must let slip no occasion,
       Nor bate (abate) their hearers of an inch,
     But take an ell--and make a great sensation,
       If possible; and thirdly, never flinch
     When some smart talker puts them to the test,
     But seize the last word, which no doubt 's the best.

     Lord Henry and his lady were the hosts;
       The party we have touch'd on were the guests:
     Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts
       To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.
     I will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts,
       Albeit all human history attests
     That happiness for man--the hungry sinner!-
     Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.

     Witness the lands which 'flow'd with milk and honey,'
       Held out unto the hungry Israelites;
     To this we have added since, the love of money,
       The only sort of pleasure which requites.
     Youth fades, and leaves our days no longer sunny;
       We tire of mistresses and parasites;
     But oh, ambrosial cash! Ah! who would lose thee?
     When we no more can use, or even abuse thee!

     The gentlemen got up betimes to shoot,
       Or hunt: the young, because they liked the sport--
     The first thing boys like after play and fruit;
       The middle-aged to make the day more short;
     For ennui is a growth of English root,
       Though nameless in our language:--we retort
     The fact for words, and let the French translate
     That awful yawn which sleep can not abate.

     The elderly walk'd through the library,
       And tumbled books, or criticised the pictures,
     Or saunter'd through the gardens piteously,
       And made upon the hot-house several strictures,
     Or rode a nag which trotted not too high,
       Or on the morning papers read their lectures,
     Or on the watch their longing eyes would fix,
     Longing at sixty for the hour of six.

     But none were 'gene:' the great hour of union
       Was rung by dinner's knell; till then all were
     Masters of their own time--or in communion,
       Or solitary, as they chose to bear
     The hours, which how to pass is but to few known.
       Each rose up at his own, and had to spare
     What time he chose for dress, and broke his fast
     When, where, and how he chose for that repast.

     The ladies--some rouged, some a little pale--
       Met the morn as they might. If fine, they rode,
     Or walk'd; if foul, they read, or told a tale,
       Sung, or rehearsed the last dance from abroad;
     Discuss'd the fashion which might next prevail,
       And settled bonnets by the newest code,
     Or cramm'd twelve sheets into one little letter,
     To make each correspondent a new debtor.

     For some had absent lovers, all had friends.
       The earth has nothing like a she epistle,
     And hardly heaven--because it never ends.
       I love the mystery of a female missal,
     Which, like a creed, ne'er says all it intends,
       But full of cunning as Ulysses' whistle,
     When he allured poor Dolon:--you had better
     Take care what you reply to such a letter.

     Then there were billiards; cards, too, but no dice;--
       Save in the clubs no man of honour plays;--
     Boats when 't was water, skating when 't was ice,
       And the hard frost destroy'd the scenting days:
     And angling, too, that solitary vice,
       Whatever Izaak Walton sings or says;
     The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb, in his gullet
     Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.

     With evening came the banquet and the wine;
       The conversazione; the duet,
     Attuned by voices more or less divine
       (My heart or head aches with the memory yet).
     The four Miss Rawbolds in a glee would shine;
       But the two youngest loved more to be set
     Down to the harp--because to music's charms
     They added graceful necks, white hands and arms.

     Sometimes a dance (though rarely on field days,
       For then the gentlemen were rather tired)
     Display'd some sylph-like figures in its maze;
       Then there was small-talk ready when required;
     Flirtation--but decorous; the mere praise
       Of charms that should or should not be admired.
     The hunters fought their fox-hunt o'er again,
     And then retreated soberly--at ten.

     The politicians, in a nook apart,
       Discuss'd the world, and settled all the spheres;
     The wits watch'd every loophole for their art,
       To introduce a bon-mot head and ears;
     Small is the rest of those who would be smart,
       A moment's good thing may have cost them years
     Before they find an hour to introduce it;
     And then, even then, some bore may make them lose it.

     But all was gentle and aristocratic
       In this our party; polish'd, smooth, and cold,
     As Phidian forms cut out of marble Attic.
       There now are no Squire Westerns as of old;
     And our Sophias are not so emphatic,
       But fair as then, or fairer to behold.
     We have no accomplish'd blackguards, like Tom Jones,
     But gentlemen in stays, as stiff as stones.

     They separated at an early hour;
       That is, ere midnight--which is London's noon:
     But in the country ladies seek their bower
       A little earlier than the waning moon.
     Peace to the slumbers of each folded flower--
       May the rose call back its true colour soon!
     Good hours of fair cheeks are the fairest tinters,
     And lower the price of rouge--at least some winters.


[Illustration: Canto 14]




CANTO THE FOURTEENTH.

     If from great nature's or our own abyss
       Of thought we could but snatch a certainty,
     Perhaps mankind might find the path they miss--
       But then 't would spoil much good philosophy.
     One system eats another up, and this
       Much as old Saturn ate his progeny;
     For when his pious consort gave him stones
     In lieu of sons, of these he made no bones.

     But System doth reverse the Titan's breakfast,
       And eats her parents, albeit the digestion
     Is difficult. Pray tell me, can you make fast,
       After due search, your faith to any question?
     Look back o'er ages, ere unto the stake fast
       You bind yourself, and call some mode the best one.
     Nothing more true than not to trust your senses;
     And yet what are your other evidences?

     For me, I know nought; nothing I deny,
       Admit, reject, contemn; and what know you,
     Except perhaps that you were born to die?
       And both may after all turn out untrue.
     An age may come, Font of Eternity,
       When nothing shall be either old or new.
     Death, so call'd, is a thing which makes men weep,
     And yet a third of life is pass'd in sleep.

     A sleep without dreams, after a rough day
       Of toil, is what we covet most; and yet
     How clay shrinks back from more quiescent clay!
       The very Suicide that pays his debt
     At once without instalments (an old way
       Of paying debts, which creditors regret)
     Lets out impatiently his rushing breath,
     Less from disgust of life than dread of death.

     'T is round him, near him, here, there, every where;
       And there 's a courage which grows out of fear,
     Perhaps of all most desperate, which will dare
       The worst to know it:--when the mountains rear
     Their peaks beneath your human foot, and there
       You look down o'er the precipice, and drear
     The gulf of rock yawns,--you can't gaze a minute
     Without an awful wish to plunge within it.

     'T is true, you don't--but, pale and struck with terror,
       Retire: but look into your past impression!
     And you will find, though shuddering at the mirror
       Of your own thoughts, in all their self-confession,
     The lurking bias, be it truth or error,
       To the unknown; a secret prepossession,
     To plunge with all your fears--but where? You know not,
     And that's the reason why you do--or do not.

     But what 's this to the purpose? you will say.
       Gent. reader, nothing; a mere speculation,
     For which my sole excuse is--'t is my way;
       Sometimes with and sometimes without occasion
     I write what 's uppermost, without delay:
       This narrative is not meant for narration,
     But a mere airy and fantastic basis,
     To build up common things with common places.

     You know, or don't know, that great Bacon saith,
       'Fling up a straw, 't will show the way the wind blows;'
     And such a straw, borne on by human breath,
       Is poesy, according as the mind glows;
     A paper kite which flies 'twixt life and death,
       A shadow which the onward soul behind throws:
     And mine 's a bubble, not blown up for praise,
     But just to play with, as an infant plays.

     The world is all before me--or behind;
       For I have seen a portion of that same,
     And quite enough for me to keep in mind;--
       Of passions, too, I have proved enough to blame,
     To the great pleasure of our friends, mankind,
       Who like to mix some slight alloy with fame;
     For I was rather famous in my time,
     Until I fairly knock'd it up with rhyme.

     I have brought this world about my ears, and eke
       The other; that 's to say, the clergy, who
     Upon my head have bid their thunders break
       In pious libels by no means a few.
     And yet I can't help scribbling once a week,
       Tiring old readers, nor discovering new.
     In youth I wrote because my mind was full,
     And now because I feel it growing dull.

     But 'why then publish?'--There are no rewards
       Of fame or profit when the world grows weary.
     I ask in turn,--Why do you play at cards?
       Why drink? Why read?--To make some hour less dreary.
     It occupies me to turn back regards
       On what I 've seen or ponder'd, sad or cheery;
     And what I write I cast upon the stream,
     To swim or sink--I have had at least my dream.

     I think that were I certain of success,
       I hardly could compose another line:
     So long I 've battled either more or less,
       That no defeat can drive me from the Nine.
     This feeling 't is not easy to express,
       And yet 't is not affected, I opine.
     In play, there are two pleasures for your choosing--
     The one is winning, and the other losing.

     Besides, my Muse by no means deals in fiction:
       She gathers a repertory of facts,
     Of course with some reserve and slight restriction,
       But mostly sings of human things and acts--
     And that 's one cause she meets with contradiction;
       For too much truth, at first sight, ne'er attracts;
     And were her object only what 's call'd glory,
     With more ease too she 'd tell a different story.

     Love, war, a tempest--surely there 's variety;
       Also a seasoning slight of lucubration;
     A bird's-eye view, too, of that wild, Society;
       A slight glance thrown on men of every station.
     If you have nought else, here 's at least satiety
       Both in performance and in preparation;
     And though these lines should only line portmanteaus,
     Trade will be all the better for these Cantos.

     The portion of this world which I at present
       Have taken up to fill the following sermon,
     Is one of which there 's no description recent.
       The reason why is easy to determine:
     Although it seems both prominent and pleasant,
       There is a sameness in its gems and ermine,
     A dull and family likeness through all ages,
     Of no great promise for poetic pages.

     With much to excite, there 's little to exalt;
       Nothing that speaks to all men and all times;
     A sort of varnish over every fault;
       A kind of common-place, even in their crimes;
     Factitious passions, wit without much salt,
       A want of that true nature which sublimes
     Whate'er it shows with truth; a smooth monotony
     Of character, in those at least who have got any.

     Sometimes, indeed, like soldiers off parade,
       They break their ranks and gladly leave the drill;
     But then the roll-call draws them back afraid,
       And they must be or seem what they were: still
     Doubtless it is a brilliant masquerade;
       But when of the first sight you have had your fill,
     It palls--at least it did so upon me,
     This paradise of pleasure and ennui.

     When we have made our love, and gamed our gaming,
       Drest, voted, shone, and, may be, something more;
     With dandies dined; heard senators declaiming;
       Seen beauties brought to market by the score,
     Sad rakes to sadder husbands chastely taming;
       There 's little left but to be bored or bore.
     Witness those 'ci-devant jeunes hommes' who stem
     The stream, nor leave the world which leaveth them.

     'T is said--indeed a general complaint--
       That no one has succeeded in describing
     The monde, exactly as they ought to paint:
       Some say, that authors only snatch, by bribing
     The porter, some slight scandals strange and quaint,
       To furnish matter for their moral gibing;
     And that their books have but one style in common--
     My lady's prattle, filter'd through her woman.

     But this can't well be true, just now; for writers
       Are grown of the beau monde a part potential:
     I 've seen them balance even the scale with fighters,
       Especially when young, for that 's essential.
     Why do their sketches fail them as inditers
       Of what they deem themselves most consequential,
     The real portrait of the highest tribe?
     'T is that, in fact, there 's little to describe.

     'Haud ignara loquor;' these are Nugae, 'quarum
       Pars parva fui,' but still art and part.
     Now I could much more easily sketch a harem,
       A battle, wreck, or history of the heart,
     Than these things; and besides, I wish to spare 'em,
       For reasons which I choose to keep apart.
     'Vetabo Cereris sacrum qui vulgarit--'
     Which means that vulgar people must not share it.

     And therefore what I throw off is ideal--
       Lower'd, leaven'd, like a history of freemasons;
     Which bears the same relation to the real,
       As Captain Parry's voyage may do to Jason's.
     The grand arcanum 's not for men to see all;
       My music has some mystic diapasons;
     And there is much which could not be appreciated
     In any manner by the uninitiated.

     Alas! worlds fall--and woman, since she fell'd
       The world (as, since that history less polite
     Than true, hath been a creed so strictly held)
       Has not yet given up the practice quite.
     Poor thing of usages! coerced, compell'd,
       Victim when wrong, and martyr oft when right,
     Condemn'd to child-bed, as men for their sins
     Have shaving too entail'd upon their chins,--

     A daily plague, which in the aggregate
       May average on the whole with parturition.
     But as to women, who can penetrate
       The real sufferings of their she condition?
     Man's very sympathy with their estate
       Has much of selfishness, and more suspicion.
     Their love, their virtue, beauty, education,
     But form good housekeepers, to breed a nation.

     All this were very well, and can't be better;
       But even this is difficult, Heaven knows,
     So many troubles from her birth beset her,
       Such small distinction between friends and foes,
     The gilding wears so soon from off her fetter,
       That--but ask any woman if she'd choose
     (Take her at thirty, that is) to have been
     Female or male? a schoolboy or a queen?

     'Petticoat influence' is a great reproach,
       Which even those who obey would fain be thought
     To fly from, as from hungry pikes a roach;
       But since beneath it upon earth we are brought,
     By various joltings of life's hackney coach,
       I for one venerate a petticoat--
     A garment of a mystical sublimity,
     No matter whether russet, silk, or dimity.

     Much I respect, and much I have adored,
       In my young days, that chaste and goodly veil,
     Which holds a treasure, like a miser's hoard,
       And more attracts by all it doth conceal--
     A golden scabbard on a Damasque sword,
       A loving letter with a mystic seal,
     A cure for grief--for what can ever rankle
     Before a petticoat and peeping ankle?

     And when upon a silent, sullen day,
       With a sirocco, for example, blowing,
     When even the sea looks dim with all its spray,
       And sulkily the river's ripple 's flowing,
     And the sky shows that very ancient gray,
       The sober, sad antithesis to glowing,--
     'T is pleasant, if then any thing is pleasant,
     To catch a glimpse even of a pretty peasant.

     We left our heroes and our heroines
       In that fair clime which don't depend on climate,
     Quite independent of the Zodiac's signs,
       Though certainly more difficult to rhyme at,
     Because the sun, and stars, and aught that shines,
       Mountains, and all we can be most sublime at,
     Are there oft dull and dreary as a dun--
     Whether a sky's or tradesman's is all one.

     An in-door life is less poetical;
       And out of door hath showers, and mists, and sleet,
     With which I could not brew a pastoral.
       But be it as it may, a bard must meet
     All difficulties, whether great or small,
       To spoil his undertaking or complete,
     And work away like spirit upon matter,
     Embarrass'd somewhat both with fire and water.

     Juan--in this respect, at least, like saints--
       Was all things unto people of all sorts,
     And lived contentedly, without complaints,
       In camps, in ships, in cottages, or courts--
     Born with that happy soul which seldom faints,
       And mingling modestly in toils or sports.
     He likewise could be most things to all women,
     Without the coxcombry of certain she men.

     A fox-hunt to a foreigner is strange;
       'T is also subject to the double danger
     Of tumbling first, and having in exchange
       Some pleasant jesting at the awkward stranger:
     But Juan had been early taught to range
       The wilds, as doth an Arab turn'd avenger,
     So that his horse, or charger, hunter, hack,
     Knew that he had a rider on his back.

     And now in this new field, with some applause,
       He clear'd hedge, ditch, and double post, and rail,
     And never craned, and made but few 'faux pas,'
       And only fretted when the scent 'gan fail.
     He broke, 't is true, some statutes of the laws
       Of hunting--for the sagest youth is frail;
     Rode o'er the hounds, it may be, now and then,
     And once o'er several country gentlemen.

     But on the whole, to general admiration
       He acquitted both himself and horse: the squires
     Marvell'd at merit of another nation;
       The boors cried 'Dang it? who 'd have thought it?'--Sires,
     The Nestors of the sporting generation,
       Swore praises, and recall'd their former fires;
     The huntsman's self relented to a grin,
     And rated him almost a whipper-in.

     Such were his trophies--not of spear and shield,
       But leaps, and bursts, and sometimes foxes' brushes;
     Yet I must own,--although in this I yield
       To patriot sympathy a Briton's blushes,--
     He thought at heart like courtly Chesterfield,
       Who, after a long chase o'er hills, dales, bushes,
     And what not, though he rode beyond all price,
     Ask'd next day, 'If men ever hunted twice?'

     He also had a quality uncommon
       To early risers after a long chase,
     Who wake in winter ere the cock can summon
       December's drowsy day to his dull race,--
     A quality agreeable to woman,
       When her soft, liquid words run on apace,
     Who likes a listener, whether saint or sinner,--
     He did not fall asleep just after dinner;

     But, light and airy, stood on the alert,
       And shone in the best part of dialogue,
     By humouring always what they might assert,
       And listening to the topics most in vogue;
     Now grave, now gay, but never dull or pert;
       And smiling but in secret--cunning rogue!
     He ne'er presumed to make an error clearer;--
     In short, there never was a better hearer.

     And then he danced;--all foreigners excel
       The serious Angles in the eloquence
     Of pantomime;--he danced, I say, right well,
       With emphasis, and also with good sense--
     A thing in footing indispensable;
       He danced without theatrical pretence,
     Not like a ballet-master in the van
     Of his drill'd nymphs, but like a gentleman.

     Chaste were his steps, each kept within due bound,
       And elegance was sprinkled o'er his figure;
     Like swift Camilla, he scarce skimm'd the ground,
       And rather held in than put forth his vigour;
     And then he had an ear for music's sound,
       Which might defy a crotchet critic's rigour.
     Such classic pas--sans flaws--set off our hero,
     He glanced like a personified Bolero;

     Or, like a flying Hour before Aurora,
       In Guido's famous fresco which alone
     Is worth a tour to Rome, although no more a
       Remnant were there of the old world's sole throne.
     The 'tout ensemble' of his movements wore a
       Grace of the soft ideal, seldom shown,
     And ne'er to be described; for to the dolour
     Of bards and prosers, words are void of colour.

     No marvel then he was a favourite;
       A full-grown Cupid, very much admired;
     A little spoilt, but by no means so quite;
       At least he kept his vanity retired.
     Such was his tact, he could alike delight
       The chaste, and those who are not so much inspired.
     The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke, who loved 'tracasserie,'
     Began to treat him with some small 'agacerie.'

     She was a fine and somewhat full-blown blonde,
       Desirable, distinguish'd, celebrated
     For several winters in the grand, grand monde.
       I 'd rather not say what might be related
     Of her exploits, for this were ticklish ground;
       Besides there might be falsehood in what 's stated:
     Her late performance had been a dead set
     At Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.

     This noble personage began to look
       A little black upon this new flirtation;
     But such small licences must lovers brook,
       Mere freedoms of the female corporation.
     Woe to the man who ventures a rebuke!
       'T will but precipitate a situation
     Extremely disagreeable, but common
     To calculators when they count on woman.

     The circle smiled, then whisper'd, and then sneer'd;
       The Misses bridled, and the matrons frown'd;
     Some hoped things might not turn out as they fear'd;
       Some would not deem such women could be found;
     Some ne'er believed one half of what they heard;
       Some look'd perplex'd, and others look'd profound;
     And several pitied with sincere regret
     Poor Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.

     But what is odd, none ever named the duke,
       Who, one might think, was something in the affair;
     True, he was absent, and, 't was rumour'd, took
       But small concern about the when, or where,
     Or what his consort did: if he could brook
       Her gaieties, none had a right to stare:
     Theirs was that best of unions, past all doubt,
     Which never meets, and therefore can't fall out.

     But, oh! that I should ever pen so sad a line!
       Fired with an abstract love of virtue, she,
     My Dian of the Ephesians, Lady Adeline,
       Began to think the duchess' conduct free;
     Regretting much that she had chosen so bad a line,
       And waxing chiller in her courtesy,
     Look'd grave and pale to see her friend's fragility,
     For which most friends reserve their sensibility.

     There 's nought in this bad world like sympathy:
       'T is so becoming to the soul and face,
     Sets to soft music the harmonious sigh,
       And robes sweet friendship in a Brussels lace.
     Without a friend, what were humanity,
       To hunt our errors up with a good grace?
     Consoling us with--'Would you had thought twice!
     Ah, if you had but follow'd my advice!'

     O job! you had two friends: one 's quite enough,
       Especially when we are ill at ease;
     They are but bad pilots when the weather 's rough,
       Doctors less famous for their cures than fees.
     Let no man grumble when his friends fall off,
       As they will do like leaves at the first breeze:
     When your affairs come round, one way or t' other,
     Go to the coffee-house, and take another.

     But this is not my maxim: had it been,
       Some heart-aches had been spared me: yet I care not--
     I would not be a tortoise in his screen
       Of stubborn shell, which waves and weather wear not.
     'T is better on the whole to have felt and seen
       That which humanity may bear, or bear not:
     'T will teach discernment to the sensitive,
     And not to pour their ocean in a sieve.

     Of all the horrid, hideous notes of woe,
       Sadder than owl-songs or the midnight blast,
     Is that portentous phrase, 'I told you so,'
       Utter'd by friends, those prophets of the past,
     Who, 'stead of saying what you now should do,
       Own they foresaw that you would fall at last,
     And solace your slight lapse 'gainst 'bonos mores,'
     With a long memorandum of old stories.

     The Lady Adeline's serene severity
       Was not confined to feeling for her friend,
     Whose fame she rather doubted with posterity,
       Unless her habits should begin to mend:
     But Juan also shared in her austerity,
       But mix'd with pity, pure as e'er was penn'd:
     His inexperience moved her gentle ruth,
     And (as her junior by six weeks) his youth.

     These forty days' advantage of her years--
       And hers were those which can face calculation,
     Boldly referring to the list of peers
       And noble births, nor dread the enumeration--
     Gave her a right to have maternal fears
       For a young gentleman's fit education,
     Though she was far from that leap year, whose leap,
     In female dates, strikes Time all of a heap.

     This may be fix'd at somewhere before thirty--
       Say seven-and-twenty; for I never knew
     The strictest in chronology and virtue
       Advance beyond, while they could pass for new.
     O Time! why dost not pause? Thy scythe, so dirty
       With rust, should surely cease to hack and hew.
     Reset it; shave more smoothly, also slower,
     If but to keep thy credit as a mower.

     But Adeline was far from that ripe age,
       Whose ripeness is but bitter at the best:
     'T was rather her experience made her sage,
       For she had seen the world and stood its test,
     As I have said in--I forget what page;
       My Muse despises reference, as you have guess'd
     By this time;--but strike six from seven-and-twenty,
     And you will find her sum of years in plenty.

     At sixteen she came out; presented, vaunted,
       She put all coronets into commotion:
     At seventeen, too, the world was still enchanted
       With the new Venus of their brilliant ocean:
     At eighteen, though below her feet still panted
       A hecatomb of suitors with devotion,
     She had consented to create again
     That Adam, call'd 'The happiest of men.'

     Since then she had sparkled through three glowing winters,
       Admired, adored; but also so correct,
     That she had puzzled all the acutest hinters,
       Without the apparel of being circumspect:
     They could not even glean the slightest splinters
       From off the marble, which had no defect.
     She had also snatch'd a moment since her marriage
     To bear a son and heir--and one miscarriage.

     Fondly the wheeling fire-flies flew around her,
       Those little glitterers of the London night;
     But none of these possess'd a sting to wound her--
       She was a pitch beyond a coxcomb's flight.
     Perhaps she wish'd an aspirant profounder;
       But whatsoe'er she wish'd, she acted right;
     And whether coldness, pride, or virtue dignify
     A woman, so she 's good, what does it signify?

     I hate a motive, like a lingering bottle
       Which with the landlord makes too long a stand,
     Leaving all-claretless the unmoisten'd throttle,
       Especially with politics on hand;
     I hate it, as I hate a drove of cattle,
       Who whirl the dust as simooms whirl the sand;
     I hate it, as I hate an argument,
     A laureate's ode, or servile peer's 'content.'

     'T is sad to hack into the roots of things,
       They are so much intertwisted with the earth;
     So that the branch a goodly verdure flings,
       I reck not if an acorn gave it birth.
     To trace all actions to their secret springs
       Would make indeed some melancholy mirth;
     But this is not at present my concern,
     And I refer you to wise Oxenstiern.

     With the kind view of saving an eclat,
       Both to the duchess and diplomatist,
     The Lady Adeline, as soon 's she saw
       That Juan was unlikely to resist
     (For foreigners don't know that a faux pas
       In England ranks quite on a different list
     From those of other lands unblest with juries,
     Whose verdict for such sin a certain cure is);--

     The Lady Adeline resolved to take
       Such measures as she thought might best impede
     The farther progress of this sad mistake.
       She thought with some simplicity indeed;
     But innocence is bold even at the stake,
       And simple in the world, and doth not need
     Nor use those palisades by dames erected,
     Whose virtue lies in never being detected.

     It was not that she fear'd the very worst:
       His Grace was an enduring, married man,
     And was not likely all at once to burst
       Into a scene, and swell the clients' clan
     Of Doctors' Commons: but she dreaded first
       The magic of her Grace's talisman,
     And next a quarrel (as he seem'd to fret)
     With Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.

     Her Grace, too, pass'd for being an intrigante,
       And somewhat mechante in her amorous sphere;
     One of those pretty, precious plagues, which haunt
       A lover with caprices soft and dear,
     That like to make a quarrel, when they can't
       Find one, each day of the delightful year;
     Bewitching, torturing, as they freeze or glow,
     And--what is worst of all--won't let you go:

     The sort of thing to turn a young man's head,
       Or make a Werter of him in the end.
     No wonder then a purer soul should dread
       This sort of chaste liaison for a friend;
     It were much better to be wed or dead,
       Than wear a heart a woman loves to rend.
     'T is best to pause, and think, ere you rush on,
     If that a 'bonne fortune' be really 'bonne.'

     And first, in the o'erflowing of her heart,
       Which really knew or thought it knew no guile,
     She call'd her husband now and then apart,
       And bade him counsel Juan. With a smile
     Lord Henry heard her plans of artless art
       To wean Don Juan from the siren's wile;
     And answer'd, like a statesman or a prophet,
     In such guise that she could make nothing of it.

     Firstly, he said, 'he never interfered
       In any body's business but the king's:'
     Next, that 'he never judged from what appear'd,
       Without strong reason, of those sort of things:'
     Thirdly, that 'Juan had more brain than beard,
       And was not to be held in leading strings;'
     And fourthly, what need hardly be said twice,
     'That good but rarely came from good advice.'

     And, therefore, doubtless to approve the truth
       Of the last axiom, he advised his spouse
     To leave the parties to themselves, forsooth--
       At least as far as bienseance allows:
     That time would temper Juan's faults of youth;
       That young men rarely made monastic vows;
     That opposition only more attaches--
     But here a messenger brought in despatches:

     And being of the council call'd 'the Privy,'
       Lord Henry walk'd into his cabinet,
     To furnish matter for some future Livy
       To tell how he reduced the nation's debt;
     And if their full contents I do not give ye,
       It is because I do not know them yet;
     But I shall add them in a brief appendix,
     To come between mine epic and its index.

     But ere he went, he added a slight hint,
       Another gentle common-place or two,
     Such as are coin'd in conversation's mint,
       And pass, for want of better, though not new:
     Then broke his packet, to see what was in 't,
       And having casually glanced it through,
     Retired; and, as went out, calmly kiss'd her,
     Less like a young wife than an aged sister.

     He was a cold, good, honourable man,
       Proud of his birth, and proud of every thing;
     A goodly spirit for a state divan,
       A figure fit to walk before a king;
     Tall, stately, form'd to lead the courtly van
       On birthdays, glorious with a star and string;
     The very model of a chamberlain--
     And such I mean to make him when I reign.

     But there was something wanting on the whole--
       I don't know what, and therefore cannot tell--
     Which pretty women--the sweet souls!--call soul.
       Certes it was not body; he was well
     Proportion'd, as a poplar or a pole,
       A handsome man, that human miracle;
     And in each circumstance of love or war
     Had still preserved his perpendicular.

     Still there was something wanting, as I 've said--
       That undefinable 'Je ne scais quoi,'
     Which, for what I know, may of yore have led
       To Homer's Iliad, since it drew to Troy
     The Greek Eve, Helen, from the Spartan's bed;
       Though on the whole, no doubt, the Dardan boy
     Was much inferior to King Menelaus:--
     But thus it is some women will betray us.

     There is an awkward thing which much perplexes,
       Unless like wise Tiresias we had proved
     By turns the difference of the several sexes;
       Neither can show quite how they would be loved.
     The sensual for a short time but connects us,
       The sentimental boasts to be unmoved;
     But both together form a kind of centaur,
     Upon whose back 't is better not to venture.

     A something all-sufficient for the heart
       Is that for which the sex are always seeking:
     But how to fill up that same vacant part?
       There lies the rub--and this they are but weak in.
     Frail mariners afloat without a chart,
       They run before the wind through high seas breaking;
     And when they have made the shore through every shock,
     'T is odd, or odds, it may turn out a rock.

     There is a flower call'd 'Love in Idleness,'
       For which see Shakspeare's everblooming garden;--
     I will not make his great description less,
       And beg his British godship's humble pardon,
     If in my extremity of rhyme's distress,
       I touch a single leaf where he is warden;--
     But though the flower is different, with the French
     Or Swiss Rousseau, cry 'Voila la Pervenche!'

     Eureka! I have found it! What I mean
       To say is, not that love is idleness,
     But that in love such idleness has been
       An accessory, as I have cause to guess.
     Hard labour's an indifferent go-between;
       Your men of business are not apt to express
     Much passion, since the merchant-ship, the Argo,
     Convey'd Medea as her supercargo.

     'Beatus ille procul!' from 'negotiis,'
       Saith Horace; the great little poet 's wrong;
     His other maxim, 'Noscitur a sociis,'
       Is much more to the purpose of his song;
     Though even that were sometimes too ferocious,
       Unless good company be kept too long;
     But, in his teeth, whate'er their state or station,
     Thrice happy they who have an occupation!

     Adam exchanged his Paradise for ploughing,
       Eve made up millinery with fig leaves--
     The earliest knowledge from the tree so knowing,
       As far as I know, that the church receives:
     And since that time it need not cost much showing,
       That many of the ills o'er which man grieves,
     And still more women, spring from not employing
     Some hours to make the remnant worth enjoying.

     And hence high life is oft a dreary void,
       A rack of pleasures, where we must invent
     A something wherewithal to be annoy'd.
       Bards may sing what they please about Content;
     Contented, when translated, means but cloy'd;
       And hence arise the woes of sentiment,
     Blue devils, and blue-stockings, and romances
     Reduced to practice, and perform'd like dances.

     I do declare, upon an affidavit,
       Romances I ne'er read like those I have seen;
     Nor, if unto the world I ever gave it,
       Would some believe that such a tale had been:
     But such intent I never had, nor have it;
       Some truths are better kept behind a screen,
     Especially when they would look like lies;
     I therefore deal in generalities.

     'An oyster may be cross'd in love,'--and why?
       Because he mopeth idly in his shell,
     And heaves a lonely subterraqueous sigh,
       Much as a monk may do within his cell:
     And a-propos of monks, their piety
       With sloth hath found it difficult to dwell;
     Those vegetables of the Catholic creed
     Are apt exceedingly to run to seed.

     O Wilberforce! thou man of black renown,
       Whose merit none enough can sing or say,
     Thou hast struck one immense Colossus down,
       Thou moral Washington of Africa!
     But there 's another little thing, I own,
       Which you should perpetrate some summer's day,
     And set the other halt of earth to rights;
     You have freed the blacks--now pray shut up the whites.

     Shut up the bald-coot bully Alexander!
       Ship off the Holy Three to Senegal;
     Teach them that 'sauce for goose is sauce for gander,'
       And ask them how they like to be in thrall?
     Shut up each high heroic salamander,
       Who eats fire gratis (since the pay 's but small);
     Shut up--no, not the King, but the Pavilion,
     Or else 't will cost us all another million.

     Shut up the world at large, let Bedlam out;
       And you will be perhaps surprised to find
     All things pursue exactly the same route,
       As now with those of soi-disant sound mind.
     This I could prove beyond a single doubt,
       Were there a jot of sense among mankind;
     But till that point d'appui is found, alas!
     Like Archimedes, I leave earth as 't was.

     Our gentle Adeline had one defect--
       Her heart was vacant, though a splendid mansion;
     Her conduct had been perfectly correct,
       As she had seen nought claiming its expansion.
     A wavering spirit may be easier wreck'd,
       Because 't is frailer, doubtless, than a stanch one;
     But when the latter works its own undoing,
     Its inner crash is like an earthquake's ruin.

     She loved her lord, or thought so; but that love
       Cost her an effort, which is a sad toil,
     The stone of Sisyphus, if once we move
       Our feelings 'gainst the nature of the soil.
     She had nothing to complain of, or reprove,
       No bickerings, no connubial turmoil:
     Their union was a model to behold,
     Serene and noble,--conjugal, but cold.

     There was no great disparity of years,
       Though much in temper; but they never clash'd:
     They moved like stars united in their spheres,
       Or like the Rhone by Leman's waters wash'd,
     Where mingled and yet separate appears
       The river from the lake, all bluely dash'd
     Through the serene and placid glassy deep,
     Which fain would lull its river-child to sleep.

     Now when she once had ta'en an interest
       In any thing, however she might flatter
     Herself that her intentions were the best,
       Intense intentions are a dangerous matter:
     Impressions were much stronger than she guess'd,
       And gather'd as they run like growing water
     Upon her mind; the more so, as her breast
     Was not at first too readily impress'd.

     But when it was, she had that lurking demon
       Of double nature, and thus doubly named--
     Firmness yclept in heroes, kings, and seamen,
       That is, when they succeed; but greatly blamed
     As obstinacy, both in men and women,
       Whene'er their triumph pales, or star is tamed:--
     And 't will perplex the casuist in morality
     To fix the due bounds of this dangerous quality.

     Had Buonaparte won at Waterloo,
       It had been firmness; now 't is pertinacity:
     Must the event decide between the two?
       I leave it to your people of sagacity
     To draw the line between the false and true,
       If such can e'er be drawn by man's capacity:
     My business is with Lady Adeline,
     Who in her way too was a heroine.

     She knew not her own heart; then how should I?
       I think not she was then in love with Juan:
     If so, she would have had the strength to fly
       The wild sensation, unto her a new one:
     She merely felt a common sympathy
       (I will not say it was a false or true one)
     In him, because she thought he was in danger,--
     Her husband's friend, her own, young, and a stranger,

     She was, or thought she was, his friend--and this
       Without the farce of friendship, or romance
     Of Platonism, which leads so oft amiss
       Ladies who have studied friendship but in France,
     Or Germany, where people purely kiss.
       To thus much Adeline would not advance;
     But of such friendship as man's may to man be
     She was as capable as woman can be.

     No doubt the secret influence of the sex
       Will there, as also in the ties of blood,
     An innocent predominance annex,
       And tune the concord to a finer mood.
     If free from passion, which all friendship checks,
       And your true feelings fully understood,
     No friend like to a woman earth discovers,
     So that you have not been nor will be lovers.

     Love bears within its breast the very germ
       Of change; and how should this be otherwise?
     That violent things more quickly find a term
       Is shown through nature's whole analogies;
     And how should the most fierce of all be firm?
       Would you have endless lightning in the skies?
     Methinks Love's very title says enough:
     How should 'the tender passion' e'er be tough?

     Alas! by all experience, seldom yet
       (I merely quote what I have heard from many)
     Had lovers not some reason to regret
       The passion which made Solomon a zany.
     I 've also seen some wives (not to forget
       The marriage state, the best or worst of any)
     Who were the very paragons of wives,
     Yet made the misery of at least two lives.

     I 've also seen some female friends ( 't is odd,
       But true--as, if expedient, I could prove)
     That faithful were through thick and thin, abroad,
       At home, far more than ever yet was Love--
     Who did not quit me when Oppression trod
       Upon me; whom no scandal could remove;
     Who fought, and fight, in absence, too, my battles,
     Despite the snake Society's loud rattles.

     Whether Don Juan and chaste Adeline
       Grew friends in this or any other sense,
     Will be discuss'd hereafter, I opine:
       At present I am glad of a pretence
     To leave them hovering, as the effect is fine,
       And keeps the atrocious reader in suspense;
     The surest way for ladies and for books
     To bait their tender, or their tenter, hooks.

     Whether they rode, or walk'd, or studied Spanish
       To read Don Quixote in the original,
     A pleasure before which all others vanish;
       Whether their talk was of the kind call'd 'small,'
     Or serious, are the topics I must banish
       To the next Canto; where perhaps I shall
     Say something to the purpose, and display
     Considerable talent in my way.

     Above all, I beg all men to forbear
       Anticipating aught about the matter:
     They 'll only make mistakes about the fair,
       And Juan too, especially the latter.
     And I shall take a much more serious air
       Than I have yet done, in this epic satire.
     It is not clear that Adeline and Juan
     Will fall; but if they do, 't will be their ruin.

     But great things spring from little:--Would you think,
       That in our youth, as dangerous a passion
     As e'er brought man and woman to the brink
       Of ruin, rose from such a slight occasion,
     As few would ever dream could form the link
       Of such a sentimental situation?
     You 'll never guess, I 'll bet you millions, milliards--
     It all sprung from a harmless game at billiards.

     'T is strange,--but true; for truth is always strange;
       Stranger than fiction; if it could be told,
     How much would novels gain by the exchange!
       How differently the world would men behold!
     How oft would vice and virtue places change!
       The new world would be nothing to the old,
     If some Columbus of the moral seas
     Would show mankind their souls' antipodes.

     What 'antres vast and deserts idle' then
       Would be discover'd in the human soul!
     What icebergs in the hearts of mighty men,
       With self-love in the centre as their pole!
     What Anthropophagi are nine of ten
       Of those who hold the kingdoms in control
     Were things but only call'd by their right name,
     Caesar himself would be ashamed of fame.




CANTO THE FIFTEENTH.

     Ah!--What should follow slips from my reflection;
       Whatever follows ne'ertheless may be
     As _à propos_ of hope or retrospection,
       As though the lurking thought had follow'd free.
     All present life is but an interjection,
       An 'Oh!' or 'Ah!' of joy or misery,
     Or a 'Ha! ha!' or 'Bah!'--a yawn, or 'Pooh!'
     Of which perhaps the latter is most true.

     But, more or less, the whole 's a syncope
       Or a singultus--emblems of emotion,
     The grand antithesis to great ennui,
       Wherewith we break our bubbles on the ocean,--
     That watery outline of eternity,
       Or miniature at least, as is my notion,
     Which ministers unto the soul's delight,
     In seeing matters which are out of sight.

     But all are better than the sigh supprest,
       Corroding in the cavern of the heart,
     Making the countenance a masque of rest,
       And turning human nature to an art.
     Few men dare show their thoughts of worst or best;
       Dissimulation always sets apart
     A corner for herself; and therefore fiction
     Is that which passes with least contradiction.

     Ah! who can tell? Or rather, who can not
       Remember, without telling, passion's errors?
     The drainer of oblivion, even the sot,
       Hath got blue devils for his morning mirrors:
     What though on Lethe's stream he seem to float,
       He cannot sink his tremors or his terrors;
     The ruby glass that shakes within his hand
     Leaves a sad sediment of Time's worst sand.

     And as for love--O love!--We will proceed.
       The Lady Adeline Amundeville,
     A pretty name as one would wish to read,
       Must perch harmonious on my tuneful quill.
     There 's music in the sighing of a reed;
       There 's music in the gushing of a rill;
     There 's music in all things, if men had ears:
     Their earth is but an echo of the spheres.

     The Lady Adeline, right honourable;
       And honour'd, ran a risk of growing less so;
     For few of the soft sex are very stable
       In their resolves--alas! that I should say so!
     They differ as wine differs from its label,
       When once decanted;--I presume to guess so,
     But will not swear: yet both upon occasion,
     Till old, may undergo adulteration.

     But Adeline was of the purest vintage,
       The unmingled essence of the grape; and yet
     Bright as a new Napoleon from its mintage,
       Or glorious as a diamond richly set;
     A page where Time should hesitate to print age,
       And for which Nature might forego her debt--
     Sole creditor whose process doth involve in 't
     The luck of finding every body solvent.

     O Death! thou dunnest of all duns! thou daily
       Knockest at doors, at first with modest tap,
     Like a meek tradesman when, approaching palely,
       Some splendid debtor he would take by sap:
     But oft denied, as patience 'gins to fail, he
       Advances with exasperated rap,
     And (if let in) insists, in terms unhandsome,
     On ready money, or 'a draft on Ransom.'

     Whate'er thou takest, spare a while poor Beauty!
       She is so rare, and thou hast so much prey.
     What though she now and then may slip from duty,
       The more 's the reason why you ought to stay.
     Gaunt Gourmand! with whole nations for your booty,
       You should be civil in a modest way:
     Suppress, then, some slight feminine diseases,
     And take as many heroes as Heaven pleases.

     Fair Adeline, the more ingenuous
       Where she was interested (as was said),
     Because she was not apt, like some of us,
       To like too readily, or too high bred
     To show it (points we need not now discuss)--
       Would give up artlessly both heart and head
     Unto such feelings as seem'd innocent,
     For objects worthy of the sentiment.

     Some parts of Juan's history, which Rumour,
       That live gazette, had scatter'd to disfigure,
     She had heard; but women hear with more good humour
       Such aberrations than we men of rigour:
     Besides, his conduct, since in England, grew more
       Strict, and his mind assumed a manlier vigour;
     Because he had, like Alcibiades,
     The art of living in all climes with ease.

     His manner was perhaps the more seductive,
       Because he ne'er seem'd anxious to seduce;
     Nothing affected, studied, or constructive
       Of coxcombry or conquest: no abuse
     Of his attractions marr'd the fair perspective,
       To indicate a Cupidon broke loose,
     And seem to say, 'Resist us if you can'-
     Which makes a dandy while it spoils a man.

     They are wrong--that 's not the way to set about it;
       As, if they told the truth, could well be shown.
     But, right or wrong, Don Juan was without it;
       In fact, his manner was his own alone;
     Sincere he was--at least you could not doubt it,
       In listening merely to his voice's tone.
     The devil hath not in all his quiver's choice
     An arrow for the heart like a sweet voice.

     By nature soft, his whole address held off
       Suspicion: though not timid, his regard
     Was such as rather seem'd to keep aloof,
       To shield himself than put you on your guard:
     Perhaps 't was hardly quite assured enough,
       But modesty 's at times its own reward,
     Like virtue; and the absence of pretension
     Will go much farther than there 's need to mention.

     Serene, accomplish'd, cheerful but not loud;
       Insinuating without insinuation;
     Observant of the foibles of the crowd,
       Yet ne'er betraying this in conversation;
     Proud with the proud, yet courteously proud,
       So as to make them feel he knew his station
     And theirs:--without a struggle for priority,
     He neither brook'd nor claim'd superiority.

     That is, with men: with women he was what
       They pleased to make or take him for; and their
     Imagination 's quite enough for that:
       So that the outline 's tolerably fair,
     They fill the canvas up--and 'verbum sat.'
       If once their phantasies be brought to bear
     Upon an object, whether sad or playful,
     They can transfigure brighter than a Raphael.

     Adeline, no deep judge of character,
       Was apt to add a colouring from her own:
     'T is thus the good will amiably err,
       And eke the wise, as has been often shown.
     Experience is the chief philosopher,
       But saddest when his science is well known:
     And persecuted sages teach the schools
     Their folly in forgetting there are fools.

     Was it not so, great Locke? and greater Bacon?
       Great Socrates? And thou, Diviner still,
     Whose lot it is by man to be mistaken,
       And thy pure creed made sanction of all ill?
     Redeeming worlds to be by bigots shaken,
       How was thy toil rewarded? We might fill
     Volumes with similar sad illustrations,
     But leave them to the conscience of the nations.

     I perch upon an humbler promontory,
       Amidst life's infinite variety:
     With no great care for what is nicknamed glory,
       But speculating as I cast mine eye
     On what may suit or may not suit my story,
       And never straining hard to versify,
     I rattle on exactly as I 'd talk
     With any body in a ride or walk.

     I don't know that there may be much ability
       Shown in this sort of desultory rhyme;
     But there 's a conversational facility,
       Which may round off an hour upon a time.
     Of this I 'm sure at least, there 's no servility
       In mine irregularity of chime,
     Which rings what 's uppermost of new or hoary,
     Just as I feel the 'Improvvisatore.'

     'Omnia vult belle Matho dicere--dic aliquando
       Et bene, dic neutrum, dic aliquando male.'
     The first is rather more than mortal can do;
       The second may be sadly done or gaily;
     The third is still more difficult to stand to;
       The fourth we hear, and see, and say too, daily.
     The whole together is what I could wish
     To serve in this conundrum of a dish.

     A modest hope--but modesty 's my forte,
       And pride my feeble:--let us ramble on.
     I meant to make this poem very short,
       But now I can't tell where it may not run.
     No doubt, if I had wish' to pay my court
       To critics, or to hail the setting sun
     Of tyranny of all kinds, my concision
     Were more;--but I was born for opposition.

     But then 't is mostly on the weaker side;
       So that I verily believe if they
     Who now are basking in their full-blown pride
       Were shaken down, and 'dogs had had their day,'
     Though at the first I might perchance deride
       Their tumble, I should turn the other way,
     And wax an ultra-royalist in loyalty,
     Because I hate even democratic royalty.

     I think I should have made a decent spouse,
       If I had never proved the soft condition;
     I think I should have made monastic vows,
       But for my own peculiar superstition:
     'Gainst rhyme I never should have knock'd my brows,
       Nor broken my own head, nor that of Priscian,
     Nor worn the motley mantle of a poet,
     If some one had not told me to forego it.

     But 'laissez aller'--knights and dames I sing,
       Such as the times may furnish. 'T is a flight
     Which seems at first to need no lofty wing,
       Plumed by Longinus or the Stagyrite:
     The difficultly lies in colouring
       (Keeping the due proportions still in sight)
     With nature manners which are artificial,
     And rend'ring general that which is especial.

     The difference is, that in the days of old
       Men made the manners; manners now make men--
     Pinn'd like a flock, and fleeced too in their fold,
       At least nine, and a ninth beside of ten.
     Now this at all events must render cold
       Your writers, who must either draw again
     Days better drawn before, or else assume
     The present, with their common-place costume.

     We 'll do our best to make the best on 't:--March!
       March, my Muse! If you cannot fly, yet flutter;
     And when you may not be sublime, be arch,
       Or starch, as are the edicts statesmen utter.
     We surely may find something worth research:
       Columbus found a new world in a cutter,
     Or brigantine, or pink, of no great tonnage,
     While yet America was in her non-age.

     When Adeline, in all her growing sense
       Of Juan's merits and his situation,
     Felt on the whole an interest intense,--
       Partly perhaps because a fresh sensation,
     Or that he had an air of innocence,
       Which is for innocence a sad temptation,--
     As women hate half measures, on the whole,
     She 'gan to ponder how to save his soul.

     She had a good opinion of advice,
       Like all who give and eke receive it gratis,
     For which small thanks are still the market price,
       Even where the article at highest rate is:
     She thought upon the subject twice or thrice,
       And morally decided, the best state is
     For morals, marriage; and this question carried,
     She seriously advised him to get married.

     Juan replied, with all becoming deference,
       He had a predilection for that tie;
     But that, at present, with immediate reference
       To his own circumstances, there might lie
     Some difficulties, as in his own preference,
       Or that of her to whom he might apply:
     That still he 'd wed with such or such a lady,
     If that they were not married all already.

     Next to the making matches for herself,
       And daughters, brothers, sisters, kith or kin,
     Arranging them like books on the same shelf,
       There 's nothing women love to dabble in
     More (like a stock-holder in growing pelf)
       Than match-making in general: 't is no sin
     Certes, but a preventative, and therefore
     That is, no doubt, the only reason wherefore.

     But never yet (except of course a miss
       Unwed, or mistress never to be wed,
     Or wed already, who object to this)
       Was there chaste dame who had not in her head
     Some drama of the marriage unities,
       Observed as strictly both at board and bed
     As those of Aristotle, though sometimes
     They turn out melodrames or pantomimes.

     They generally have some only son,
       Some heir to a large property, some friend
     Of an old family, some gay Sir john,
       Or grave Lord George, with whom perhaps might end
     A line, and leave posterity undone,
       Unless a marriage was applied to mend
     The prospect and their morals: and besides,
     They have at hand a blooming glut of brides.

     From these they will be careful to select,
       For this an heiress, and for that a beauty;
     For one a songstress who hath no defect,
       For t' other one who promises much duty;
     For this a lady no one can reject,
       Whose sole accomplishments were quite a booty;
     A second for her excellent connections;
     A third, because there can be no objections.

     When Rapp the Harmonist embargo'd marriage
       In his harmonious settlement (which flourishes
     Strangely enough as yet without miscarriage,
       Because it breeds no more mouths than it nourishes,
     Without those sad expenses which disparage
       What Nature naturally most encourages)--
     Why call'd he 'Harmony' a state sans wedlock?
     Now here I 've got the preacher at a dead lock.

     Because he either meant to sneer at harmony
       Or marriage, by divorcing them thus oddly.
     But whether reverend Rapp learn'd this in Germany
       Or no, 't is said his sect is rich and godly,
     Pious and pure, beyond what I can term any
       Of ours, although they propagate more broadly.
     My objection 's to his title, not his ritual,
     Although I wonder how it grew habitual.

     But Rapp is the reverse of zealous matrons,
       Who favour, malgre Malthus, generation--
     Professors of that genial art, and patrons
       Of all the modest part of propagation;
     Which after all at such a desperate rate runs,
       That half its produce tends to emigration,
     That sad result of passions and potatoes--
     Two weeds which pose our economic Catos.

     Had Adeline read Malthus? I can't tell;
       I wish she had: his book 's the eleventh commandment,
     Which says, 'Thou shalt not marry,' unless well:
       This he (as far as I can understand) meant.
     'T is not my purpose on his views to dwell
       Nor canvass what so 'eminent a hand' meant;
     But certes it conducts to lives ascetic,
     Or turning marriage into arithmetic.

     But Adeline, who probably presumed
       That Juan had enough of maintenance,
     Or separate maintenance, in case 't was doom'd--
       As on the whole it is an even chance
     That bridegrooms, after they are fairly groom'd,
       May retrograde a little in the dance
     Of marriage (which might form a painter's fame,
     Like Holbein's 'Dance of Death'--but 't is the same);--

     But Adeline determined Juan's wedding
       In her own mind, and that 's enough for woman:
     But then, with whom? There was the sage Miss Reading,
       Miss Raw, Miss Flaw, Miss Showman, and Miss Knowman.
     And the two fair co-heiresses Giltbedding.
       She deem'd his merits something more than common:
     All these were unobjectionable matches,
     And might go on, if well wound up, like watches.

     There was Miss Millpond, smooth as summer's sea,
       That usual paragon, an only daughter,
     Who seem'd the cream of equanimity
       Till skimm'd--and then there was some milk and water,
     With a slight shade of blue too, it might be,
       Beneath the surface; but what did it matter?
     Love 's riotous, but marriage should have quiet,
     And being consumptive, live on a milk diet.

     And then there was the Miss Audacia Shoestring,
       A dashing demoiselle of good estate,
     Whose heart was fix'd upon a star or blue string;
       But whether English dukes grew rare of late,
     Or that she had not harp'd upon the true string,
       By which such sirens can attract our great,
     She took up with some foreign younger brother,
     A Russ or Turk--the one 's as good as t' other.

     And then there was--but why should I go on,
       Unless the ladies should go off?--there was
     Indeed a certain fair and fairy one,
       Of the best class, and better than her class,--
     Aurora Raby, a young star who shone
       O'er life, too sweet an image for such glass,
     A lovely being, scarcely form'd or moulded,
     A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded;

     Rich, noble, but an orphan; left an only
       Child to the care of guardians good and kind;
     But still her aspect had an air so lonely!
       Blood is not water; and where shall we find
     Feelings of youth like those which overthrown lie
       By death, when we are left, alas! behind,
     To feel, in friendless palaces, a home
     Is wanting, and our best ties in the tomb?

     Early in years, and yet more infantine
       In figure, she had something of sublime
     In eyes which sadly shone, as seraphs' shine.
       All youth--but with an aspect beyond time;
     Radiant and grave--as pitying man's decline;
       Mournful--but mournful of another's crime,
     She look'd as if she sat by Eden's door.
     And grieved for those who could return no more.

     She was a Catholic, too, sincere, austere,
       As far as her own gentle heart allow'd,
     And deem'd that fallen worship far more dear
       Perhaps because 't was fallen: her sires were proud
     Of deeds and days when they had fill'd the ear
       Of nations, and had never bent or bow'd
     To novel power; and as she was the last,
     She held their old faith and old feelings fast.

     She gazed upon a world she scarcely knew,
       As seeking not to know it; silent, lone,
     As grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,
       And kept her heart serene within its zone.
     There was awe in the homage which she drew;
       Her spirit seem'd as seated on a throne
     Apart from the surrounding world, and strong
     In its own strength--most strange in one so young!

     Now it so happen'd, in the catalogue
       Of Adeline, Aurora was omitted,
     Although her birth and wealth had given her vogue
       Beyond the charmers we have already cited;
     Her beauty also seem'd to form no clog
       Against her being mention'd as well fitted,
     By many virtues, to be worth the trouble
     Of single gentlemen who would be double.

     And this omission, like that of the bust
       Of Brutus at the pageant of Tiberius,
     Made Juan wonder, as no doubt he must.
       This he express'd half smiling and half serious;
     When Adeline replied with some disgust,
       And with an air, to say the least, imperious,
     She marvell'd 'what he saw in such a baby
     As that prim, silent, cold Aurora Raby?'

     Juan rejoin'd--'She was a Catholic,
       And therefore fittest, as of his persuasion;
     Since he was sure his mother would fall sick,
       And the Pope thunder excommunication,
     If-' But here Adeline, who seem'd to pique
       Herself extremely on the inoculation
     Of others with her own opinions, stated--
     As usual--the same reason which she late did.

     And wherefore not? A reasonable reason,
       If good, is none the worse for repetition;
     If bad, the best way 's certainly to tease on,
       And amplify: you lose much by concision,
     Whereas insisting in or out of season
       Convinces all men, even a politician;
     Or--what is just the same--it wearies out.
     So the end 's gain'd, what signifies the route?

     Why Adeline had this slight prejudice--
       For prejudice it was--against a creature
     As pure as sanctity itself from vice,
       With all the added charm of form and feature,
     For me appears a question far too nice,
       Since Adeline was liberal by nature;
     But nature 's nature, and has more caprices
     Than I have time, or will, to take to pieces.

     Perhaps she did not like the quiet way
       With which Aurora on those baubles look'd,
     Which charm most people in their earlier day:
       For there are few things by mankind less brook'd,
     And womankind too, if we so may say,
       Than finding thus their genius stand rebuked,
     Like 'Anthony's by Caesar,' by the few
     Who look upon them as they ought to do.

     It was not envy--Adeline had none;
       Her place was far beyond it, and her mind.
     It was not scorn--which could not light on one
       Whose greatest fault was leaving few to find.
     It was not jealousy, I think: but shun
       Following the 'ignes fatui' of mankind.
     It was not--but 't is easier far, alas!
     To say what it was not than what it was.

     Little Aurora deem'd she was the theme
       Of such discussion. She was there a guest;
     A beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream
       Of rank and youth, though purer than the rest,
     Which flow'd on for a moment in the beam
       Time sheds a moment o'er each sparkling crest.
     Had she known this, she would have calmly smiled--
     She had so much, or little, of the child.

     The dashing and proud air of Adeline
       Imposed not upon her: she saw her blaze
     Much as she would have seen a glow-worm shine,
       Then turn'd unto the stars for loftier rays.
     Juan was something she could not divine,
       Being no sibyl in the new world's ways;
     Yet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor,
     Because she did not pin her faith on feature.

     His fame too,--for he had that kind of fame
       Which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind,
     A heterogeneous mass of glorious blame,
       Half virtues and whole vices being combined;
     Faults which attract because they are not tame;
       Follies trick'd out so brightly that they blind:--
     These seals upon her wax made no impression,
     Such was her coldness or her self-possession.

     Juan knew nought of such a character--
       High, yet resembling not his lost Haidee;
     Yet each was radiant in her proper sphere:
       The island girl, bred up by the lone sea,
     More warm, as lovely, and not less sincere,
       Was Nature's all: Aurora could not be,
     Nor would be thus:--the difference in them
     Was such as lies between a flower and gem.

     Having wound up with this sublime comparison,
       Methinks we may proceed upon our narrative,
     And, as my friend Scott says, 'I sound my warison;'
       Scott, the superlative of my comparative--
     Scott, who can paint your Christian knight or Saracen,
       Serf, lord, man, with such skill as none would share it, if
     There had not been one Shakspeare and Voltaire,
     Of one or both of whom he seems the heir.

     I say, in my slight way I may proceed
       To play upon the surface of humanity.
     I write the world, nor care if the world read,
       At least for this I cannot spare its vanity.
     My Muse hath bred, and still perhaps may breed
       More foes by this same scroll: when I began it, I
     Thought that it might turn out so--now I know it,
     But still I am, or was, a pretty poet.

     The conference or congress (for it ended
       As congresses of late do) of the Lady
     Adeline and Don Juan rather blended
       Some acids with the sweets--for she was heady;
     But, ere the matter could be marr'd or mended,
       The silvery bell rang, not for 'dinner ready,
     But for that hour, call'd half-hour, given to dress,
     Though ladies' robes seem scant enough for less.

     Great things were now to be achieved at table,
       With massy plate for armour, knives and forks
     For weapons; but what Muse since Homer 's able
       (His feasts are not the worst part of his works)
     To draw up in array a single day-bill
       Of modern dinners? where more mystery lurks,
     In soups or sauces, or a sole ragout,

     There was a goodly 'soupe a la bonne femme,'
       Though God knows whence it came from; there was, too,
     A turbot for relief of those who cram,
       Relieved with 'dindon a la Parigeux;'
       How shall I get this gourmand stanza through?-
     'Soupe a la Beauveau,' whose relief was dory,
     Relieved itself by pork, for greater glory.

     But I must crowd all into one grand mess
       Or mass; for should I stretch into detail,
     My Muse would run much more into excess,
       Than when some squeamish people deem her frail.
     But though a 'bonne vivante,' I must confess
       Her stomach 's not her peccant part; this tale
     However doth require some slight refection,
     Just to relieve her spirits from dejection.

     Fowls 'a la Conde,' slices eke of salmon,
       With 'sauces Genevoises,' and haunch of venison;
     Wines too, which might again have slain young Ammon--
       A man like whom I hope we shan't see many soon;
     They also set a glazed Westphalian ham on,
       Whereon Apicius would bestow his benison;
     And then there was champagne with foaming whirls,
     As white as Cleopatra's melted pearls.

     Then there was God knows what 'a l'Allemande,'
       'A l'Espagnole,' 'timballe,' and 'salpicon'-
     With things I can't withstand or understand,
       Though swallow'd with much zest upon the whole;
     And 'entremets' to piddle with at hand,
       Gently to lull down the subsiding soul;
     While great Lucullus' Robe triumphal muffles
     (There 's fame) young partridge fillets, deck'd with truffles.

     What are the fillets on the victor's brow
       To these? They are rags or dust. Where is the arch
     Which nodded to the nation's spoils below?
       Where the triumphal chariots' haughty march?
     Gone to where victories must like dinners go.
       Farther I shall not follow the research:
     But oh! ye modern heroes with your cartridges,
     When will your names lend lustre e'en to partridges?

     Those truffles too are no bad accessaries,
       Follow'd by 'petits puits d'amour'--a dish
     Of which perhaps the cookery rather varies,
       So every one may dress it to his wish,
     According to the best of dictionaries,
       Which encyclopedize both flesh and fish;
     But even sans 'confitures,' it no less true is,
     There 's pretty picking in those 'petits puits.'

     The mind is lost in mighty contemplation
       Of intellect expanded on two courses;
     And indigestion's grand multiplication
       Requires arithmetic beyond my forces.
     Who would suppose, from Adam's simple ration,
       That cookery could have call'd forth such resources,
     As form a science and a nomenclature
     From out the commonest demands of nature?

     The glasses jingled, and the palates tingled;
       The diners of celebrity dined well;
     The ladies with more moderation mingled
       In the feast, pecking less than I can tell;
     Also the younger men too: for a springald
       Can't, like ripe age, in gormandize excel,
     But thinks less of good eating than the whisper
     (When seated next him) of some pretty lisper.

     Alas! I must leave undescribed the gibier,
       The salmi, the consomme, the puree,
     All which I use to make my rhymes run glibber
       Than could roast beef in our rough John Bull way:
     I must not introduce even a spare rib here,
       'Bubble and squeak' would spoil my liquid lay:
     But I have dined, and must forego, Alas!
     The chaste description even of a 'becasse;'

     And fruits, and ice, and all that art refines
       From nature for the service of the gout--
     Taste or the gout,--pronounce it as inclines
       Your stomach! Ere you dine, the French will do;
     But after, there are sometimes certain signs
       Which prove plain English truer of the two.
     Hast ever had the gout? I have not had it--
     But I may have, and you too, reader, dread it.

     The simple olives, best allies of wine,
       Must I pass over in my bill of fare?
     I must, although a favourite 'plat' of mine
       In Spain, and Lucca, Athens, every where:
     On them and bread 't was oft my luck to dine,
       The grass my table-cloth, in open-air,
     On Sunium or Hymettus, like Diogenes,
     Of whom half my philosophy the progeny is.

     Amidst this tumult of fish, flesh, and 'fowl,
       And vegetables, all in masquerade,
     The guests were placed according to their roll,
       But various as the various meats display'd:
     Don Juan sat next 'an l'Espagnole'-
       No damsel, but a dish, as hath been said;
     But so far like a lady, that 't was drest
     Superbly, and contain'd a world of zest.

     By some odd chance too, he was placed between
       Aurora and the Lady Adeline--
     A situation difficult, I ween,
       For man therein, with eyes and heart, to dine.
     Also the conference which we have seen
       Was not such as to encourage him to shine;
     For Adeline, addressing few words to him,
     With two transcendent eyes seem'd to look through him.

     I sometimes almost think that eyes have ears:
       This much is sure, that, out of earshot, things
     Are somehow echoed to the pretty dears,
       Of which I can't tell whence their knowledge springs.
     Like that same mystic music of the spheres,
       Which no one bears, so loudly though it rings,
     'T is wonderful how oft the sex have heard
     Long dialogues--which pass'd without a word!

     Aurora sat with that indifference
       Which piques a preux chevalier--as it ought:
     Of all offences that 's the worst offence,
       Which seems to hint you are not worth a thought.
     Now Juan, though no coxcomb in pretence,
       Was not exactly pleased to be so caught;
     Like a good ship entangled among ice,
     And after so much excellent advice.

     To his gay nothings, nothing was replied,
       Or something which was nothing, as urbanity
     Required. Aurora scarcely look'd aside,
       Nor even smiled enough for any vanity.
     The devil was in the girl! Could it be pride?
       Or modesty, or absence, or inanity?
     Heaven knows? But Adeline's malicious eyes
     Sparkled with her successful prophecies,

     And look'd as much as if to say, 'I said it;'
       A kind of triumph I 'll not recommend,
     Because it sometimes, as I have seen or read it,
       Both in the case of lover and of friend,
     Will pique a gentleman, for his own credit,
       To bring what was a jest to a serious end:
     For all men prophesy what is or was,
     And hate those who won't let them come to pass.

     Juan was drawn thus into some attentions,
       Slight but select, and just enough to express,
     To females of perspicuous comprehensions,
       That he would rather make them more than less.
     Aurora at the last (so history mentions,
       Though probably much less a fact than guess)
     So far relax'd her thoughts from their sweet prison,
     As once or twice to smile, if not to listen.

     From answering she began to question; this
       With her was rare: and Adeline, who as yet
     Thought her predictions went not much amiss,
       Began to dread she'd thaw to a coquette--
     So very difficult, they say, it is
       To keep extremes from meeting, when once set
     In motion; but she here too much refined--
     Aurora's spirit was not of that kind.

     But Juan had a sort of winning way,
       A proud humility, if such there be,
     Which show'd such deference to what females say,
       As if each charming word were a decree.
     His tact, too, temper'd him from grave to gay,
       And taught him when to be reserved or free:
     He had the art of drawing people out,
     Without their seeing what he was about.

     Aurora, who in her indifference
       Confounded him in common with the crowd
     Of flatterers, though she deem'd he had more sense
       Than whispering foplings, or than witlings loud--
     Commenced (from such slight things will great commence)
       To feel that flattery which attracts the proud
     Rather by deference than compliment,
     And wins even by a delicate dissent.

     And then he had good looks;--that point was carried
       Nem. con. amongst the women, which I grieve
     To say leads oft to crim. con. with the married--
       A case which to the juries we may leave,
     Since with digressions we too long have tarried.
       Now though we know of old that looks deceive,
     And always have done, somehow these good looks
     Make more impression than the best of books.

     Aurora, who look'd more on books than faces,
       Was very young, although so very sage,
     Admiring more Minerva than the Graces,
       Especially upon a printed page.
     But Virtue's self, with all her tightest laces,
       Has not the natural stays of strict old age;
     And Socrates, that model of all duty,
     Own'd to a penchant, though discreet, for beauty.

     And girls of sixteen are thus far Socratic,
       But innocently so, as Socrates;
     And really, if the sage sublime and Attic
       At seventy years had phantasies like these,
     Which Plato in his dialogues dramatic
       Has shown, I know not why they should displease
     In virgins--always in a modest way,
     Observe; for that with me 's a 'sine qua.'

     Also observe, that, like the great Lord Coke
       (See Littleton), whene'er I have express'd
     Opinions two, which at first sight may look
       Twin opposites, the second is the best.
     Perhaps I have a third, too, in a nook,
       Or none at all--which seems a sorry jest:
     But if a writer should be quite consistent,
     How could he possibly show things existent?

     If people contradict themselves, can
       Help contradicting them, and every body,
     Even my veracious self?--But that 's a lie:
       I never did so, never will--how should I?
     He who doubts all things nothing can deny:
       Truth's fountains may be clear--her streams are muddy,
     And cut through such canals of contradiction,
     That she must often navigate o'er fiction.

     Apologue, fable, poesy, and parable,
       Are false, but may he render'd also true,
     By those who sow them in a land that 's arable.
       'T is wonderful what fable will not do!
     'T is said it makes reality more bearable:
       But what 's reality? Who has its clue?
     Philosophy? No: she too much rejects.
     Religion? Yes; but which of all her sects?

     Some millions must be wrong, that 's pretty dear;
       Perhaps it may turn out that all were right.
     God help us! Since we have need on our career
       To keep our holy beacons always bright,
     'T is time that some new prophet should appear,
       Or old indulge man with a second sight.
     Opinions wear out in some thousand years,
     Without a small refreshment from the spheres.

     But here again, why will I thus entangle
       Myself with metaphysics? None can hate
     So much as I do any kind of wrangle;
       And yet, such is my folly, or my fate,
     I always knock my head against some angle
       About the present, past, or future state.
     Yet I wish well to Trojan and to Tyrian,
     For I was bred a moderate Presbyterian.

     But though I am a temperate theologian,
       And also meek as a metaphysician,
     Impartial between Tyrian and Trojan,
       As Eldon on a lunatic commission--
     In politics my duty is to show John
       Bull something of the lower world's condition.
     It makes my blood boil like the springs of Hecla,
     To see men let these scoundrel sovereigns break law.

     But politics, and policy, and piety,
       Are topics which I sometimes introduce,
     Not only for the sake of their variety,
       But as subservient to a moral use;
     Because my business is to dress society,
       And stuff with sage that very verdant goose.
     And now, that we may furnish with some matter all
     Tastes, we are going to try the supernatural.

     And now I will give up all argument;
       And positively henceforth no temptation
     Shall 'fool me to the top up of my bent:'-
       Yes, I' ll begin a thorough reformation.
     Indeed, I never knew what people meant
       By deeming that my Muse's conversation
     Was dangerous;--I think she is as harmless
     As some who labour more and yet may charm less.

     Grim reader! did you ever see a ghost?
       No; but you have heard--I understand--be dumb!
     And don't regret the time you may have lost,
       For you have got that pleasure still to come:
     And do not think I mean to sneer at most
       Of these things, or by ridicule benumb
     That source of the sublime and the mysterious:--
     For certain reasons my belief is serious.

     Serious? You laugh;--you may: that will I not;
       My smiles must be sincere or not at all.
     I say I do believe a haunted spot
       Exists--and where? That shall I not recall,
     Because I 'd rather it should be forgot,
       'Shadows the soul of Richard' may appal.
     In short, upon that subject I 've some qualms very
     Like those of the philosopher of Malmsbury.

     The night (I sing by night--sometimes an owl,
       And now and then a nightingale) is dim,
     And the loud shriek of sage Minerva's fowl
       Rattles around me her discordant hymn:
     Old portraits from old walls upon me scowl--
       I wish to heaven they would not look so grim;
     The dying embers dwindle in the grate--
     I think too that I have sate up too late:

     And therefore, though 't is by no means my way
       To rhyme at noon--when I have other things
     To think of, if I ever think--I say
       I feel some chilly midnight shudderings,
     And prudently postpone, until mid-day,
       Treating a topic which, alas! but brings
     Shadows;--but you must be in my condition
     Before you learn to call this superstition.




CANTO THE SIXTEENTH.

     The antique Persians taught three useful things,
       To draw the bow, to ride, and speak the truth.
     This was the mode of Cyrus, best of kings--
       A mode adopted since by modern youth.
     Bows have they, generally with two strings;
       Horses they ride without remorse or ruth;
     At speaking truth perhaps they are less clever,
     But draw the long bow better now than ever.

     The cause of this effect, or this defect,--
       'For this effect defective comes by cause,'-
     Is what I have not leisure to inspect;
       But this I must say in my own applause,
     Of all the Muses that I recollect,
       Whate'er may be her follies or her flaws
     In some things, mine 's beyond all contradiction
     The most sincere that ever dealt in fiction.

     And as she treats all things, and ne'er retreats
       From any thing, this epic will contain
     A wilderness of the most rare conceits,
       Which you might elsewhere hope to find in vain.
     'T is true there be some bitters with the sweets,
       Yet mix'd so slightly, that you can't complain,
     But wonder they so few are, since my tale is
     'De rebus cunctis et quibusdam aliis.'

     But of all truths which she has told, the most
       True is that which she is about to tell.
     I said it was a story of a ghost--
       What then? I only know it so befell.
     Have you explored the limits of the coast,
       Where all the dwellers of the earth must dwell?
     'T is time to strike such puny doubters dumb as
     The sceptics who would not believe Columbus.

     Some people would impose now with authority,
       Turpin's or Monmouth Geoffry's Chronicle;
     Men whose historical superiority
       Is always greatest at a miracle.
     But Saint Augustine has the great priority,
       Who bids all men believe the impossible,
     Because 't is so. Who nibble, scribble, quibble, he
     Quiets at once with 'quia impossibile.'

     And therefore, mortals, cavil not at all;
       Believe:--if 't is improbable you must,
     And if it is impossible, you shall:
       'T is always best to take things upon trust.
     I do not speak profanely, to recall
       Those holier mysteries which the wise and just
     Receive as gospel, and which grow more rooted,
     As all truths must, the more they are disputed:

     I merely mean to say what Johnson said,
       That in the course of some six thousand years,
     All nations have believed that from the dead
       A visitant at intervals appears;
     And what is strangest upon this strange head,
       Is, that whatever bar the reason rears
     'Gainst such belief, there 's something stronger still
     In its behalf, let those deny who will.

     The dinner and the soiree too were done,
       The supper too discuss'd, the dames admired,
     The banqueteers had dropp'd off one by one--
       The song was silent, and the dance expired:
     The last thin petticoats were vanish'd, gone
       Like fleecy Clouds into the sky retired,
     And nothing brighter gleam'd through the saloon
     Than dying tapers--and the peeping moon.

     The evaporation of a joyous day
       Is like the last glass of champagne, without
     The foam which made its virgin bumper gay;
       Or like a system coupled with a doubt;
     Or like a soda bottle when its spray
       Has sparkled and let half its spirit out;
     Or like a billow left by storms behind,
     Without the animation of the wind;

     Or like an opiate, which brings troubled rest,
       Or none; or like--like nothing that I know
     Except itself;--such is the human breast;
       A thing, of which similitudes can show
     No real likeness,--like the old Tyrian vest
       Dyed purple, none at present can tell how,
     If from a shell-fish or from cochineal.
     So perish every tyrant's robe piece-meal!

     But next to dressing for a rout or ball,
       Undressing is a woe; our robe de chambre
     May sit like that of Nessus, and recall
       Thoughts quite as yellow, but less clear than amber.
     Titus exclaim'd, 'I 've lost a day!' Of all
       The nights and days most people can remember
     (I have had of both, some not to be disdain'd),
     I wish they 'd state how many they have gain'd.

     And Juan, on retiring for the night,
       Felt restless, and perplex'd, and compromised:
     He thought Aurora Raby's eyes more bright
       Than Adeline (such is advice) advised;
     If he had known exactly his own plight,
       He probably would have philosophised:
     A great resource to all, and ne'er denied
     Till wanted; therefore Juan only sigh'd.

     He sigh'd;--the next resource is the full moon,
       Where all sighs are deposited; and now
     It happen'd luckily, the chaste orb shone
       As clear as such a climate will allow;
     And Juan's mind was in the proper tone
       To hail her with the apostrophe--'O thou!'
     Of amatory egotism the Tuism,
     Which further to explain would be a truism.

     But lover, poet, or astronomer,
       Shepherd, or swain, whoever may behold,
     Feel some abstraction when they gaze on her:
       Great thoughts we catch from thence (besides a cold
     Sometimes, unless my feelings rather err);
       Deep secrets to her rolling light are told;
     The ocean's tides and mortals' brains she sways,
     And also hearts, if there be truth in lays.

     Juan felt somewhat pensive, and disposed
       For contemplation rather than his pillow:
     The Gothic chamber, where he was enclosed,
       Let in the rippling sound of the lake's billow,
     With all the mystery by midnight caused;
       Below his window waved (of course) a willow;
     And he stood gazing out on the cascade
     That flash'd and after darken'd in the shade.

     Upon his table or his toilet,--which
       Of these is not exactly ascertain'd
     (I state this, for I am cautious to a pitch
       Of nicety, where a fact is to be gain'd),--
     A lamp burn'd high, while he leant from a niche,
       Where many a Gothic ornament remain'd,
     In chisell'd stone and painted glass, and all
     That time has left our fathers of their hall.

     Then, as the night was clear though cold, he threw
       His chamber door wide open--and went forth
     Into a gallery, of a sombre hue,
       Long, furnish'd with old pictures of great worth,
     Of knights and dames heroic and chaste too,
       As doubtless should be people of high birth.
     But by dim lights the portraits of the dead
     Have something ghastly, desolate, and dread.

     The forms of the grim knight and pictured saint
       Look living in the moon; and as you turn
     Backward and forward to the echoes faint
       Of your own footsteps--voices from the urn
     Appear to wake, and shadows wild and quaint
       Start from the frames which fence their aspects stern,
     As if to ask how you can dare to keep
     A vigil there, where all but death should sleep.

     And the pale smile of beauties in the grave,
       The charms of other days, in starlight gleams,
     Glimmer on high; their buried locks still wave
       Along the canvas; their eyes glance like dreams
     On ours, or spars within some dusky cave,
       But death is imaged in their shadowy beams.
     A picture is the past; even ere its frame
     Be gilt, who sate hath ceased to be the same.

     As Juan mused on mutability,
       Or on his mistress--terms synonymous--
     No sound except the echo of his sigh
       Or step ran sadly through that antique house;
     When suddenly he heard, or thought so, nigh,
       A supernatural agent--or a mouse,
     Whose little nibbling rustle will embarrass
     Most people as it plays along the arras.

     It was no mouse, but lo! a monk, array'd
       In cowl and beads and dusky garb, appear'd,
     Now in the moonlight, and now lapsed in shade,
       With steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard;
     His garments only a slight murmur made;
       He moved as shadowy as the sisters weird,
     But slowly; and as he pass'd Juan by,
     Glanced, without pausing, on him a bright eye.

     Juan was petrified; he had heard a hint
       Of such a spirit in these halls of old,
     But thought, like most men, there was nothing in 't
       Beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,
     Coin'd from surviving superstition's mint,
       Which passes ghosts in currency like gold,
     But rarely seen, like gold compared with paper.
     And did he see this? or was it a vapour?

     Once, twice, thrice pass'd, repass'd--the thing of air,
       Or earth beneath, or heaven, or t' other place;
     And Juan gazed upon it with a stare,
       Yet could not speak or move; but, on its base
     As stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair
       Twine like a knot of snakes around his face;
     He tax'd his tongue for words, which were not granted,
     To ask the reverend person what he wanted.

     The third time, after a still longer pause,
       The shadow pass'd away--but where? the hall
     Was long, and thus far there was no great cause
       To think his vanishing unnatural:
     Doors there were many, through which, by the laws
       Of physics, bodies whether short or tall
     Might come or go; but Juan could not state
     Through which the spectre seem'd to evaporate.

     He stood--how long he knew not, but it seem'd
       An age--expectant, powerless, with his eyes
     Strain'd on the spot where first the figure gleam'd;
       Then by degrees recall'd his energies,
     And would have pass'd the whole off as a dream,
       But could not wake; he was, he did surmise,
     Waking already, and return'd at length
     Back to his chamber, shorn of half his strength.

     All there was as he left it: still his taper
       Burnt, and not blue, as modest tapers use,
     Receiving sprites with sympathetic vapour;
       He rubb'd his eyes, and they did not refuse
     Their office; he took up an old newspaper;
       The paper was right easy to peruse;
     He read an article the king attacking,
     And a long eulogy of 'patent blacking.'

     This savour'd of this world; but his hand shook--
       He shut his door, and after having read
     A paragraph, I think about Horne Tooke,
       Undrest, and rather slowly went to bed.
     There, couch'd all snugly on his pillow's nook,
       With what he had seen his phantasy he fed;
     And though it was no opiate, slumber crept
     Upon him by degrees, and so he slept.

     He woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,
       Ponder'd upon his visitant or vision,
     And whether it ought not to be disclosed,
       At risk of being quizz'd for superstition.
     The more he thought, the more his mind was posed:
       In the mean time, his valet, whose precision
     Was great, because his master brook'd no less,
     Knock'd to inform him it was time to dress.

     He dress'd; and like young people he was wont
       To take some trouble with his toilet, but
     This morning rather spent less time upon 't;
       Aside his very mirror soon was put;
     His curls fell negligently o'er his front,
       His clothes were not curb'd to their usual cut,
     His very neckcloth's Gordian knot was tied
     Almost an hair's breadth too much on one side.

     And when he walk'd down into the saloon,
       He sate him pensive o'er a dish of tea,
     Which he perhaps had not discover'd soon,
       Had it not happen'd scalding hot to be,
     Which made him have recourse unto his spoon;
       So much distrait he was, that all could see
     That something was the matter--Adeline
     The first--but what she could not well divine.

     She look'd, and saw him pale, and turn'd as pale
       Herself; then hastily look'd down, and mutter'd
     Something, but what 's not stated in my tale.
       Lord Henry said his muffin was ill butter'd;
     The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke play'd with her veil,
       And look'd at Juan hard, but nothing utter'd.
     Aurora Raby with her large dark eyes
     Survey'd him with a kind of calm surprise.

     But seeing him all cold and silent still,
       And everybody wondering more or less,
     Fair Adeline enquired, 'If he were ill?'
       He started, and said, 'Yes--no--rather--yes.'
     The family physician had great skill,
       And being present, now began to express
     His readiness to feel his pulse and tell
     The cause, but Juan said, 'He was quite well.'

     'Quite well; yes,--no.'--These answers were mysterious,
       And yet his looks appear'd to sanction both,
     However they might savour of delirious;
       Something like illness of a sudden growth
     Weigh'd on his spirit, though by no means serious:
       But for the rest, as he himself seem'd loth
     To state the case, it might be ta'en for granted
     It was not the physician that he wanted.

     Lord Henry, who had now discuss'd his chocolate,
       Also the muffin whereof he complain'd,
     Said, Juan had not got his usual look elate,
       At which he marvell'd, since it had not rain'd;
     Then ask'd her Grace what news were of the duke of late?
       Her Grace replied, his Grace was rather pain'd
     With some slight, light, hereditary twinges
     Of gout, which rusts aristocratic hinges.

     Then Henry turn'd to Juan, and address'd
       A few words of condolence on his state:
     'You look,' quoth he, 'as if you had had your rest
       Broke in upon by the Black Friar of late.'
     'What friar?' said Juan; and he did his best
       To put the question with an air sedate,
     Or careless; but the effort was not valid
     To hinder him from growing still more pallid.

     'Oh! have you never heard of the Black Friar?
       The spirit of these walls?'--'In truth not I.'
     'Why Fame--but Fame you know 's sometimes a liar--
       Tells an odd story, of which by and by:
     Whether with time the spectre has grown shyer,
       Or that our sires had a more gifted eye
     For such sights, though the tale is half believed,
     The friar of late has not been oft perceived.

       (Who watch'd the changes of Don Juan's brow,
     And from its context thought she could divine
       Connexions stronger then he chose to avow
     With this same legend)--'if you but design
       To jest, you 'll choose some other theme just now,
     Because the present tale has oft been told,
     And is not much improved by growing old.'

     'Jest!' quoth Milor; 'why, Adeline, you know
       That we ourselves--'t was in the honey-moon--
       But, come, I 'll set your story to a tune.'
     Graceful as Dian, when she draws her bow,
       She seized her harp, whose strings were kindled soon
     As touch'd, and plaintively began to play
     The air of ''T was a Friar of Orders Gray.'

     'But add the words,' cried Henry, 'which you made;
       For Adeline is half a poetess,'
     Turning round to the rest, he smiling said.
       Of course the others could not but express
     In courtesy their wish to see display'd
       By one three talents, for there were no less--
     The voice, the words, the harper's skill, at once
     Could hardly be united by a dunce.

     After some fascinating hesitation,--
       The charming of these charmers, who seem bound,
     I can't tell why, to this dissimulation,--
       Fair Adeline, with eyes fix'd on the ground
     At first, then kindling into animation,
       Added her sweet voice to the lyric sound,
     And sang with much simplicity,--a merit
     Not the less precious, that we seldom hear it.

          Beware! beware! of the Black Friar,
            Who sitteth by Norman stone,
          For he mutters his prayer in the midnight air,
            And his mass of the days that are gone.
          When the Lord of the Hill, Amundeville,
            Made Norman Church his prey,
          And expell'd the friars, one friar still
            Would not be driven away.

          Though he came in his might, with King Henry's right,
            To turn church lands to lay,
          With sword in hand, and torch to light
            Their walls, if they said nay;
          A monk remain'd, unchased, unchain'd,
            And he did not seem form'd of clay,
          For he 's seen in the porch, and he 's seen in the church,
            Though he is not seen by day.

          And whether for good, or whether for ill,
            It is not mine to say;
          But still with the house of Amundeville
            He abideth night and day.
          By the marriage-bed of their lords, 't is said,
            He flits on the bridal eve;
          And 't is held as faith, to their bed of death
            He comes--but not to grieve.

          When an heir is born, he 's heard to mourn,
            And when aught is to befall
          That ancient line, in the "we moonshine
            He walks from hall to hall.
          His form you may trace, but not his face,
            'T is shadow'd by his cowl;
          But his eyes may be seen from the folds between,
            And they seem of a parted soul.

          But beware! beware! of the Black Friar,
            He still retains his sway,
          For he is yet the church's heir
            Whoever may be the lay.
          Amundeville is lord by day,
            But the monk is lord by night;
          Nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal
            To question that friar's right.

          Say nought to him as he walks the hall,
            And he 'll say nought to you;
          He sweeps along in his dusky pall,
            As o'er the grass the dew.
          Then grammercy! for the Black Friar;
            Heaven sain him, fair or foul!
          And whatsoe'er may be his prayer,
            Let ours be for his soul.

     The lady's voice ceased, and the thrilling wires
       Died from the touch that kindled them to sound;
     And the pause follow'd, which when song expires
       Pervades a moment those who listen round;
     And then of course the circle much admires,
       Nor less applauds, as in politeness bound,
     The tones, the feeling, and the execution,
     To the performer's diffident confusion.

     Fair Adeline, though in a careless way,
       As if she rated such accomplishment
     As the mere pastime of an idle day,
       Pursued an instant for her own content,
     Would now and then as 't were without display,
       Yet with display in fact, at times relent
     To such performances with haughty smile,
     To show she could, if it were worth her while.

     Now this (but we will whisper it aside)
       Was--pardon the pedantic illustration--
     Trampling on Plato's pride with greater pride,
       As did the Cynic on some like occasion;
     Deeming the sage would be much mortified,
       Or thrown into a philosophic passion,
     For a spoil'd carpet--but the 'Attic Bee'
     Was much consoled by his own repartee.

     Thus Adeline would throw into the shade
       (By doing easily, whene'er she chose,
     What dilettanti do with vast parade)
       Their sort of half profession; for it grows
     To something like this when too oft display'd;
       And that it is so everybody knows
     Who have heard Miss That or This, or Lady T'other,
     Show off--to please their company or mother.

     O! the long evenings of duets and trios!
       The admirations and the speculations;
     The 'Mamma Mia's!' and the 'Amor Mio's!'
       The 'Tanti palpiti's' on such occasions:
     The 'Lasciami's,' and quavering 'Addio's!'
       Amongst our own most musical of nations;
     With 'Tu mi chamas's' from Portingale,
     To soothe our ears, lest Italy should fail.

     In Babylon's bravuras--as the home
       Heart-ballads of Green Erin or Gray Highlands,
     That bring Lochaber back to eyes that roam
       O'er far Atlantic continents or islands,
     The calentures of music which o'ercome
       All mountaineers with dreams that they are nigh lands,
     No more to be beheld but in such visions--
     Was Adeline well versed, as compositions.

     She also had a twilight tinge of 'Blue,'
       Could write rhymes, and compose more than she wrote,
     Made epigrams occasionally too
       Upon her friends, as everybody ought.
     But still from that sublimer azure hue,
       So much the present dye, she was remote;
     Was weak enough to deem Pope a great poet,
     And what was worse, was not ashamed to show it.

     Aurora--since we are touching upon taste,
       Which now-a-days is the thermometer
     By whose degrees all characters are class'd--
       Was more Shakspearian, if I do not err.
     The worlds beyond this world's perplexing waste
       Had more of her existence, for in her
     There was a depth of feeling to embrace
     Thoughts, boundless, deep, but silent too as Space.

     Not so her gracious, graceful, graceless Grace,
       The full-grown Hebe of Fitz-Fulke, whose mind,
     If she had any, was upon her face,
       And that was of a fascinating kind.
     A little turn for mischief you might trace
       Also thereon,--but that 's not much; we find
     Few females without some such gentle leaven,
     For fear we should suppose us quite in heaven.

     I have not heard she was at all poetic,
       Though once she was seen reading the 'Bath Guide,'
     And 'Hayley's Triumphs,' which she deem'd pathetic,
       Because she said her temper had been tried
     So much, the bard had really been prophetic
       Of what she had gone through with--since a bride.
     But of all verse, what most ensured her praise
     Were sonnets to herself, or 'bouts rimes.'

     'T were difficult to say what was the object
       Of Adeline, in bringing this same lay
     To bear on what appear'd to her the subject
       Of Juan's nervous feelings on that day.
     Perhaps she merely had the simple project
       To laugh him out of his supposed dismay;
     Perhaps she might wish to confirm him in it,
     Though why I cannot say--at least this minute.

     But so far the immediate effect
       Was to restore him to his self-propriety,
     A thing quite necessary to the elect,
       Who wish to take the tone of their society:
     In which you cannot be too circumspect,
       Whether the mode be persiflage or piety,
     But wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy,
     On pain of much displeasing the gynocracy.

     And therefore Juan now began to rally
       His spirits, and without more explanation
     To jest upon such themes in many a sally.
       Her Grace, too, also seized the same occasion,
     With various similar remarks to tally,
       But wish'd for a still more detail'd narration
     Of this same mystic friar's curious doings,
     About the present family's deaths and wooings.

     Of these few could say more than has been said;
       They pass'd as such things do, for superstition
     With some, while others, who had more in dread
       The theme, half credited the strange tradition;
     And much was talk'd on all sides on that head:
       But Juan, when cross-question'd on the vision,
     Which some supposed (though he had not avow'd it)
     Had stirr'd him, answer'd in a way to cloud it.

     And then, the mid-day having worn to one,
       The company prepared to separate;
     Some to their several pastimes, or to none,
       Some wondering 't was so early, some so late.
     There was a goodly match too, to be run
       Between some greyhounds on my lord's estate,
     And a young race-horse of old pedigree
     Match'd for the spring, whom several went to see.

     There was a picture-dealer who had brought
       A special Titian, warranted original,
     So precious that it was not to be bought,
       Though princes the possessor were besieging all.
     The king himself had cheapen'd it, but thought
       The civil list he deigns to accept (obliging all
     His subjects by his gracious acceptation)
     Too scanty, in these times of low taxation.

     But as Lord Henry was a connoisseur,--
       The friend of artists, if not arts,--the owner,
     With motives the most classical and pure,
       So that he would have been the very donor,
     Rather than seller, had his wants been fewer,
       So much he deem'd his patronage an honour,
     Had brought the capo d'opera, not for sale,
     But for his judgment--never known to fail.

     There was a modern Goth, I mean a Gothic
       Bricklayer of Babel, call'd an architect,
     Brought to survey these grey walls, which though so thick,
       Might have from time acquired some slight defect;
     Who after rummaging the Abbey through thick
       And thin, produced a plan whereby to erect
     New buildings of correctest conformation,
     And throw down old--which he call'd restoration.

     The cost would be a trifle--an 'old song,'
       Set to some thousands ('t is the usual burden
     Of that same tune, when people hum it long)--
       The price would speedily repay its worth in
     An edifice no less sublime than strong,
       By which Lord Henry's good taste would go forth in
     Its glory, through all ages shining sunny,
     For Gothic daring shown in English money.

     There were two lawyers busy on a mortgage
       Lord Henry wish'd to raise for a new purchase;
     Also a lawsuit upon tenures burgage,
       And one on tithes, which sure are Discord's torches,
     Kindling Religion till she throws down her gage,
       'Untying' squires 'to fight against the churches;'
     There was a prize ox, a prize pig, and ploughman,
     For Henry was a sort of Sabine showman.

     There were two poachers caught in a steel trap,
       Ready for gaol, their place of convalescence;
     There was a country girl in a close cap
       And scarlet cloak (I hate the sight to see, since--
     Since--since--in youth, I had the sad mishap--
       But luckily I have paid few parish fees since):
     That scarlet cloak, alas! unclosed with rigour,
     Presents the problem of a double figure.

     A reel within a bottle is a mystery,
       One can't tell how it e'er got in or out;
     Therefore the present piece of natural history
       I leave to those who are fond of solving doubt;
     And merely state, though not for the consistory,
       Lord Henry was a justice, and that Scout
     The constable, beneath a warrant's banner,
     Had bagg'd this poacher upon Nature's manor.

     Now justices of peace must judge all pieces
       Of mischief of all kinds, and keep the game
     And morals of the country from caprices
       Of those who have not a license for the same;
     And of all things, excepting tithes and leases,
       Perhaps these are most difficult to tame:
     Preserving partridges and pretty wenches
     Are puzzles to the most precautious benches.

     The present culprit was extremely pale,
       Pale as if painted so; her cheek being red
     By nature, as in higher dames less hale
       'T is white, at least when they just rise from bed.
     Perhaps she was ashamed of seeming frail,
       Poor soul! for she was country born and bred,
     And knew no better in her immorality
     Than to wax white--for blushes are for quality.

     Her black, bright, downcast, yet espiegle eye,
       Had gather'd a large tear into its corner,
     Which the poor thing at times essay'd to dry,
       For she was not a sentimental mourner
     Parading all her sensibility,
       Nor insolent enough to scorn the scorner,
     But stood in trembling, patient tribulation,
     To be call'd up for her examination.

     Of course these groups were scatter'd here and there,
       Not nigh the gay saloon of ladies gent.
     The lawyers in the study; and in air
       The prize pig, ploughman, poachers; the men sent
     From town, viz., architect and dealer, were
       Both busy (as a general in his tent
     Writing despatches) in their several stations,
     Exulting in their brilliant lucubrations.

     But this poor girl was left in the great hall,
       While Scout, the parish guardian of the frail,
     Discuss'd (he hated beer yclept the 'small')
       A mighty mug of moral double ale.
     She waited until justice could recall
       Its kind attentions to their proper pale,
     To name a thing in nomenclature rather
     Perplexing for most virgins--a child's father.

     You see here was enough of occupation
       For the Lord Henry, link'd with dogs and horses.
     There was much bustle too, and preparation
       Below stairs on the score of second courses;
     Because, as suits their rank and situation,
       Those who in counties have great land resources
     Have 'Public days,' when all men may carouse,
     Though not exactly what 's call'd 'open house.'

     But once a week or fortnight, uninvited
       (Thus we translate a general invitation),
     All country gentlemen, esquired or knighted,
       May drop in without cards, and take their station
     At the full board, and sit alike delighted
       With fashionable wines and conversation;
     And, as the isthmus of the grand connection,
     Talk o'er themselves the past and next election.

     Lord Henry was a great electioneerer,
       Burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit;
     But county contests cost him rather dearer,
       Because the neighbouring Scotch Earl of Giftgabbit
     Had English influence in the self-same sphere here;
       His son, the Honourable Dick Dicedrabbit,
     Was member for the 'other interest' (meaning
     The same self-interest, with a different leaning).

     Courteous and cautious therefore in his county,
       He was all things to all men, and dispensed
     To some civility, to others bounty,
       And promises to all--which last commenced
     To gather to a somewhat large amount, he
       Not calculating how much they condensed;
     But what with keeping some, and breaking others,
     His word had the same value as another's.

     A friend to freedom and freeholders--yet
       No less a friend to government--he held,
     That he exactly the just medium hit
       'Twixt place and patriotism--albeit compell'd,
     Such was his sovereign's pleasure (though unfit,
       He added modestly, when rebels rail'd),
     To hold some sinecures he wish'd abolish'd,
     But that with them all law would be demolish'd.

     He was 'free to confess' (whence comes this phrase?
       Is 't English? No--'t is only parliamentary)
     That innovation's spirit now-a-days
       Had made more progress than for the last century.
     He would not tread a factious path to praise,
       Though for the public weal disposed to venture high;
     As for his place, he could but say this of it,
     That the fatigue was greater than the profit.

     Heaven, and his friends, knew that a private life
       Had ever been his sole and whole ambition;
     But could he quit his king in times of strife,
       Which threaten'd the whole country with perdition?
     When demagogues would with a butcher's knife
       Cut through and through (oh! damnable incision!)
     The Gordian or the Geordi-an knot, whose strings
     Have tied together commons, lords, and kings.

     Sooner 'come lace into the civil list
       And champion him to the utmost'--he would keep it,
     Till duly disappointed or dismiss'd:
       Profit he care not for, let others reap it;
     But should the day come when place ceased to exist,
       The country would have far more cause to weep it:
     For how could it go on? Explain who can!
     He gloried in the name of Englishman.

     He was as independent--ay, much more--
       Than those who were not paid for independence,
     As common soldiers, or a common--shore,
       Have in their several arts or parts ascendance
     O'er the irregulars in lust or gore,
       Who do not give professional attendance.
     Thus on the mob all statesmen are as eager
     To prove their pride, as footmen to a beggar.

     All this (save the last stanza) Henry said,
       And thought. I say no more--I 've said too much;
     For all of us have either heard or read--
       Off--or upon the hustings--some slight such
     Hints from the independent heart or head
       Of the official candidate. I 'll touch
     No more on this--the dinner-bell hath rung,
     And grace is said; the grace I should have sung--

     But I 'm too late, and therefore must make play.
       'T was a great banquet, such as Albion old
     Was wont to boast--as if a glutton's tray
       Were something very glorious to behold.
     But 't was a public feast and public day,--
       Quite full, right dull, guests hot, and dishes cold,
     Great plenty, much formality, small cheer,
     And every body out of their own sphere.

     The squires familiarly formal, and
       My lords and ladies proudly condescending;
     The very servants puzzling how to hand
       Their plates--without it might be too much bending
     From their high places by the sideboard's stand--
       Yet, like their masters, fearful of offending.
     For any deviation from the graces
     Might cost both man and master too--their places.

     There were some hunters bold, and coursers keen,
       Whose hounds ne'er err'd, nor greyhounds deign'd to lurch;
     Some deadly shots too, Septembrizers, seen
       Earliest to rise, and last to quit the search
     Of the poor partridge through his stubble screen.
       There were some massy members of the church,
     Takers of tithes, and makers of good matches,
     And several who sung fewer psalms than catches.

     There were some country wags too--and, alas!
       Some exiles from the town, who had been driven
     To gaze, instead of pavement, upon grass,
       And rise at nine in lieu of long eleven.
     And lo! upon that day it came to pass,
       I sate next that o'erwhelming son of heaven,
     The very powerful parson, Peter Pith,
     The loudest wit I e'er was deafen'd with.

     I knew him in his livelier London days,
       A brilliant diner out, though but a curate;
     And not a joke he cut but earn'd its praise,
       Until preferment, coming at a sure rate
     (O Providence! how wondrous are thy ways!
       Who would suppose thy gifts sometimes obdurate?),
     Gave him, to lay the devil who looks o'er Lincoln,
     A fat fen vicarage, and nought to think on.

     His jokes were sermons, and his sermons jokes;
       But both were thrown away amongst the fens;
     For wit hath no great friend in aguish folks.
       No longer ready ears and short-hand pens
     Imbibed the gay bon-mot, or happy hoax:
       The poor priest was reduced to common sense,
     Or to coarse efforts very loud and long,
     To hammer a horse laugh from the thick throng.

     There is a difference, says the song, 'between
       A beggar and a queen,' or was (of late
     The latter worse used of the two we 've seen--
       But we 'll say nothing of affairs of state);
     A difference ''twixt a bishop and a dean,'
       A difference between crockery ware and plate,
     As between English beef and Spartan broth--
     And yet great heroes have been bred by both.

     But of all nature's discrepancies, none
       Upon the whole is greater than the difference
     Beheld between the country and the town,
       Of which the latter merits every preference
     From those who have few resources of their own,
       And only think, or act, or feel, with reference
     To some small plan of interest or ambition--
     Both which are limited to no condition.

     But 'en avant!' The light loves languish o'er
       Long banquets and too many guests, although
     A slight repast makes people love much more,
       Bacchus and Ceres being, as we know
     Even from our grammar upwards, friends of yore
       With vivifying Venus, who doth owe
     To these the invention of champagne and truffles:
     Temperance delights her, but long fasting ruffles.

     Dully past o'er the dinner of the day;
       And Juan took his place, he knew not where,
     Confused, in the confusion, and distrait,
       And sitting as if nail'd upon his chair:
     Though knives and forks clank'd round as in a fray,
       He seem'd unconscious of all passing there,
     Till some one, with a groan, exprest a wish
     (Unheeded twice) to have a fin of fish.

     On which, at the third asking of the bans,
       He started; and perceiving smiles around
     Broadening to grins, he colour'd more than once,
       And hastily--as nothing can confound
     A wise man more than laughter from a dunce--
       Inflicted on the dish a deadly wound,
     And with such hurry, that ere he could curb it
     He had paid his neighbour's prayer with half a turbot.

     This was no bad mistake, as it occurr'd,
       The supplicator being an amateur;
     But others, who were left with scarce a third,
       Were angry--as they well might, to be sure.
     They wonder'd how a young man so absurd
       Lord Henry at his table should endure;
     And this, and his not knowing how much oats
     Had fallen last market, cost his host three votes.

     They little knew, or might have sympathised,
       That he the night before had seen a ghost,
     A prologue which but slightly harmonised
       With the substantial company engross'd
     By matter, and so much materialised,
       That one scarce knew at what to marvel most
     Of two things--how (the question rather odd is)
     Such bodies could have souls, or souls such bodies.

     But what confused him more than smile or stare
       From all the 'squires and 'squiresses around,
     Who wonder'd at the abstraction of his air,
       Especially as he had been renown'd
     For some vivacity among the fair,
       Even in the country circle's narrow bound
     (For little things upon my lord's estate
     Were good small talk for others still less great)--

     Was, that he caught Aurora's eye on his,
       And something like a smile upon her cheek.
     Now this he really rather took amiss:
       In those who rarely smile, their smiles bespeak
     A strong external motive; and in this
       Smile of Aurora's there was nought to pique
     Or hope, or love, with any of the wiles
     Which some pretend to trace in ladies' smiles.

     'T was a mere quiet smile of contemplation,
       Indicative of some surprise and pity;
     And Juan grew carnation with vexation,
       Which was not very wise, and still less witty,
     Since he had gain'd at least her observation,
       A most important outwork of the city--
     As Juan should have known, had not his senses
     By last night's ghost been driven from their defences.

     But what was bad, she did not blush in turn,
       Nor seem embarrass'd--quite the contrary;
     Her aspect was as usual, still--not stern--
       And she withdrew, but cast not down, her eye,
     Yet grew a little pale--with what? concern?
       I know not; but her colour ne'er was high--
     Though sometimes faintly flush'd--and always clear,
     As deep seas in a sunny atmosphere.

     But Adeline was occupied by fame
       This day; and watching, witching, condescending
     To the consumers of fish, fowl, and game,
       And dignity with courtesy so blending,
     As all must blend whose part it is to aim
       (Especially as the sixth year is ending)
     At their lord's, son's, or similar connection's
     Safe conduct through the rocks of re-elections.

     Though this was most expedient on the whole,
       And usual--Juan, when he cast a glance
     On Adeline while playing her grand role,
       Which she went through as though it were a dance,
     Betraying only now and then her soul
       By a look scarce perceptibly askance
     (Of weariness or scorn), began to feel
     Some doubt how much of Adeline was real;

     So well she acted all and every part
       By turns--with that vivacious versatility,
     Which many people take for want of heart.
       They err--'t is merely what is call'd mobility,
     A thing of temperament and not of art,
       Though seeming so, from its supposed facility;
     And false--though true; for surely they 're sincerest
     Who are strongly acted on by what is nearest.

     This makes your actors, artists, and romancers,
       Heroes sometimes, though seldom--sages never;
     But speakers, bards, diplomatists, and dancers,
       Little that 's great, but much of what is clever;
     Most orators, but very few financiers,
       Though all Exchequer chancellors endeavour,
     Of late years, to dispense with Cocker's rigours,
     And grow quite figurative with their figures.

     The poets of arithmetic are they
       Who, though they prove not two and two to be
     Five, as they might do in a modest way,
       Have plainly made it out that four are three,
     Judging by what they take, and what they pay.
       The Sinking Fund's unfathomable sea,
     That most unliquidating liquid, leaves
     The debt unsunk, yet sinks all it receives.

     While Adeline dispensed her airs and graces,
       The fair Fitz-Fulke seem'd very much at ease;
     Though too well bred to quiz men to their faces,
       Her laughing blue eyes with a glance could seize
     The ridicules of people in all places--
       That honey of your fashionable bees--
     And store it up for mischievous enjoyment;
     And this at present was her kind employment.

     However, the day closed, as days must close;
       The evening also waned--and coffee came.
     Each carriage was announced, and ladies rose,
       And curtsying off, as curtsies country dame,
     Retired: with most unfashionable bows
       Their docile esquires also did the same,
     Delighted with their dinner and their host,
     But with the Lady Adeline the most.

     Some praised her beauty; others her great grace;
       The warmth of her politeness, whose sincerity
     Was obvious in each feature of her face,
       Whose traits were radiant with the rays of verity.
     Yes; she was truly worthy her high place!
       No one could envy her deserved prosperity.
     And then her dress--what beautiful simplicity
     Draperied her form with curious felicity!

     Meanwhile Sweet Adeline deserved their praises,
       By an impartial indemnification
     For all her past exertion and soft phrases,
       In a most edifying conversation,
     Which turn'd upon their late guests' miens and faces,
       And families, even to the last relation;
     Their hideous wives, their horrid selves and dresses,
     And truculent distortion of their tresses.

     True, she said little--'t was the rest that broke
       Forth into universal epigram;
     But then 't was to the purpose what she spoke:
       Like Addison's 'faint praise,' so wont to damn,
     Her own but served to set off every joke,
       As music chimes in with a melodrame.
     How sweet the task to shield an absent friend!
     I ask but this of mine, to--not defend.

     There were but two exceptions to this keen
       Skirmish of wits o'er the departed; one
     Aurora, with her pure and placid mien;
       And Juan, too, in general behind none
     In gay remark on what he had heard or seen,
       Sate silent now, his usual spirits gone:
     In vain he heard the others rail or rally,
     He would not join them in a single sally.

     'T is true he saw Aurora look as though
       She approved his silence; she perhaps mistook
     Its motive for that charity we owe
       But seldom pay the absent, nor would look
     Farther--it might or might not be so.
       But Juan, sitting silent in his nook,
     Observing little in his reverie,
     Yet saw this much, which he was glad to see.

     The ghost at least had done him this much good,
       In making him as silent as a ghost,
     If in the circumstances which ensued
       He gain'd esteem where it was worth the most.
     And certainly Aurora had renew'd
       In him some feelings he had lately lost,
     Or harden'd; feelings which, perhaps ideal,
     Are so divine, that I must deem them real:--

     The love of higher things and better days;
       The unbounded hope, and heavenly ignorance
     Of what is call'd the world, and the world's ways;
       The moments when we gather from a glance
     More joy than from all future pride or praise,
       Which kindle manhood, but can ne'er entrance
     The heart in an existence of its own,
     Of which another's bosom is the zone.

     Who would not sigh Ai ai Tan Kuuerheian
       That hath a memory, or that had a heart?
     Alas! her star must fade like that of Dian:
       Ray fades on ray, as years on years depart.
     Anacreon only had the soul to tie an
       Unwithering myrtle round the unblunted dart
     Of Eros: but though thou hast play'd us many tricks,
     Still we respect thee, 'Alma Venus Genetrix!'

     And full of sentiments, sublime as billows
       Heaving between this world and worlds beyond,
     Don Juan, when the midnight hour of pillows
       Arrived, retired to his; but to despond
     Rather than rest. Instead of poppies, willows
       Waved o'er his couch; he meditated, fond
     Of those sweet bitter thoughts which banish sleep,
     And make the worldling sneer, the youngling weep.

     The night was as before: he was undrest,
       Saving his night-gown, which is an undress;
     Completely 'sans culotte,' and without vest;
       In short, he hardly could be clothed with less:
     But apprehensive of his spectral guest,
       He sate with feelings awkward to express
     (By those who have not had such visitations),
     Expectant of the ghost's fresh operations.

     And not in vain he listen'd;--Hush! what 's that?
       I see--I see--Ah, no!--'t is not--yet 't is--
     Ye powers! it is the--the--the--Pooh! the cat!
       The devil may take that stealthy pace of his!
     So like a spiritual pit-a-pat,
       Or tiptoe of an amatory Miss,
     Gliding the first time to a rendezvous,
     And dreading the chaste echoes of her shoe.

     Again--what is 't? The wind? No, no--this time
       It is the sable friar as before,
     With awful footsteps regular as rhyme,
       Or (as rhymes may be in these days) much more.
     Again through shadows of the night sublime,
       When deep sleep fell on men, and the world wore
     The starry darkness round her like a girdle
     Spangled with gems--the monk made his blood curdle.

     A noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,
       Which sets the teeth on edge; and a slight clatter,
     Like showers which on the midnight gusts will pass,
       Sounding like very supernatural water,
     Came over Juan's ear, which throbb'd, alas!
       For immaterialism 's a serious matter;
     So that even those whose faith is the most great
     In souls immortal, shun them tete-a-tete.

     Were his eyes open?--Yes! and his mouth too.
       Surprise has this effect--to make one dumb,
     Yet leave the gate which eloquence slips through
       As wide as if a long speech were to come.
     Nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew,
       Tremendous to a mortal tympanum:
     His eyes were open, and (as was before
     Stated) his mouth. What open'd next?--the door.

     It open'd with a most infernal creak,
       Like that of hell. 'Lasciate ogni speranza
     Voi che entrate!' The hinge seem'd to speak,
       Dreadful as Dante's rhima, or this stanza;
     Or--but all words upon such themes are weak:
       A single shade 's sufficient to entrance
     Hero--for what is substance to a spirit?
     Or how is 't matter trembles to come near it?

     The door flew wide,--not swiftly, but, as fly
       The sea-gulls, with a steady, sober flight,
     And then swung back, nor close, but stood awry,
       Half letting in long shadows on the light,
     Which still in Juan's candlesticks burned high,
       For he had two, both tolerably bright,
     And in the doorway, darkening darkness, stood
     The sable Friar in his solemn hood.

     Between two worlds life hovers like a star,
       'Twixt night and morn, upon the horizon's verge.
     How little do we know that which we are!
       How less what we may be! The eternal surge
     Of time and tide rolls on, and bears afar
       Our bubbles; as the old burst, new emerge,
     Lash'd from the foam of ages; while the graves
     Of empires heave but like some passing waves.

     Don Juan shook, as erst he had been shaken
       The night before, but being sick of shaking,
     He first inclined to think he had been mistaken,
       And then to be ashamed of such mistaking.
     His own internal ghost began to awaken
       Within him and to quell his corporal quaking,
     Hinting that soul and body on the whole
     Were odds against a disembodied soul.

     And then his dread grew wrath, and his wrath fierce,
       And he arose, advanced. The shade retreated,
     But Juan, eager now the truth to pierce,
       Followed, his veins no longer cold, but heated,
     Resolved to thrust the mystery carte and tierce,
       At whatsoever risk of being defeated.
     The ghost stopped, menaced, then retired, until
     He reached the ancient wall, then stood stone still.

     Juan put forth one arm. Eternal powers!
       It touched no soul nor body, but the wall,
     On which the moonbeams fell in silvery showers
       Checkered with all the tracery of the hall.
     He shuddered, as no doubt the bravest cowers
       When he can't tell what 'tis that doth appal.
     How odd, a single hobgoblin's nonentity
     Should cause more fear than a whole host's identity.

     But still the shade remained, the blue eyes glared,
       And rather variably for stony death.
     Yet one thing rather good the grave had spared;
       The ghost had a remarkably sweet breath.
     A straggling curl showed he had been fair-haired.
       A red lip with two rows of pearls beneath
     Gleamed forth, as through the casement's ivy shroud
     The moon peeped, just escaped from a grey cloud.

     And Juan, puzzled but still curious, thrust
       His other arm forth. Wonder upon wonder!
     It pressed upon a hard but glowing bust,
      Which beat as if there was a warm heart under.
     He found, as people on most trials must,
       That he had made at first a silly blunder
     And that in his confusion he had caught
     Only the wall, instead of what he sought

     The ghost, if ghost it were, seemed a sweet soul
       As ever lurked beneath a holy hood.
     A dimpled chin, a neck of ivory stole
       Forth into something much like flesh and blood.
     Back fell the sable frock and dreary cowl
       And they revealed, alas, that ere they should,
     In full, voluptuous, but not o'ergrown bulk,
     The phantom of her frolic Grace--Fita-Fulke!

CANTO THE SEVENTEENTH.

     The world is full of orphans: firstly, those
        Who are so in the strict sense of the phrase
     (But many a lonely tree the loftier grows
        Than others crowded in the forest's maze);
     The next are such as are not doomed to lose
        Their tender parents in their budding days,
     But merely their parental tenderness,
     Which leaves them orphans of the heart no less.

     The next are 'only children', as they are styled,
        Who grow up children only, since the old saw
     Pronounces that an 'only' 's a spoilt child.
        But not to go too far, I hold it law
     That where their education, harsh or mild,
        'Transgresses the great bounds of love or awe,
     The sufferers, be't in heart or intellect,
     Whate'er the cause are orphans in effect.

     But to return unto the stricter rule
       (As far as words make rules), our common notion
     Of orphans paints at once a parish school,
        A half-starved babe, a wreck upon life's ocean,
     A human (what the Italians nickname) 'mule',
        A theme for pity or some worse emotion;
     Yet, if examined, it might be admitted
     The wealthiest orphans are to be more pitied.

     Too soon they are parents to themselves; for what
        Are tutors, guardians, and so forth, compared
     With Nature's genial genitors, so that
       A child of Chancery, that Star Chamber ward
     (I'll take the likeness I can first come at),
        Is like a duckling by Dame Partlett reared
     And frights, especially if 'tis a daughter,
     The old hen by running headlong to the water.

     There is a commonplace book argument,
       Which glibly glides from every vulgar tongue
     When any dare a new light to present:
       'If you are right, then everybody's wrong.'
     Suppose the converse of this precedent
       So often urged, so loudly and so long:
     'If you are wrong, then everybody's right.'
     Was ever everybody yet so quite?

     Therefore I would solicit free discussion
       Upon all points, no matter what or whose,
     Because as ages upon ages push on,
       The last is apt the former to accuse
     Of pillowing its head on a pincushion,
       Heedless of pricks because it was obtuse.
     What was a paradox becomes a truth or
     A something like it, as bear witness Luther.

     The sacraments have been reduced to two
       And witches unto none, though somewhat late
     Since burning aged women (save a few,
       Not witches, only bitches, who create
     Mischief in families, as some know or knew,
       Should still be singed, but slightly let me state)
     Has been declared an act of inurbanity,
     Malgé  Sir Matthew Hale's great humanity.

     Great Galileo was debarred the sun,
       Because he fixed it, and to stop his talking
     How earth could round the solar orbit run,
       Found his own legs embargoed from mere walking.
     The man was well nigh dead, ere men begun
       To think his skull had not some need of caulking,
     But now it seems he's right, his notion just,
     No doubt a consolation to his dust.

     Pythagoras, Locke, Socrates--but pages
        Might be filled up, as vainly as before,
     With the sad usage of all sorts of sages,
        Who in his lifetime each was deemed a bore.
     The loftiest minds outrun their tardy ages;
       This they must bear with and perhaps much more.
     The wise man's sure when he no more can share it, he
     Will have a firm post-obit on posterity.

     If such doom waits each intellectual giant,
      We little people in our lesser way
     To life's small rubs should surely be more pliant,
       And so for one will I, as well I may.
     Would that I were less bilious--but oh fie on't!
       Just as I make my mind up everyday
     To be a totus teres stoic, sage,
     The wind shifts and I fly into a rage.

     Temperate I am, yet never had a temper;
       Modest I am, yet with some slight assurance;
     Changeable too, yet somehow idem semper;
      Patient, but not enamoured of endurance;
     Cheerful, but sometimes rather apt to whimper;
       Mild, but at times a sort of Hercules furens;
     So that I almost think that the same skin
     For one without has two or three within.

     Our hero was in canto the sixteenth

       His vice--for he was of a kindling nation--
     Is more than I shall venture to describe,
     Unless some beauty with a kiss should bribe.

     I leave the thing a problem, like all things.
       The morning came, and breakfast, tea and toast,
     Of which most men partake, but no one sings.
       The company, whose birth, wealth, worth have cost
     My trembling lyre already several strings,
       Assembled with our hostess and mine host.
      The guests dropped in, the last but one, Her Grace,
     The latest, Juan with his virgin face.

     Which best is to encounter, ghost or none,
       'Twere difficult to say, but Juan looked
     As if he had combated with more than one,
       Being wan and worn, with eyes that hardly brooked
     The light that through the Gothic windows shone.
       Her Grace too had a sort of air rebuked,
     Seemed pale and shivered, as if she had kept
     A vigil or dreamt rather more than slept.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE


_Fugitive Pieces_, Byron's first volume of verse, was privately
printed in the autumn of 1806, when Byron was eighteen years of age.
Passages in Byron's correspondence indicate that as early as August
of that year some of the poems were in the printers' hands and that
during the latter part of August and during September the printing
was suspended in order that Byron might give his poems an "entire
new form." The new form consisted, in part, in an enlargement; for he
wrote to Elizabeth Pigot about September that he had nearly doubled
his poems "partly by the discovery of some I conceived to be lost, and
partly by some new productions." According to Moore, _Fugitive Pieces_
was ready for distribution in November. The last poem in the volume
bears the date of November 16, 1806.

A difficulty in supposing the date of completion of the volume to be
about November 16 is that two copies contain inscriptions in Byron's
hand with earlier dates. On the copy of the late Mr. J.A. Spoor,
of Chicago, the inscription reads: "October 21st Tuesday 1806--Haec
poemata ex dono sunt--Georgii Gordon Byron, Vale." That on the
copy in the Morgan library reads: "Nov. 8, 1806, H.P.E.D.S.G.G.B.,
Southwell.--Vale!--Byron," the initials evidently standing for the
Latin words of the preceding inscription. The Latin "Vale" in each
inscription, however, suggests that it commemorates a leave-taking,
the date referring not to the presentation but to the farewell.

It has been suggested that copies of the volume were distributed
earlier than November and that some of the poems, printed separately
and distributed in fly-leaf form, were added later. This would explain
such discrepancies as the early dates of the inscriptions, and the
presence of Byron's name on pages 46 and 48 in a volume otherwise
anonymous, but there is little evidence to support it.

Moore's account of _Fugitive Pieces_ is that it was distributed in
November, Byron presenting the first copy to the Reverend J.T. Becher,
prebendary of Southwell minster, who objected to what he considered
the too voluptuous coloring of the poem "To Mary." The objection led
Byron to suppress the edition immediately, he himself burning nearly
every copy. This account is corroborated in part by Miss Pigot and in
part by Byron.

Immediately after the destruction, Byron began the preparation of a
second volume, to replace _Fugitive Pieces_. This appeared in January,
1807, as _Poems on Various Occasions_, Byron describing it as "vastly
correct and miraculously chaste." Of the 38 poems that constitute
_Fugitive Pieces_, all except "To Mary," "To Caroline," and the last
six stanzas of "To Miss E.P." were reprinted in _Poems on Various
Occasions_. Nineteen of the original 38 poems occur in Byron's third
work, _Hours of Idleness_, published in June or July, 1807. All three
editions were printed by S. and J. Ridge, booksellers of Newark,
England.

Byron himself never reprinted the poems "To Mary" or "To Caroline," or
the last six stanzas of "To Miss E.P." Except in a limited facsimile
of _Fugitive Pieces_, supervised by H. Buxton Forman in 1886, "To
Mary" has never been reprinted--not even in supposedly complete
editions of Byron's works.

Only four copies of _Fugitive Pieces_ are known to-day, and one of
these is incomplete. The copy from which the present facsimile is made
was originally given by Byron to Becher and preserved by him in spite
of his objections to the poem "To Mary." From Becher's family it
passed into the possession of Mr. Faulkner, of Louth, solicitor for
the Becher family. In 1885 it was in the possession of H.W. Ball,
antiquary and bookseller of Barton-on-Humber, who sold it to H. Buxton
Forman. Forman used it for his facsimile, but incorporated certain
manuscript corrections of the original, so that his facsimile is not
exact. The original is now owned by Mr. Thomas J. Wise, who has kindly
permitted its use for the present facsimile.

Of the other three copies, the incomplete one, lacking pages 17-20
("To Mary") and all after page 58, is in the possession of the family
of the late Mr. H.C. Roe, of Nottingham. This was originally sent by
Byron to Pigot, then studying medicine in Edinburgh. Byron later asked
Pigot to destroy the copy and Pigot seems to have complied so far
as to tear out the offending verses "To Mary." For many years it was
thought that only the Pigot and Becher copies had escaped destruction
at Byron's hands. But another complete copy came to light in 1907
and is now in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. This contains
numerous manuscript corrections and alterations, and seems to have
been used as a proof copy for _Poems on Various Occasions_ (not, as
has sometimes been stated, for _Hours of Idleness_). A fourth copy,
also complete, was offered at public sale in 1912, and is now in the
hands of the executors of the late Mr. J.A. Spoor, of Chicago.

The present facsimile is an exact photographic reproduction of the
text with all typographical and other errors as in the original,
except that certain manuscript corrections which appear in the
original perforce appear in the photographic reproduction, as follows:

  Page 3, _To E_.... line 2.           "me" has been inserted by hand.

  Page 8, stanza 5, line 2.            A letter ("s"?) has been erased
                                       between "so" and "oft," and
                                       the second "e" of "meets" has
                                       been inserted to replace "l."

  Page 14, line 10.                    "j" in "jargon" has been
                                       inserted by hand.

  Page 19, stanza (11), line 1.        "night" was originally printed
                                       "might," the "m" later changed
                                       to "n" by erasure.

  Page 24, stanza 4, line 4.           "s" in "setting" has been
                                       inserted by hand.

  Page 25, _Thoughts Suggested by_     "e" in "tremble" has been
           _a College Examination_,    inserted, correcting "trimble."
           line 4.

  Page 31, line 4.                     "f" in "fast" was originally
                                       "l," but was changed by hand.

The text has been collated with that in the Morgan library, and
except for later corrections made in ink in the Morgan copy, the only
differences noted are as follows:

    1.) On p. 5, in the first line of the footnote, the Morgan
    copy reads "piece" where the Wise copy reads "p*ece," the
    "[dotless i]" lacking.

    2.) The two pages of signature M are incorrectly numbered in
    the Wise copy as "41, 41," this copy having no page numbered
    42; and are incorrectly numbered in the Morgan copy as "40,
    42," the latter copy having no page numbered 41. The text of
    these pages is identical.

ON LEAVING N--ST--D.


  Through the cracks in these battlements loud the winds whistle,
    For the hall of my fathers is gone to decay;
  And in yon once gay garden the hemlock and thistle
    Have choak'd up the rose, which late bloom'd in the way.

  Of the barons of old, who once proudly to battle
    Led their vassals from Europe to Palestine's plain;
  The escutcheon and shield, which with ev'ry blast rattle,
    Are the only sad vestiges now that remain.

  No more does old Robert, with harp-stringing numbers,
    Raise a flame in the breast, for the war laurell'd wreath,
  Near Askalon's Towers John of Horiston[1] slumbers,
    Unnerv'd is the hand of his minstrel by death.

  Paul and Hubert too sleep in the valley of Cressy,
    For the safety of Edward and ENGLAND they fell,
  My fathers! the tears of your country redress ye,
    How you fought! how you died! still her annals can tell.

  On [2]Marston with Rupert[3] 'gainst traitors contending,
    Four Brothers enrich'd with their blood the bleak field
  For Charles the Martyr their country defending,
    Till death their attachment to royalty scal'd.

  Shades of heroes farewell! your descendant departing,
    From the seat of his ancestors, bids ye adieu!
  Abroad, or at home, your remembrance imparting
    New courage, he'll think upon glory, and you.

  Though a tear dims his eye at this sad separation,
    'Tis nature, not fear, which commands his regret;
  Far distant he goes with the same emulation,
    In the grave, he alone can his fathers forget.

  Your fame, and your memory, still will he cherish,
    He vows that he ne'er will disgrace your renown;
  Like you will he live, or like you will he perish,
    When decay'd, may he mingle his dust with your own.

  Let Folly smile, to view the names

    Since title deck'd my higher birth;
  Yet envy not this gaudy state,
    _Thine_ is the pride of modest worth.

  Our _souls_ at least congenial meet,
    Nor can _thy_ lot _my_ rank disgrace;
  Our intercourse is not less sweet,
    Since worth of rank supplies the place.

  Hush'd are the winds, and still the evening gloom,

  Within this narrow cell reclines her clay,

  The king of terrors seiz'd her as his prey,

  Oh! could that king of terrors pity feel,
    Or Heaven reverse the dread decree of fate,
  Not here the mourner would his grief reveal,
    Not here the muse her virtues would relate.

  But wherefore weep! her matchless spirit soars,
    Beyond where aplendid shines the orb of day.
  And weeping angels lead her to those bowers,
    Where endless pleasures virtuous deeds repay.

5.

  And shall presumptuous mortals Heaven arraign!
    And madly God-like Providence accuse!
  Ah! no far fly from me attempts so vain,
    I'll ne'er submission to my God refuse.

6.

  Yet is remembrance of those virtues dear,
    Yet fresh the memory of that beauteous face;
  Still they call forth my warm affection's tear.
    Such sorrow brings me honour, not disgrace.[4]

    When love, and hope, lay _both_ o'erthrown,
  Yet still, my girl, _this_ bleeding breast,
    Throbb'd with deep sorrow, as _thine own_.

  But when our cheeks with anguish glow'd,
    When _thy_ sweet lips where join'd to mine;
  The tears that from _my_ eye-lids flow'd,
    Were lost in those which fell from _thine_.

  Thou could'st not feel my burning cheek,
    _Thy_ gushing tears had quench'd its flame,
  And as thy tongue essay'd to speak,
    In _sighs alone_ it breath'd my name.

  And yet, my girl, we weep in vain,

TO CAROLINE.

  You say you love, and yet your eye
    No symptom of that love conveys,
  You say you love, yet know not why,
    Your cheek no sign of love betrays.

2.

  Ah! did that breast with ardour glow,
  With me alone it joy could know,
  Or feel with me the listless woe,
    Which racks my heart when far from thee.

3.

  Whene'er we meet my blushes rise,
    And mantle through my purpled cheek,
  But yet no blush to mine replies,
    Nor e'en your eyes your love bespeak.

4.

  Your voice alone declares your flame,
  And though so sweet it breaths my name;
  Our passions still are not the same,
    Alas! you cannot love like me.

5.

  For e'en your lip seems steep'd in snow,
    And though so oft it meets my kiss,
  It burns with no responsive glow,
    Nor melts like mine in dewy bliss.

6.

  Ah! what are words to love like mine,
  Though uttered by a voice like thine,
  I still in murmurs must repine,
    And think that love can ne'er be true.

7.

  Which meets me with no joyous sign,
    Without a sigh which bids adieu;
  How different is my love from thine,
    How keen my grief when leaving you.

8.

  Your image fills my anxious breast,
  Till day declines adown the West,
  And when, at night, I sink to rest,
    In dreams your fancied form I view.

9.

  'Tis then your breast, no longer cold,
    With equal ardour seems to burn,
  While close your arms around me fold,
    Your lips my kiss with warmth return.

10.

  Ah! would these joyous moments last;
  Vain HOPE! the gay delusions past,
  That voice!--ah! no, 'tis but the blast,
    Which echoes through the neighbouring grove.

11.

  But when _awake_, your lips I seek,
    And clasp enraptur'd all your charms,
  So chill's the pressure of your cheek,
    I fold a statue in my arms.

12.

  If thus, when to my heart embrac'd,
  No pleasure in your eyes is trac'd,
  You may be prudent, fair, and chaste,
    But ah! my girl, you _do not love_.

TO MARIA ----


  Since now the hour is come at last,
    When you must quit your anxious lover,
  Since now, our dream of bliss is past,
    One pang, my girl, and all is over.

  Alas! that pang will be severe,
    Which bids us part, to meet no more;
  Which tears me far from _one_ so dear,
    _Departing_ for a distant shore.

  Well! we have pass'd some happy hours,
    And joy will mingle with our tears;
  When thinking on these ancient towers,
    The shelter of our infant years.

  Where from this gothic casement's height,
    We view'd the lake, the park, the dell,
  And still though tears obstruct our sight,
    We lingering look a last farewell.--

  O'er fields, through which we us'd to run,
    And spend the hours in childish play,
  O'er shades where, when our race was done,
    Reposing on my breast you lay,

  Whilst I, admiring, too remiss,
    Forgot to scare the hovering flies,
  Yet envied every fly the kiss,
    It dar'd to give your slumbering eyes.

  See still the little painted _bark_,
    In which I row'd you o'er the lake;
  See there, high waving o'er the park,
    The _elm_, I clamber'd for your sake.

  These times are past, our joys are gone,
    You leave me, leave this happy vale;
  These scenes, I must retrace alone,
    Without thee, what will they avail.

  Who can conceive, who has not prov'd,
    The anguish of a last embrace?
  When torn from all you fondly lov'd,
    You bid a long adieu to peace.

  _This_ is the deepest of our woes,
    For _this_, these tears our cheeks bedew,
  This is of love the final close,
    Oh GOD! the fondest, _last_ adieu!

    Since first Hesione thy bride,
  When plac'd aloft in godlike state,
    The blushing beauty by thy side.
  Thou sat'st, while reverend Ocean smil'd,

  Nor yet thy doom was fix'd nor Jove relentless frown'd.

  Away, away,--your flattering arts,
  May now betray some simpler hearts;
  And _you_ will _smile_ at their believing,
  And _they_ shall _weep_ at your deceiving.

_ANSWER TO THE ABOVE, ADDRESS'D TO MISS ----_.

  Dear simple girl those flattering arts,
  (From which you'd guard frail female hearts,)
  Exist but in imagination,
  Mere phantoms of your own creation;
  For he who sees that witching grace,
  That perfect form, that lovely face;
  With eyes admiring, oh! believe me,
  He never wishes to deceive thee;
  Once let you at your mirror glance,
  You'll there descry that elegance,
  Which from our sex demands such praises,
  But envy in the other raises.--
  Then he who tells you of your beauty,
  Believe me only does his duty;
  Ah! fly not from the candid youth,
  It is not flattery, but truth.

ON A CHANGE OF MASTERS, AT A GREAT PUBLIC SCHOOL.


  Where are those honours? IDA, once your own,
  When Probus fill'd your magisterial throne;
  As ancient Rome fast falling to disgrace,
  Hail'd a Barbarian in her Cæsar's place;
  So you degenerate share as hard a fate,
  And seat _Pomposus_, where your _Probus_ sate.
  Of narrow brain, but of a narrower soul,
  Pomposus, holds you in his harsh controul;
  Pomposus, by no social virtue sway'd,
  With florid jargon, and with vain parade;
  With noisy nonsense, and new fangled rules,
  (Such as were ne'er before beheld in schools,)
  Mistaking _pedantry_, for _learning's_ laws,
  He governs, sanctioned but by self applause.
  With him, the same dire fate attending Rome,
  Ill-fated IDA! soon must stamp your doom;
  Like her o'erthrown, forever lost to fame,
  No trace of science left you, but the name.

EPITAPH ON A BELOVED FRIEND.


  Oh Boy! forever lov'd, for ever dear,
  What fruitless tears have wash'd thy honour'd bier;
  What sighs re-echoed to thy parting breath,
  Whilst thou wert struggling in the pangs of death.
  Could tears have turn'd the tyrant in his course,
  Could sighs have check'd his dart's relentless force;
  Could youth and virtue claim a short delay,
  Or beauty charm the spectre from his prey.
  Thou still had'st liv'd, to bless my aching sight,
  Thy comrade's honour, and thy friend's delight:
  Though low thy lot, since in a cottage born,
  No titles did thy humble name adorn,
  To me, far dearer, was thy artless love,
  Than all the joys, wealth, fame, and friends could prove.
  For thee alone I liv'd, or wish'd to live,
  (Oh God! if impious, this rash word forgive)
  Heart broken now, I wait an equal doom,
  Content to join thee in thy turf-clad tomb;
  Where this frail form compos'd in endless rest,
  I'll make my last, cold, pillow on thy breast;
  That breast where oft in life, I've laid my head,
  Will yet receive me mouldering with the dead;
  This life resign'd without one parting sigh,
  Together in one bed of earth we'll lie!
  Together share the fate to mortals given,
  Together mix our dust, and hope for Heaven.

TO MARY.


  Rack'd by the flames of jealous rage,
    By all her torments deeply curst,
    Of hell-born passions far the worst,
  What hope my pangs can now assuage?

2.

  I tore me from thy circling arms,
    To madness fir'd by doubts and fears,
    Heedless of thy suspicious tears,
  Nor feeling for thy feign'd alarms.

3.

  Resigning every thought of bliss,
    Forever, from your love I go,
    Reckless of all the tears that flow,
  Disdaining thy polluted kiss.

4.

  No more that bosom heaves for me,
    On it another seeks repose,
    Another riot's on its snows,
  Our bonds are broken, both are free.

5.

  No more with mutual love we burn,
    No more the genial couch we bless,
    Dissolving in the fond caress;
  Our love o'erthrown will ne'er return.

6.

  Though love than ours could ne'er be truer,
    Yet flames too fierce themselves destroy,
    Embraces oft repeated cloy,
  _Ours_ came too _frequent_, to endure.

7.

  You quickly sought a second lover,
    And I too proud to share a heart,
    Where once I held the _whole_, not _part_,
  Another mistress must discover.

8.

  Though not the _first_ one, who hast blest me,
    Yet I will own, you was the dearest,
    The one, unto my bosom nearest;
  So I conceiv'd, when I possest thee.

9.

  Even now I cannot well forget thee,
    And though no more in folds of pleasure,
    Kiss follows kiss in countless measure,
  I hope _you_ sometimes will regret me.

10.

  And smile to think how oft were done,
    What prudes declare a sin to act is,
    And never but in darkness practice,
  Fearing to trust the tell-tale sun.

11.

  And wisely therefore night prefer,
    Whose dusky mantle veils their fears,
    Of _this_, and _that_, of eyes and ears,
  Affording shades to those that err.

12.

  Now, by my foul, 'tis most delight
    To view each other panting, dying.
    In love's _extatic posture_ lying,
  Grateful to _feeling_, as to _sight_.

13.

  And had the glaring God of Day,
    (As formerly of Mars and Venus)
    Divulg'd the joys which pass'd between us,
  Regardless of his _peeping_ ray.

14.

  Of love admiring such a _sample_,
    The Gods and Goddesses descending,
    Had never fancied us offending,
  But _wisely_ followed _our example_.

  When to their airy hall, my father's voice,
  Shall call my spirit, joyful in their choice,
  When pois'd upon the gale, my form shall ride,
  Or dark in mist, descend the mountain's side;
  Oh! may my shade behold no sculptur'd urns,
  To mark the spot, where earth to earth returns.
  No lengthen'd scroll of virtue, and renown,
  My _epitaph_, shall be my name alone;
  If _that_ with honour fails to crown my clay,
  Oh! may no other fame my deeds repay;
  _That_, only _that_, shall single out the shot,
  By _that_ remember'd, or fore'er forgot.--

TO ----


1.

  Oh! when shall the grave hide forever my sorrow?
    Oh! when shall my soul wing her flight from this clay?
  The present is hell! and the coming to-morrow,
    But brings with new torture, the curse of to-day.

2.

  From my eye flows no tear, from my lips fall no curses,
    I blast not the fiends, who have hurl'd me from bliss,
  For poor is the soul which bewailing rehearses,
    Its querulous grief, when in anguish like this--

3.

  Was my eye, 'stead of tears, with red fury flakes bright'ning.
    Would my lips breathe a flame, which no stream could assuage,
  On our foes should my glance launch in vengeance its lightning,
    With transport my tongue give a loose to its rage.

4.

  But now tears and curses alike unavailing,
    Would add to the souls of our tyrants delight;
  Could they view us, our sad separation bewailing,
    Their merciless hearts would rejoice at the sight.

5.

  Yet still though we bend with a feign'd resignation,
    Life beams not for us with one ray that can cheer,
  Love and hope upon earth bring no more consolation,
    In the grave is our hope, for in life is our fear.

6.

  Oh! when, my ador'd, in the tomb will they place me,
    Since in life, love and friendship, for ever are fled,
  If again in the mansion of death I embrace thee,
    Perhaps they will leave unmolested--the dead.

1805.

       *       *       *       *       *



1.

  When I hear you express an affection so warm,
    Ne'er think, my belov'd, that I do not believe,
  For your lip, would the soul of suspicion disarm,
    And your eye beams a ray, which can never deceive.

2.

  Yet still, this fond bosom regrets whilst adoring,
    That love like the leaf, must fall into the sear,
  That age will come on, when remembrance deploring,
    Contemplates the scenes of her youth, with a tear.

3.

  That the time must arrive, when no longer retaining
    Their auburn, these locks must wave thin to the breeze.
  When a few silver hairs of those tresses remaining,
    Prove nature a prey to decay, and disease.

4.

  'Tis this, my belov'd, which spreads gloom o'er my features
    Tho' I ne'er shall presume to arraign the decree;
  Which God has proclaim'd as the fate of his creatures,
    In the death which one day will deprive me of thee.

5.

  No jargon of priests o'er our union was mutter'd,
    To rivet the fetters of husband and wife;
  By our lips, by our hearts, were our vows alone utter'd,
    To perform them, in full, would ask more than a life.

6.

  But as death my belov'd, soon or late, shall o'ertake us,
    And our breasts which alive with such sympathy glow,
  Will sleep in the grave, till the blast shall awake us,
    When calling the dead, in earth's bosom laid low.

7.

  Oh! then let us drain, while we may, draughts of pleasure,
    Which from passion like ours will unceasingly flow;
  Let us pass round the cup of love's bliss in full measure,
    And quaff the contents as our nectar below.

ON A DISTANT VIEW OF THE VILLAGE AND SCHOOL OF HARROW ON THE HILL.
1806.


  Ye scenes of my childhood, whose lov'd recollection,
    Embitters the present, compar'd with the past;
  Where science first dawn'd on the powers of reflection,
    And friendships were form'd, too romantic to last.

2.

  Where fancy yet joys, to retrace the resemblance,
    Of comrades in friendship, and mischief allied;
  How welcome once more your ne'er fading remembrance,
    Which rests in the bosom, though hope is deny'd.

3.

  Again I revisit the hills where we sported,
    The streams where we swam, and the fields where we fought;
  The school where loud warn'd by the bell we resorted,
    To pore o'er the precepts by Pedagogues taught.

4.

  Again I behold where for hours I have ponder'd,
    As reclining at eve on yon tombstone I lay;
  Or round the steep brow of the churchyard I wander'd,
    To catch the last gleam of the sun's setting ray.

5.

  I once more view the room with spectators surrounded,
    Where as Zanga I trod on Alonzo o'erthrown;
  While to swell my young pride such applauses resounded,
    I fancied that MOSSOP[5] himself was outshone.

6.

  Or as Lear I pour'd for the deep imprecation,
    By my daughters of kingdom and reason depriv'd:
  Till fir'd by loud plaudits, and self adulation,
    I consider'd myself as a _Garrick_ reviv'd.

7.

  Ye dreams of my boyhood how much I regret you,
    As your memory beams through this agoniz'd breast,
  Thus sad and deserted, I ne'er can forget you,
    Though this heart throbs to bursting by anguish possest.

8.

  I thought this poor brain fever'd even to madness,
    Of tears as of reason forever was drain'd,
  But the drops which now flow down _this_ bosom of sadness,
    Convince me, the springs have some moisture retain'd.

9.

  Sweet scenes of my childhood! your blest recollection,
    Has wrung from these eye-lids to weeping long dead,
  In torrents, the tears of my warmest affection,
    The last and the fondest, I ever shall shed.

THOUGHTS SUGGESTED BY A COLLEGE EXAMINATION.


  High in the midst surrounded by his peers,
  M--ns--l his ample front sublime uprears;
  Plac'd on his chair of state, he seems a God,
  While Sophs and Freshmen, tremble at his nod.
  Whilst all around sit wrapt in speechless gloom,
  _His_ voice in thunder shakes the sounding dome;
  Denouncing dire reproach, to luckless fools,
  Unskill'd to plod in mathematic rules.

  Happy the youth! in Euclid's axioms tried,
  Though little vers'd in any art beside;
  Who with scarce sense to pen an _English_ letter,
  Yet with precision, scans an _attic metre_.

  What! though he knows not how his fathers bled,
  When civil discord pil'd the fields with dead,
  When Edward bade his conquering bands advance,
  Or Henry trampled on the crest of France;
  Though marvelling at the name of _Magna Charta_,
  Yet, well he recollects the _laws of Sparta_.
  Can tell what edicts sage _Lycurgus_ made,
  Whilst _Blackstone's_ on the _shelf neglected_ laid;
  Of _Grecian dramas_ vaunts the deathless fame,
  Of _Avon's bard_, remembering scarce the name.

  Such is the youth, whose scientific pate,
  Class honours, medals, fellowships await;
  Or even perhaps the _declamation_ prize,
  If to such glorious height, he lifts his eyes.
  But lo! no _common_ orator can hope
  The envied silver cup within his scope;
  Not that our _heads_ much eloquence require,
  The ATHENIAN's glowing style, or TULLY's fire.
  The _manner_ of the speech is nothing, since
  We do not try by _speaking_ to _convince_;
  Be other _orators_ of pleasing _proud_,
  We speak to _please_ ourselves, not _move_ the crowd.
  Our gravity prefers the _muttering_ tone,
  A proper mixture of the _squeak and groan_;
  No borrow'd _grace_ of _action_, must be seen,
  The slightest motion would displease the _dean_.
  Whilst every staring graduate would prate,
  Against what, _he_ could never imitate.

  The man, who hopes t' obtain the promis'd cup,
  Must in one _posture_ stand, and _ne'er look up_,
  Nor _stop_, but rattle over _every_ word,
  No matter _what_, so it can _not_ be heard;
  Thus let him hurry on, nor think to rest,
  Who speaks the _fastest_, 's sure to speak the _best_;
  Who utters most within the shortest space,
  May safely hope to win the _wordy race_.

  The sons of _Science these_, who thus repaid,
  Linger in ease, in Granta's sluggish shade;
  Where on Cam's sedgy banks supine they lie,
  Unknown, unhonour'd live, unwept for, die.
  Dull as the pictures, which adorn their halls,
  They think all learning fix'd within their walls:
  In manners rude, in foolish forms precise,
  All modern arts, affecting to despise.
  Yet prizing _Bentley's[6] Brunck's[6]_ or _Porson's_[7] note,
  More than the _verse, on which the critic wrote_;
  With eager haste, they court the tool of power,
  (Whether 'tis PITT or PETTY rules the hour:)
  To _him_, with suppliant smiles they bend the head,
  Whilst mitres, prebends, to their eyes are spread.
  But should a storm o'erwhelm him with disgrace,
  They'd fly to seek the next, who fill'd his place;
  _Such_ are the men who learning's treasures guard,
  _Such_ is their _practice_, such is their _reward_;
  This _much_ at least we may presume to say,
  Th' _reward's_ scarce equal, to the _price_ they _pay_.

ON THE DEATH OF MR. FOX, THE FOLLOWING ILLIBERAL IMPROMPTU APPEARED IN
THE MORNING POST.


  "Our Nation's foes, lament on _Fox's_ death,
  "But bless the hour, when PITT resign'd his breath;
  "These feelings wide, let Sense and Truth unclue,
  "We give the palm, where Justice points its due."

_To which the Author of these Pieces, sent the subjoined Reply, for
Insertion in the_ MORNING CHRONICLE.--

  Oh! factious viper! whose envenom'd tooth,
  Would mangle still the dead, in spite of truth,
  What though our "nation's foes" lament the fate,
  With generous feeling, of the good and great;
  Shall therefore dastard tongues assail the name
  Of him whose virtues claim eternal fame?
  When PITT expired in plenitude of power,
  Though ill success obscur'd his dying hour,
  Pity her dewy wings before him spread,
  For noble spirits "war not with the dead;"
  His friends in tears, a last sad requiem gave,
  And all his errors slumber'd in the grave.
  He died an Atlas, bending 'neath the weight,
  Of cares oppressing our unhappy state;
  But lo! another Hercules appear'd,
  Who for a time, the ruined fabric rear'd;
  He too is dead! who still our England propp'd,
  With him our fast reviving hopes have dropp'd;
  Not one great people only raise his urn,
  All Europe's far extended regions mourn.
  "These feelings wide, let Sense and Truth unclue,
  "And give the palm where Justice points it due;"
  But let not canker'd calumny assail,
  And round our statesman wind her gloomy veil.
  Fox! o'er whose corse a mourning world must weep,
  Whose dear remains in honoured marble sleep;
  For whom at last, even hostile nations groan,
  And friends and foes alike his talents own;
  Fox! shall in Britain's future annals shine,
  Nor e'en to _Pitt_, the patriot's _palm_ resign;
  Which Envy, wearing Candour's sacred mask,
  For PITT, and PITT alone, would dare to ask.

TO A LADY, WHO PRESENTED THE AUTHOR A LOCK OF HAIR, BRAIDED WITH HIS
OWN, AND APPOINTED A NIGHT IN DECEMBER, TO MEET HIM IN THE GARDEN.


  These locks which fondly thus entwine,
  In firmer chains our hearts confine;
  Than all th' unmeaning protestations,
  Which swell with nonsense, love orations.
  Our love is fix'd, I think we've prov'd it,
  Nor time, nor place, nor art, have mov'd it;
  Then wherefore should we sigh, and whine,
  With groundless jealousy repine.
  With silly whims, and fancies frantic,
  Merely to make our love romantic.
  Why should you weep like _Lydia Languish_,
  And fret with self-created anguish.
  Or doom the lover you have chosen,
  On winter nights, to sigh half frozen:
  In leafless shades, to sue for pardon,
  Only because the scene's a garden.
  For gardens seem by one consent
  (Since SHAKESPEARE set the precedent;)
  (Since Juliet first declar'd her passion)
  To form the place of assignation.
  Oh! would some modern muse inspire,
  And seat her by a _sea-coal_ fire,
  Or had the bard at Christmas written,
  And laid the scene of love in Britain;
  He surely in commiseration,
  Had chang'd the place of declaration.
  In Italy I've no objection,
  Warm nights are proper for reflection;
  But here, our climate is so rigid,
  That love itself, is rather frigid;
  Think on our chilly situation,
  And curb this rage for imitation.
  Then let us meet, as oft we've done,
  Beneath the influence of the sun;
  Or, if at midnight I must meet you,
  Oh! let me in your chamber greet you;
  _There_ we can love for hours together,
  Much better in such snowy weather,
  Than plac'd in all th' Arcadian groves,
  That ever witness'd rural loves;
  _There_ if my passion fail to please,
  Next night I'll be content to freeze;
  No more I'll give a loose to laughter,
  But curse my fate, forever after.

TO A BEAUTIFUL QUAKER.


  Sweet girl! though only once we met,
  That meeting I shall ne'er forget;
  And though we ne'er may meet again,
  Remembrance will thy form retain;
  I would not say, "I love" but still
  My senses struggle with my will;
  In vain to drive thee from my breast,
  My thoughts are more and more represt,
  In vain, I check the rising sighs,
  Another to the last replies;
  Perhaps this is not love, but yet
  Our meeting I can ne'er forget.

  What though we never silence broke,
  Our eyes a sweeter language spoke;
  The tongue in flattering falsehood deals,
  And tells a tale, it never feels;
  Deceit, the guilty lips impart,
  And hush the mandates of the heart,
  But soul's interpreters, the eyes
  Spurn such restraint, and scorn disguise.
  As thus our glances oft convers'd,
  And all our bosoms felt, rehears'd,
  No _spirit_ from within reprov'd us,
  Say rather, "'twas the _spirit mov'd us_."
  Though what they utter'd, I repress,
  Yet, I conceive, thou'lt partly guess;
  For, as on thee, my memory ponders,
  Perchance, to me thine also wanders;
  This for myself, at least I'll say,
  Thy form appears through night, through day,
  Awake, with it my fancy teems,
  In sleep, it smiles in fleeting dreams;
  The vision charms the hours away,
  And bids me curse Aurora's ray;
  For breaking slumbers of delight,
  Which make me wish for endless night.
  Since, oh! whate'er my future fate,
  Shall joy or woe my steps await;
  Tempted by love, by storms beset,
  Thine image, I can ne'er forget.

  Alas! again no more we meet,
  No more our former looks repeat;
  Then let me breathe this parting prayer,
  The dictate of my bosom's care:
  "May Heaven so guard my lovely quaker,
  "That anguish never can o'ertake her;
  "That peace and virtue ne'er forsake her,
  "But bliss be aye, her heart's partaker:
  "No jealous passion shall invade,
  "No envy that pure breast pervade;"
  For he that revels in such charms,
  Can never seek another's arms;
  "Oh! may the happy mortal fated,
  "To be by dearest ties related;
  "For _her_ each hour _new joy_ discover,
  "And lose the husband in the lover.
  "May that fair bosom never know
  "What 'tis to feel the restless woe;

TO JULIA!


  Julia! since far from you I've rang'd,
    Our souls with fond affection glow not;
  You say 'tis I, _not you_ have chang'd,
    I'd tell you why,--but yet I know not.

2.

  Your polish'd brow, no cares have crost,
    And Julia! we are not much older,
  Since trembling first my heart I lost,
    Or told my love with hope, grown bolder.

3.

  Sixteen was then our utmost age,
    Two years have lingering pass'd away, love!
  And now new thoughts our minds engage,
    At least, _I_ feel disposed to stray, love!

4.

  'Tis _I_, that am alone to blame,
    _I_, that am guilty of love's treason;
  Since your sweet breast, is still the same,
    Caprice must be my only reason.

5.

  I do not, love, suspect your truth,
    With jealous doubt my bosom heaves not,
  Warm was the passion of my youth,
    One trace of dark deceit it leaves not.

6.

  No, no, my flame was not pretended,
    For oh! I lov'd you most sincerely,
  And though our dream at last is ended,
    My bosom still esteems you dearly.

7.

  No more we meet in yonder bowers,
    Perhaps my soul's too prone to roving,
  But older, firmer _hearts_ than ours,
    Have found monotony in loving.

8.

  Your cheeks soft bloom is unimpair'd,
    Your beauties still are daily bright'ning,
  Your eye for conquest comes prepar'd,
    The forge of love's resistless lightning.

9.

  Arm'd thus to make their bosoms bleed,
    Many will throng to sigh like me, love,
  More constant they may prove indeed,
    Fonder alas! they ne'er can be, love!

       *       *       *       *       *


TO WOMAN.


  Surely experience might have told me,
  That all must love thee, who behold thee;
  Surely experience might have taught,
  A woman's promises are naught,
  But plac'd in all thy charms before me,
  All I forget, but to _adore_ thee.
  Oh memory! thou choicest blessing,
  When join'd with hope, when still possessing;
  Thou whisperest, as our hearts are beating,
  "What oft we've done, we're still repeating."
  But how much curst by every lover,
  When hope is fled, and passion's over.
  Woman that fair and fond deceiver,
  How prompt are striplings to believe her,
  How throbs the pulse, when first we view,
  The eye that rolls in glossy blue;
  Or sparkles black, or mildly throws,
  A beam from under hazel brows;
  How quick we credit every oath,
  And hear her plight the willing troth;
  Fondly we hope 'twill last for aye,
  When lo! she changes in a day,
  The Record will forever stand,
  "That woman's vows, are writ in sand."

AN OCCASIONAL PROLOGUE DELIVERED BY THE AUTHOR, PREVIOUS TO THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE, AT A PRIVATE THEATRE.


  Since the refinement of this polish'd age,
  Has swept immoral raillery from the stage;
  Since taste has now expung'd licentious wit,
  Which stamp'd disgrace on all an author writ;
  Since now to please with purer scenes we seek,
  Nor dare to call the blush from beauty's cheek;
  Oh! let the modest muse some pity claim,
  And meet indulgence--though she find not fame.
  But not for _her_ alone, we wish respect,
  _Others_ appear more conscious of defect;
  To night, no _Veteran Roscii_ you behold,
  In all the arts of scenic action old;
  No COOKE, no KEMBLE, can salute you here,
  No SIDDONS draw the sympathetic tear,
  To night, you thong to witness the debut,
  Of embryo actors to the drama new;
  Here then, our almost unfledg'd wings we try,
  Clip not our _pinions_, ere the _birds can fly_;
  Failing in this our first attempt to soar,
  Drooping, alas, we fall to rise no more.
  Not one poor trembler only, fear betrays,
  Who hopes, yet almost dreads to meet your praise;
  But all our Dramatis Personæ wait,
  In fond suspense, this crisis of their fate;
  No venal views our progress can retard,
  Your generous plaudits are our sole reward;
  For them each _Hero_ all his power displays,
  Each timid _Heroine_ shrinks before your gaze:
  Surely these last will some protection find,
  None to the softer sex can prove unkind;
  Whilst youth and beauty form the female shield,
  The sternest critic to the fair must yield.
  But should our feeble efforts nought avail,
  Should, _after all_, our best endeavours fail;
  Still let some mercy in your bosoms live,
  And if you can't applaud, at least _forgive_.

       *       *       *       *       *


TO MISS E.P.


1.

  Eliza! what fools are the Mussulman sect,
    Who to woman deny the soul's future existence,
  Could they see thee, Eliza! they'd own their defect,
    And this doctrine would meet with a general resistance.

2.

  Had their Prophet possess'd but an atom of sense,
    He ne'er would have _woman_ from Paradise driven,
  But instead of his _Houris_ a flimsy pretence,
    With _woman alone_, he had peopled his Heaven.

3.

  But still to increase your calamities more,
    Not content with depriving your bodies of spirit,
  He allots but _one husband_ to share amongst four,
    With _souls_ you'd dispense--but this last who could bear it.

4.

  His religion to please neither _party_ is made,
    On _husbands_ 'tis _hard_, to the wives most uncivil;
  But I can't contradict what so oft has been said,
    "Though women are angels, yet wedlock's the devil."

5.

  This terrible truth, even Scripture has told,
    Ye Benedicks! hear me, and listen with rapture;
  If a glimpse of redemption you wish to behold,
    Of St. MATT.--read the second and twentieth chapter.

6.

  'Tis surely enough upon earth to be vex'd,
    With wives who eternal confusion are spreading;
  "But in Heaven" (so runs the Evangelist's Text,)
    "We neither have giving in marriage, or wedding."

7.

  From this we suppose, (as indeed well we may,)
    That should Saints after death, with their spouses put up more,
  And wives, as in life, aim at absolute sway,
    All Heaven would ring with the conjugal uproar.

8.

  Distraction and discord would follow in course,
    Nor MATTHEW, nor MARK, nor St. PAUL, can deny it,
  The only expedient is general divorce,
    To prevent universal disturbance and riot.

9.

  But though husband and wife, shall at length be disjoin'd
    Yet woman and man ne'er were meant to dissever,
  Our chains once dissolv'd, and our hearts unconfin'd,
    We'll love without bonds, but we'll love you forever.

10.

  Though souls are denied you by fools and by rakes,
    Should you own it yourselves, I would even then doubt you,
  Your nature so much of _celestial_ partakes,
    The Garden of Eden would wither without you.

THE TEAR.


1.

    When Friendship or Love,
    Our sympathies move,
  When Truth in a glance should appear,
    The lips may beguile,
    With a dimple or smile,
  But the test of affection's a _tear_.

2.

    Too oft is a smile,
    But the hypocrite's wile,
  To mask detestation, or fear,
    Give me the soft sigh,
    Whilst the soul telling eye
  Is dimm'd, for a time, with a _tear_.

3.

    Mild charity's glow,
    To us mortals below,
  Shows the soul from barbarity clear,
    Compassion will melt,
    Where this virtue is felt,
  And its dew is diffused in a _tear_.

4.

    The man doom'd to sail,
    With the blast of the gale,
  Through billows Atlantic to steer,
    As he bends o'er the wave,
    Which may soon be his grave,
  The green sparkles bright with a _tear_.

5.

    The soldier braves death,
    For a fanciful wreath,
  In Glory's romantic career;
    But he raises the foe,
    When in battle laid low,
  And bathes every wound with a _tear_.

6.

    When with high bounding pride,
    He returns to his bride,
  Renouncing the gore crimson'd spear;
    All his toils are repaid,
    When embracing the maid,
  From her eyelid he kisses the tear.

7.

    Sweet scene of my youth,
    Seat of Friendship and Truth,
  Where Love chac'd each fast-fleeting year,
    Loth to leave thee I mourn'd,
    For a last look I turn'd,
  But thy spire was scarce seen through a _tear_.

8.

    Though my vows I can pour,
    To my Mary no more,
  My Mary to love once so _dear_,
    In the shade of her bower,
    I remember the hour,
  She rewarded those vows with a _tear_.

9.

    By another possest,
    May she live ever blest,
  Her name still my heart must revere,
    With a sigh I resign,
    What I once thought was mine,
  And forgive her deceit with a _tear_.

10.

    Ye friends of my heart,
    Ere from you I depart,
  This hope to my breast is most near,
    If again we shall meet,
    In this rural retreat,
  May we _meet_, as we _part_, with a _tear_.

11.

    When my soul wings her flight,
    To the regions of night,
  And my body shall sleep on its bier;
    As ye pass by the tomb,
    Where my ashes consume,
  Oh! moisten their dust with a _tear_.

12.

    May no marble bestow,
    The splendour of woe,
  Which the children of Vanity rear,
    No fiction of fame,
    Shall blazon my name,
  All I ask, all I wish, is a _tear_.

REPLY TO SOME VERSES OF J.M.B. PIGOT, ESQ. ON THE CRUELTY OF HIS
MISTRESS.


1.

    Why PIGOT, complain,
    Of this damsel's disdain,
  Why thus in despair, do you fret?
    For months you may try,
    But believe me a _sigh_,
  Will never obtain a coquette.

2.

    Would you teach her to love,
    For a time seem to rove,
  At first she may _frown_ in a _pet_;
    But leave her awhile,
    She shortly will smile,
  And then you may _kiss_ your _coquette_.

3.

    For such are the airs,
    Of these fanciful fairs,
  They think all our _homage_ a _debt_;
    But a partial neglect,
    Soon takes an effect,
  And humbles the proudest _coquette_.

4.

    Dissemble your pain,
    And lengthen your chain,
  Nor seem her _hauteur_ to _regret_,
    If again you shall sigh,
    She no more will deny,
  That _yours_ is the rosy _coquette_.

5.

    But if from false pride,
    Your pangs she deride,
  This whimsical virgin forget;
    Some _other_ admire,
    Who will _melt_ with your _fire_,
  And laugh at the _little_ coquette.

6.

    For _me_, I adore,
    Some _twenty_ or more,
  And love them most dearly, but yet,
    Though my heart they enthral,
    I'd abandon them all,
  Did they act like your blooming _coquette_.

7.

    No longer repine,
    But form this design,
  And break through her slight woven net;
    Away with despair,
    No longer forbear,
  To fly from the captious coquette.

8.

    Then quit her, my friend!
    Your bosom defend,
  Ere quite with her snares you're beset;
    Lest your deep wounded heart
    When incens'd by the smart,
  Should lead you to _curse_ the coquette.

GRANTA, A MEDLEY.


  Oh! could LE SAGE's[8] demon's gift,
    Be realized at my desire,
  This night my trembling form he'd lift,
    And place it on St. Mary's spire.

2.

  Then would unroof'd old Granta's Halls
    Pedantic inmates full display,
  _Fellows_ who dream on _lawn_, or _stalls_,
    The price of hireling votes to pay.

3.

  Then would I view each rival Wight,
    PETTY and PALMERSTON survey,
  Who canvass now with all their might,
    Against the next elective day.

4.

  One on his power and place depends,
    The other on the Lord knows what,
  Each to some eloquence pretends,
    But neither will convince by _that_.

5.

  The first indeed may not demur,
    Fellows are sage reflecting men,
  And know preferment can occur,
    But very seldom, _now_ and _then_.

6.

  They know the Chancellor has got,
    Some pretty livings in disposal,
  Each hopes that _one_ may be his _lot_,
    And therefore smiles at his proposal.

7.

  Now from corruption's shameless scene,
    I'll turn mine eye, as night grows later,
  And view unheeded, and unseen,
    The studious sons of Alma Mater.

8.

  There in apartments small and damp,
    The candidate for college prizes,
  Sits poring by the midnight lamp,
    Goes late to bed and early rises.

9.

  He surely well deserves to gain them,
    And all the honours of His college,
  Who striving hardly to obtain them,
    Thus seeks unprofitable knowledge.

10.

  Who sacrifices hours of rest,
    To scan precisely metres attic,
  And agitates his anxious breast,
    In solving problems mathematic.

11.

  Who reads false quantities in Sele,[9]
    Or puzzles o'er the deep triangle,
  And robs himself of many a meal,
    In _barbarous latin_[10] doom'd to wrangle.

12.

  Renouncing every pleasing page,
    From authors of historic use,
  Preferring to the lettered sage,
    The square of the hypothenuse.[11]

13.

  But harmless are these occupations,
    Which hurt none but the hapless student;
  Compared with other recreations,
    Which bring together the imprudent.

14.

  Whose daring revels shock the sight,
    When vice and infamy combine,
  When drunkenness and dice unite,
    And every sense is steep'd in wine.

15.

  Not so the methodistic crew,
    Who plans of reformation lay,
  In humble attitude they sue,
    And for the sins of others pray.

16.

  Forgetting that their pride of spirit,
    And exultation in their trial;
  Detracts most largely from the merit,
    Of all their boasted self-denial.

17.

  'Tis morn,--from these I turn my sight,
    What scene is this which meets the eye,
  As numerous crowd array'd in white,[12]
    Across the green in numbers fly.

18.

  Loud rings in air, the chapel bell,
    'Tis hush'd,--what sounds are these I hear,
  The organ's soft celestial swell,
    Rolls deeply on the listening ear.

19.

  To this is join'd the sacred song,
    The royal minstrel's hallowed strain,
  But _he_ who hears the _music_ long,
    Will _never_ wish to _hear again_.

20.

  Our choir would scarcely be excus'd,
    Even as a band of raw beginners,
  But mercy now must be refus'd,
    To such a set of croaking sinners.

21.

  If David when his toils were ended,
    Had heard these blockheads sing before him,
  To us his psalms had ne'er descended,
    In furious mood he would have tore 'em.

22.

  The luckless Israelites when taken,
    By some inhuman tyrant's order,
  Were ask'd to sing, by joy forsaken,
    On Babylonian river's border.

23.

  But had they sung in notes like these,
    Inspir'd by stratagem, or fear,
  They might have set their hearts at ease,
    The devil a soul had stay'd to hear.

24.

  _But if I write_ much longer now,
    The deuce a soul _will stay to read_,
  My pen is blunt, the ink is low,
    'Tis almost time to _stop, indeed_.

25.

  Therefore farewell, old GRANTA's spires,
    No more like _Cleofas_ I fly,
  No more thy theme my muse inspires,
    The reader's tired, and so am I.

_October_ 28, 1806.

TO THE SIGHING STREPHON.


    Your pardon my friend,
    If my rhymes did offend,
  Your pardon a thousand times o'er,
    From friendship I strove,
    Your pangs to remove,
  But I swear I will do so no more.

2.

    Since your _beautiful_ maid
    Your flame has repaid,
  No more I your folly regret;
    She's now most divine,
    And I bow at the shrine,
  Of this quickly reformed coquette.

3.

    But still I must own,
    I should never have known,
  From _your verses_ what else she deserv'd,
    Your pain seem'd so great,
    I pitied your fate,
  As your fair was so dev'lish reserv'd.

4.

    But since the chaste kiss,
    Of this magical Miss,
  Such wonderful transports produce,
    Since the "_world you forget,"
    "When your lips once have met_,"
  My Counsel will get but abuse.

5.

    You say "when I rove"
    "I know nothing of love,"
  'Tis true I am given to range,
    If I rightly remember,
    I've kiss'd a good number,
  But there's pleasure at least in a change.

6.

    I ne'er will advance,
    By the rules of romance,
  To humour a whimsical fair,
    Though a smile may delight,
    Yet a _frown_ wont _affright_,
  Or drive me to dreadful despair.

7.

    Whilst my blood is thus warm,
    I ne'er shall reform,
  To mix in the Platonist's school;
    Of this I am sure,
    Was my passion so pure,
  _My mistress_ must think me _a fool_.

8.

    Though the kisses are sweet,
    Which voluptuously meet,
  Of kissing I ne'er was so fond,
    As to make me forget,
    Though our lips oft have met,
  That still there was _something beyond_.

9.

    And if I should shun,
    Every _woman_ for _one_,
  Whose _image_ must fill my whole breast;
    Whom I must _prefer_,
    And _sigh_ but for _her_,
  What an _insult_ 'twould be to the _rest_!

10.

    Now, Strephon, good bye,
    I cannot deny,
  _Your passion_ appears most absurd,
    Such _love_ as you plead,
    Is _pure_ love indeed,
  For it _only_ consists in the _word_.

THE CORNELIAN.


  No specious splendour of this stone,
    Endears it to my memory ever,
  With lustre _only once_ it shone,
    But blushes modest as the giver.

2.

  Some who can sneer at friendship's ties,
    Have for my weakness oft reprov'd me,
  Yet still the simple gift I prize,
    For I am sure, the giver lov'd me.

3.

  He offered it with downcast look,
    As _fearful_ that I might refuse it,
  I told him when the gift I took,
    My _only fear_ should be to lose it.

4.

  This pledge attentively I view'd,
    And _sparkling_ as I held it near,
  Methought one drop the stone bedew'd,
    And ever since _I've lov'd a tear_.

5.

  Still to adorn his humble youth,
    Nor wealth nor birth their treasures yield,
  But he who seeks the flowers of truth,
    Must quit the garden for the field.

6.

  'Tis not the plant uprear'd in sloth,
    Which beauty shews, and sheds perfume,
  The flowers which yield the most of both,
    In nature's wild luxuriance bloom.

7.

  Had Fortune aided nature's care,
    For once forgetting to be blind,
  _His_ would have been an ample share,
    If well proportioned to his mind.

8.

  But had the Goddess clearly seen,
    His form had fixed her fickle breast,
  _Her_ countless hoards would _his_ have been,
    And none remain'd to give the rest.

TO A. ----

  Oh! did those eyes instead of fire,
    With bright, but mild affection shine,
  Though they might kindle less desire,
    Love, more than mortal, would be thine.

2.

  For thou art form'd so heavenly fair,
    _Howe'er_ those orbs _may_ wildly beam,
  We _must_ admire, but still despair,
    That fatal glance forbids esteem.

3.

  When nature stamp'd thy beauteous birth,
    So much perfection in thee shone,
  She fear'd, that too divine for earth,
    The skies might claim thee for their own.

4.

  Therefore to guard her dearest work,
    Lest angels might dispute the prize,
  She bade a secret lightning lurk,
    Within those once celestial eyes.

5.

  These might the boldest Sylph appal,
    When gleaming with meridian blaze,
  Thy beauty must enrapture all,
    But who can dare thine ardent gaze?

6.

  'Tis said that Berenice's hair,
    In stars adorns the vault of heaven,
  But they would ne'er permit _thee_ there,
    _Thou_ would'st so far outshine the seven.

7.

  For did those eyes as planets roll,
    Thy sister lights would scarce appear,
  E'en suns which systems now controul,
    Would twinkle dimly through their sphere.

AS THE AUTHOR WAS DISCHARGING HIS PISTOLS IN A GARDEN, TWO LADIES
PASSING NEAR THE SPOT, WERE ALARMED BY THE SOUND OF A BULLET HISSING
NEAR THEM. TO ONE OF WHOM THE FOLLOWING VERSES ON THE OCCASION, WERE
ADDRESSED THE NEXT MORNING.


1.

  Doubtless, sweet girl, the hissing lead,
    Wafting destruction near thy charms,
  And hurtling[13] o'er thy lovely head,
    Has fill'd that breast with fond alarms.

2.

  Surely some envious Demon's force,
    Vex'd to behold such beauty here,
  Impell'd the bullet's viewless course,
    Diverted from its first career.

3.

  Yes! in that nearly fatal hour,
    The ball obey'd some hell-born guide,
  But Heaven with interposing power,
    In pity turn'd the death aside.

4.

  Yet, as perchance one trembling tear,
    Upon that thrilling bosom fell,
  Which _I_, th' unconscious cause of fear,
    Extracted from its glistening cell;--

5.

  Say, what dire penance can atone?
    For such an outrage done to thee,
  Arraign'd before thy beauty's throne,
    What punishment wilt thou decree?

6.

  Might I perform the Judge's part,
    The sentence I should scarce deplore.
  It only would restore a heart,
    Which but belong'd to _thee_ before.

7.

  The least atonement, I can make,
    Is to become no longer free,
  Henceforth, I breathe, but for thy sake.
    Thou shall be _all in all_ to me.

8.

  But thou perhaps may'st now reject
    Such expiation of my guilt,
  Come then--some other mode elect?
    Let it be death--or what thou wilt.

9.

  Choose then relentless! and I swear,
    Nought shall thy dread decree prevent,
  Yet hold--one little word forbear!
    Let it be aught but _banishment_.

  _Hurtles_ through the darken'd air."

  Equal to Jove, that youth must be,
  _Greater_ than Jove he seems to me;
  Who free from Jealousy's alarms,
  Securely views thy matchless charms;
  That cheek which ever dimpling glows,
  That mouth from whence such music flows;
  To him alike are always known,
  Reserv'd for him, and him alone.
  Ah Lesbia! though 'tis death to me,
  I cannot choose, but look on thee;
  But at the sight, my senses fly,
  I needs must gaze, but gazing die;
  Whilst trembling with a thousand fears,
  Parch'd to the throat, my tongue adheres.
  My pulse beats quick, my breath heaves short,
  My limbs deny their slight support.
  Cold dews my pallid face o'erspread,
  With deadly languor droops my head.
  My ears with tingling echoes ring,
  And life itself is on the wing;
  My eyes refuse the cheering light,
  Their orbs are veil'd in starless night:
  Such pangs my nature sinks beneath,
  And feels a temporary death.--

  Ye Cupids droop each little head,
  Nor let your wings with joy be spread,
  My Lesbia's favourite bird is dead,
    Which dearer than her eyes she lov'd:
  For he was gentle and so true,
  Obedient to her call he flew,
  No fear, no wild alarm he knew,
    But lightly o'er her bosom mov'd.

  And softly fluttering here, and there,
  He never sought to cleave the air,
  But chirrup'd oft, and free from care,
    Tun'd to her ear his grateful strain.
  But now he's pass'd the gloomy bourn,
  From whence he never can return,
  His death, and Lesbia's grief I mourn,
    Who sighs alas! but sighs in vain.

  Oh curst be thou! devouring grave!
  Whose jaws eternal victims crave,
  From whom no earthly power can save,
    For thou hast ta'en the bird away.
  From thee, my Lesbia's eyes o'erflow,
  Her swollen cheeks with weeping glow,
  _Thou_ art the cause of all her woe,
    Receptacle of life's decay.

  A million scarce would quench desire,
  Still would I steep my lips in bliss,
  And dwell an age on every kiss;
  Nor then my soul should sated be,
  Still would I kiss, and cling to thee,
  Nought should my kiss from thine dissever.
  Still would we kiss, and kiss forever;
  E'en though the number did exceed,
  The yellow harvest's countless seed,
  To part would be a vain endeavour,
  Could I desist?--ah! never--never.

PREFACE

Two great collections of Byron's letters have been already printed. In
Moore's 'Life', which appeared in 1830, 561 were given. These, in
FitzGreene Halleck's American edition of Byron's 'Works', published in
1847, were increased to 635. The first volume of a third collection,
edited by Mr. W. E. Henley, appeared early in 1897. A comparison of the
number of letters contained in these three collections down to August
22, 1811, shows that Moore prints 61, Halleck 78, and Mr. Henley 88. In
other words, the edition of 1897, which was the most complete so far as
it goes, added 27 letters to that of 1830, and 10 to that of 1847. But
it should be remembered that by far the greater part of the material
added by Halleck and Mr. Henley was seen and rejected by Moore.

The present edition, down to August 22, 1811, prints 168 letters, or an
addition of 107 to Moore, 90 to Halleck, and 80 to Mr. Henley. Of this
additional matter considerably more than two-thirds was inaccessible to
Moore in 1830.

In preparing this volume for the press, use has been also made of a mass
of material, bearing more or less directly on Byron's life, which was
accumulated by the grandfather and father of Mr. Murray. The notes thus
contain, it is believed, many details of biographical interest, which
are now for the first time published.

It is necessary to make these comparisons, in order to define the
position which this edition claims to hold with regard to its
predecessors. On the other hand, no one can regret more sincerely than
myself--no one has more cause to regret--the circumstances which placed
this wealth of new material in my hands rather than in those of the true
poet and brilliant critic, who, to enthusiasm for Byron, and wide
acquaintance with the literature and social life of the day, adds the
rarer gift of giving life and significance to bygone events or trivial
details by unconsciously interesting his readers in his own living
personality.

Byron's letters appeal on three special grounds to all lovers of English
literature. They offer the most suggestive commentary on his poetry;
they give the truest portrait of the man; they possess, at their best,
in their ease, freshness, and racy vigour, a very high literary value.

The present volume, which covers the period from 1798 to August, 1811,
includes the letters written Lord Byron from his eleventh to his
twenty-third year. They therefore illustrate the composition of his
youthful poetry, of 'English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers', and of the
first two cantos of 'Childe Harold'. They carry his history down to the
eve of that morning in March, 1812, when he awoke and found himself
famous--in a degree and to an extent which to the present generation
seem almost incomprehensible.

If the letters were selected for their literary value alone, it is
probable that very few of those contained in the present volume would
find a place in a collection formed on this principle. But biographical
interest also demands consideration, and, in the case of Byron, this
claim is peculiarly strong. He has for years suffered much from the
suppression of the material on which a just estimate of his life may be
formed. It is difficult not to regret the destruction of the 'Memoirs',
in which he himself intended his history to be told. Their loss cannot
be replaced; but their best substitute is found in his letters. Through
them a truer conception of Byron can be formed than any impression which
is derived from Dallas, Leigh Hunt, Medwin, or even Moore. It therefore
seems only fair to Byron, that they should be allowed, as far as
possible, to interpret his career. For other reasons also it appears to
me too late, or too soon, to publish only those letters which possess a
high literary value. The real motive of such a selection would probably
be misread, and thus further misconceptions of Byron's character would
be encouraged.

With one exception, therefore, the whole of the available material has
been published. The exception consists of some of the business letters
written by Byron to his solicitor. Enough of these have been printed to
indicate the pecuniary difficulties which undoubtedly influenced his
life and character; but it was not considered necessary to publish the
whole series. Men of genius ask money from their lawyers in the same
language, and with the same arguments, as the most ordinary persons.

The picture which the letters give of Byron, is, it is believed, unique
in its completeness, while the portrait has the additional value of
being painted by his own hand. Byron's career lends itself only too
easily to that method of treatment, which dashes off a likeness by
vigorous strokes with a full brush, seizing with false emphasis on some
salient feature, and revelling in striking contrasts of light and shade.
But the style here adopted by the unconscious artist is rather that in
which Richardson the novelist painted his pathetic picture of Clarissa
Harlowe. With slow, laborious touches, with delicate gradations of
colour, sometimes with almost tedious minuteness and iteration, the
gradual growth of a strangely composite character is presented,
surrounded by the influences which controlled or moulded its
development, and traced through all the varieties of its rapidly
changing moods. Written, as Byron wrote, with habitual exaggeration, and
on the impulse of the moment, his letters correct one another, and, from
this point of view, every letter contained in the volume adds something
to the truth and completeness of the portrait.

Round the central figure of Byron are grouped his relations and friends,
and two of the most interesting features in the volume are the strength
of his family affections, and the width, if not the depth, of his
capacity for friendship. His father died when the child was only three
years old. But a bundle of his letters, written from Valenciennes to his
sister, Mrs. Leigh, in 1790-91, still exists, to attest, with startling
plainness of speech, the strength of the tendencies which John Byron
transmitted to his son. The following extract contains the father's only
allusion to the boy:--

  "Valenciennes, Feb. 16, 1791.

  Have you never received any letters from me by way of Bologne? I have
  sent two. For God's sake send me some, as I have a great deal to pay.
  With regard to Mrs. Byron, I am glad she writes to you. She is very
  amiable at a distance; but I defy you and all the Apostles to live
  with her two months, for, if any body could live with her, it was me.
  'Mais jeu de Mains, jeu de Vilains'. For my son, I am happy to hear he
  is well; but for his walking, 'tis impossible, as he is club-footed."

Between his mother and himself, in spite of frequent and violent
collisions, there existed a real affection, while the warmth of his love
for his half-sister Augusta, who had much of her brother's power of
winning affection, lost nothing in its permanence from the rarity of
their personal intercourse. Outside the family circle, the volume
introduces the only two men among his contemporaries who remained his
lifelong friends. In his affection for Lord Clare, whom he very rarely
saw after leaving school, there was a tinge of romance, and in him Byron
seems to have personified the best memories of an idealized Harrow. In
Hobhouse he found at once the truest and the most intimate of his
friends, a man whom he both liked and respected, and to whose opinion
and judgment he repeatedly deferred. On Hobhouse's side, the sentiment
which induced him, eminently sensible and practical as he was, to
treasure the nosegay which Byron had given him, long after it was
withered, shows how attractive must have been the personality of the
donor.

Without the 'Dictionary of National Biography', the labour of preparing
the letters for the press would be trebled. Both in the facts which it
supplies, and in the sources of information which it suggests, it is an
invaluable aid.

In conclusion, I desire to express my special obligations to Lord
Lovelace and Mr. Richard Edgcumbe, who have read the greater part of the
proofs, and to both of whom I am indebted for several useful
suggestions.

CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL.

Catherine Gordon of Gight (1765-1811), afterwards Mrs. Byron, and mother
of the poet, was descended on the paternal side from Sir William Gordon
of Gight, the third son, by Annabella Stewart, daughter of James I of
Scotland, of George, second Earl of Huntly, Chancellor of Scotland
(1498-1502), and Lord-Lieutenant of the North from 1491 to his death in
1507. The owners of Gight, now a ruin, once a feudal stronghold, were a
hot-headed, hasty-handed race, sufficiently notable to be commemorated
by Thomas the Rhymer, and to leave their mark in the traditions of
Aberdeenshire. In the seventh generation from Sir William Gordon, the
property passed to an heiress, Mary Gordon. By her marriage with
Alexander Davidson of Newton, who assumed the name of Gordon, she had a
son Alexander, Mrs. Byron's grandfather, who married Margaret Duff of
Craigston, a cousin of the first Earl of Fife. Their eldest son, George,
the fifth of the Gordons of Gight who bore that name, married Catherine
Innes of Rosieburn, and by her became the father of Catherine Gordon,
born in 1765, afterwards Mrs. Byron. Both her parents dying early,
Catherine Gordon was brought up at Banff by her grandmother, commonly
called Lady Gight, a penurious, illiterate woman, who, however, was
careful that her granddaughter was better educated than herself. Thus,
for the second time, Gight, which, with other property, was worth
between £23,000 and £24,000, passed to an heiress.

Miss Catherine Gordon had her full share of feminine vanity. At the age
of thirty-five she was a stout, dumpy, coarse-looking woman, awkward in
her movements, provincial in her accent and manner. But as her son was
vain of his personal appearance, and especially of his hands, neck, and
ears, so she, when other charms had vanished, clung to her pride in her
arms and hands. She exhausted the patience of Stewartson the artist, who
in 1806, after forty sittings, painted her portrait, by her anxiety to
have a particular turn in her elbow exhibited in the most pleasing
light. Of her ancestry she was, to use her son's expression, as "proud
as Lucifer," looked down upon the Byron family, and regarded the Duke of
Gordon as an inferior member of her clan. In later life, at any rate,
her temper was ungovernable; her language, when excited, unrestrained;
her love of gossip insatiable. Capricious in her moods, she flew from
one extreme to the other, passing, for the slightest cause, from
passionate affection to equally passionate resentment. How far these
defects were produced, as they certainly were aggravated, by her
husband's ill treatment and her hard struggle with poverty, it is
impossible to say. She had many good qualities. She bore her ruin, as
her letters show, with good sense, dignity, and composure. She lived on
a miserable pittance without running into debt; she pinched herself in
order to give her son a liberal supply of money; she was warm-hearted
and generous to those in distress. She adored her scamp of a husband,
and, in her own way, was a devoted mother. In politics she affected
democratic opinions, took in the 'Morning Chronicle', and paid for it,
as is shown by a bill sent in after her death, at the rate of £4 17s.
6d. for the half-year--no small deduction from her narrow income. She
was fond of books, subscribed to the Southwell Book Club, copied
passages which struck her in the course of her reading, collected all
the criticisms on her son's poetry, made shrewd remarks upon them
herself (Moore's 'Journal and Correspondence', vol. v. p. 295), and
corresponded with her friends on literary subjects.

In 1785 Miss Catherine Gordon was at Bath, where, it may be mentioned,
her father had, some years before, committed suicide. There she met, and
there, on May 13, 1785, in the parish church of St. Michael, as the
register shows, she married Captain John Byron.

Captain John Byron (1755-91), born at Plymouth, was the eldest son of
Admiral the Hon. John Byron (1723-86)--known in the Royal Navy as "Hardy
Byron" or "Foul-weather Jack"--by his marriage (1748) with Sophia
Trevanion of Carhais, in Cornwall. The admiral, next brother to William,
fifth Lord Byron, was a distinguished naval officer, whose 'Narrative'
of his shipwreck in the 'Wager' was published in 1768, and whose 'Voyage
round the World' in the 'Dolphin' was described by "an officer in the
said ship" in 1767. His eldest son, John Byron, educated at Westminster
and a French Military Academy, entered the Guards and served in America.
A gambler, a spendthrift, a profligate scamp, disowned by his father, he
in 1778 ran away with, and in 1779 married, Lady Carmarthen, wife of
Francis, afterwards fifth Duke of Leeds, née Lady Amelia d'Arcy, only
child and heiress of the last Earl of Holderness, and Baroness Conyers
in her own right.

Captain Byron and his wife lived in Paris, where were born to them a son
and a daughter, both of whom died in infancy, and Augusta, born 1783,
the poet's half-sister, who subsequently married her first cousin,
Colonel George Leigh. In 1784 Lady Conyers died, and Captain Byron
returned to England, a widower, over head and ears in debt, and in
search of an heiress.

It was a rhyme in Aberdeenshire--

  "When the heron leaves the tree,
  The laird of Gight shall landless be."

Tradition has it that, at the marriage of Catherine Gordon with "mad
Jack Byron," the heronry at Gight passed over to Kelly or Haddo, the
property of the Earl of Aberdeen. "The land itself will not be long in
following," said his lordship, and so it proved. For a few months Mrs.
Byron Gordon--for her husband assumed the name, and by this title her
Scottish friends always addressed her--lived at Gight. But the ready
money, the outlying lands, the rights of fishery, the timber, failed to
liquidate Captain Byron's debts, and in 1786 Gight itself was sold to
Lord Aberdeen for £17,850. Mrs. Byron Gordon found herself, at the end
of eighteen months, stripped of her property, and reduced to the income
derived from £4200, subject to an annuity payable to her grandmother.
She bore the reverse with a composure which shows her to have been a
woman of no ordinary courage. Her letters on the subject are sensible,
not ill-expressed, and, considering the circumstances in which they were
written, give a favourable impression of her character.

The wreck of their fortunes compelled Mrs. Byron Gordon and her husband
to retire to France. At the beginning of 1788 she had returned to
London, and on January 22, 1788, at 16, Holles Street (since numbered
24, and now destroyed), in the back drawing-room of the first floor,
gave birth to her only child, George Gordon, afterwards sixth Lord
Byron. Hanson gives the names of the nurse, Mrs. Mills, the man-midwife,
Mr. Combe, the doctor, Dr. Denman, who attended Mrs. Byron at her
confinement. Dallas was, therefore, mistaken in his supposition that the
poet was born at Dover. The child was baptized in London on February 29,
1788, as is proved by the register of the parish of Marylebone.

Shortly after the birth of her son, Mrs. Byron settled in Aberdeen,
where she lived for upwards of eight years. During her stay there, in
the summer of 1791, her husband died at Valenciennes. In the year 1794,
by the death of his cousin William John Byron (1772-94) from a wound
received at the siege of Calvi, in Corsica, her son became the heir to
his great-uncle, the "wicked Lord Byron" (William, fifth Lord Byron,
1722-98), and a solicitor named Hanson was appointed to protect the
boy's interests. From Aberdeen Mrs. Byron kept up a correspondence with
her sister-in-law, Frances Leigh ('née' Byron), wife of General Charles
Leigh, to whom, in a letter, dated March 27, 1791, she speaks of her son
as "very well, and really a charming boy." Writing again to Mrs. Leigh,
December 8, 1794, she says,

  "I think myself much obliged to you for being so interested for
  George; you may be sure I would do anything I could for my son, but I
  really don't see what can be done for him in that case. You say you
  are afraid Lord B. will dispose of the estates that are left, if he
  can; if he has it in his power, nobody can prevent him from selling
  them; if he has not, no one will buy them from him. You know Lord
  Byron. Do you think he will do anything for George, or be at any
  expense to give him a proper education; or, if he wish to do it, is
  his present fortune such a one that he could spare anything out of it?
  You know how poor I am, not that I mean to ask him to do anything for
  him, that is to say, to be of any expense on his account."

If any application was made to the boy's great-uncle, it was
unsuccessful. On May 19, 1798, Lord Byron died, and Hanson informed Mrs.
Byron that her son had succeeded to the title and estates. At the end of
the summer of that year, the little Lord Byron, with his mother and the
nurse May Gray, reached Newstead, and, within a few weeks from their
arrival, his first letter was written. His letters to his mother, it may
be observed, are always addressed to "the Honourable Mrs. Byron," a
title to which she had no claim.


1.--To Mrs. Parker. [1]


  Newstead Abbey, Nov. 8th, 1798.

  Dear Madam,--My Mamma being unable to write herself desires I will let
  you know that the potatoes are now ready and you are welcome to them
  whenever you please.

  She begs you will ask Mrs. Parkyns if she would wish the poney to go
  round by Nottingham or to go home the nearest way as it is now quite
  well but too small to carry me.

  I have sent a young Rabbit which I beg Miss Frances will accept off
  and which I promised to send before. My Mamma desires her best
  compliments to you all in which I join.


  I am, Dear Aunt, yours sincerely,

  BYRON.

  I hope you will excuse all blunders as it is the first letter I ever
  wrote.



[Footnote 1: This letter, the first that Byron wrote, was written when
he was ten years and ten months old. It is preserved in the Library of
Trinity College, Cambridge, and a facsimile is given by Elze, in his
'Life of Lord Byron'.

It is apparently addressed to his aunt, Mrs. Parker. Charlotte Augusta
Byron, daughter of Admiral the Hon. John Byron, married Christopher
Parker (1761-1804), Vice-Admiral 1804, the son of Admiral of the Fleet
Sir Peter Parker, Bart. (1721-1811). Her son, who, on the death of his
grandfather, succeeded to the baronetcy as Sir Peter Parker, second
Bart. (1786-1814), commanded H.M.S. 'Menelaus', and was killed in an
attack on a body of American militia encamped near Baltimore. (See
Byron's "Elegy on the Death of Sir Peter Parker," and his letter to
Moore, October 7, 1814.) Her daughter Margaret, one of Byron's early
loves, inspired, as he says, his "first dash into poetry" (see 'Poems',
vol. i, p. 5, note 1).]





2.--To his Mother.


  Nottingham, 13 March, 1799.

  Dear Mama,--I am very glad to hear you are well. I am so myself, thank
  God; upon my word I did not expect so long a Letter from you; however
  I will answer it as well as I can. Mrs. Parkyns and the rest are well
  and are much obliged to you for the present. Mr. Rogers [1] could
  attend me every night at a separate hour from the Miss Parkynses, and
  I am astonished you do not acquiesce in this Scheme which would keep
  me in Mind of what I have almost entirely forgot. I recommend this to
  you because, if some plan of this kind is not adopted, I shall be
  called, or rather branded with the name of a dunce, which you know I
  could never bear. I beg you will consider this plan seriously and I
  will lend it all the assistance in my power. I shall be very glad to
  see the Letter you talk of, and I have time just to say I hope every
  body is well at Newstead,

  And remain, your affectionate Son,

  BYRON.

  P.S.--Pray let me know when you are to send in the Horses to go to
  Newstead. May [2] desires her Duty and I also expect an answer by the
  miller.



[Footnote 1: Dummer Rogers, "Teacher of French, English, Latin, and
Mathematicks", was, according to 'Notes and Queries' (4th series, vol.
iii. p. 561), an American loyalist, pensioned by the English Government.
He lived at Hen Cross, Nottingham, when Byron was staying in that city,
partly with Mrs. Parkyns, partly at Mr. Gill's, in St. James's Lane, to
be attended by a man named Lavender, "trussmaker to the general
hospital", who had some local reputation for the treatment of misshapen
limbs. Lavender, in 1814 ('Nottingham Directory' for 1814), appears as a
"surgeon". Rogers, who read parts of Virgil and Cicero with Byron,
represents him as, for his age, a fair scholar. He was often, during his
lessons, in violent pain, from the position in which his foot was kept;
and Rogers one day said to him, "It makes me uncomfortable, my Lord, to
see you sitting there in such pain as I know you must be suffering".
"Never mind, Mr. Rogers," answered the boy; "you shall not see any signs
of it in _me_." Many years after, when in the neighbourhood of
Nottingham, Byron sent a kind message to his old instructor, bidding the
bearer tell him that he could still recite twenty verses of Virgil which
he had read with Rogers when suffering torture all the time.

p. 10, note 1).]





3.--To John Hanson. [1]

  SIR,--I am not a little disappointed at your Stay, for this last week
  I expected you every hour; but, however, I beg it as a favour that you
  will come up soon from Newstead as the Holidays commence in three
  weeks Time. I congratulate you on Capt. Hanson's [1] being appointed
  commander of The 'Brazen' Sloop of War, and I congratulate myself on
  Lord Portsmouth's [2] Marriage, hoping his Lady, when he and I meet
  next, will keep him in a little better order. The manner I knew that
  Capt. Hanson was appointed Commander of the Ship before mentioned was
  this. I saw it in the public Paper, and now, since you are going to
  Newstead, I beg if you meet Gray [3] send her a packing as fast as
  possible, and give my Compliments to Mrs. Hanson and to all my
  comrades of the Battalions in and out upon different Stations,

  And remain, your little friend,

  BYRON.

  I forgot to tell you how I was. I am at present very well and my foot
  goes but indifferently; I cannot perceive any alteration.





[Footnote 1: John Hanson, of 6, Chancery Lane, a well-known London
solicitor, was introduced to the Byron family by an Aberdeenshire friend
of Mrs. Byron, Mr. Farquhar, a member of Parliament, and a civilian
practising in Doctors' Commons. The acquaintance began in January, 1788,
with Byron's birth, for the midwife and the nurse were recommended by
Mrs. Hanson. Six years later, Hanson was employed by Mrs. Byron to watch
the interests of her son, who in 1794 had become heir-presumptive to his
great-uncle. It was Hanson who, in the summer of 1798, communicated the
news of the death of Lord Byron to Mrs. Byron, and with his wife
received her and her son at Newstead. From that time till the close of
the minority, Hanson was intimately associated with Byron, both as a man
of business and a friend. He selected Dr. Glennie's school for the boy,
persuaded Lord Carlisle to become his guardian, introduced the ward to
Lord Carlisle, and entered him at Harrow. It was at his house in Earl's
Court that Byron, for five years, spent a considerable part of his
successive holidays. There he made acquaintance with Hanson's
children--his sons Charles, Hargreaves (his contemporary at Harrow), and
Newton, and his daughter, Mary Anne, who subsequently (March 7, 1814)
married the Earl of Portsmouth, Byron giving her away. This letter was
written by Byron a few weeks after he had gone to school at Dr.
Glennie's, in Lordship Lane, Dulwich. He remained there from August,
1799, to April, 1801.

In a letter to Mrs. Byron, dated September 1, 1799, Hanson describes Dr.
Glennie's "Academy," where he had shortly before left the boy:--

  "I left my entertaining companion with Mr. Glennie last Thursday week,
  and I have since learnt from him that he is very comfortable and likes
  the situation. His schoolfellows are very fine youths, and their
  deportment does very great credit to their Preceptor. I succeeded in
  getting Lord Byron a separate room, and I am persuaded the greatest
  attention will be paid to him. Mr. Glennie is a Scotchman, has
  travelled a great deal, and seems every way qualified for his present
  situation."



[Footnote 2: Captain James Hanson, R.N., was the brother of John Hanson
to whom the letter is written. Byron was born with a caul, prized by
sailors as a preservative from drowning. The caul was sold by Mrs.
Mills, the nurse who attended Mrs. Byron in January, 1788, to Captain
Hanson. In January, 1800, Captain Hanson, in command of H.M.S. 'Brazen',
had captured a French vessel, which he sent to Portsmouth with a prize
crew. On the 26th of the month, while shorthanded, he was caught in a
storm off Newhaven. The 'Brazen' foundered, and Captain Hanson with all
his men, except one, were drowned.]


[Footnote 3: In the late autumn of 1799 Lord Portsmouth was staying with
the Hansons before his marriage (November 23, 1799) with Miss Norton,
sister of Lord Grantley. In rough play he pinched Byron's ear; the boy
picked up a conch shell which was lying on the ground, and hurled it at
Lord Portsmouth's head, missing it by a hair's breadth, and smashing the
glass behind. In vain Mrs. Hanson tried to make the peace by saying that
Byron did not mean the missile for Lord Portsmouth. "But I 'did' mean
it!" he reiterated; "I will teach a fool of an earl to pinch another
noble's ear."]


[Footnote: 4. The following extract from a letter written by Hanson to
Mrs. Byron (September 1, 1799) places the character of Byron's nurse in
a different light to that which is given in Moore's 'Life':--

  "I assure you, Madam, I should not have taken the liberty to have
  interfered in your domestic Arrangements, had I not thought it
  absolutely necessary to apprize you of the proceedings of your
  Servant, Mrs. Gray; her conduct towards your son while at Nottingham
  was shocking, and I was persuaded you needed but a hint of it to
  dismiss her. Mrs. Parkyns, when I saw her, said something to me about
  her; but when I found from dispassionate persons at Nottingham, it was
  the general Topic of conversation, it would have ill become me to have
  remained silent.

  My honourable little companion, tho' disposed to retain his feelings,
  could not refrain, from the harsh usage he had received at her hands,
  from complaining to me, and such is his dread of the Woman that I
  really believe he would forego the satisfaction of seeing you if he
  thought he was to meet her again. He told me that she was perpetually
  beating him, and that his bones sometimes ached from it; that she
  brought all sorts of Company of the very lowest Description into his
  apartments; that she was out late at nights, and he was frequently
  left to put himself to bed; that she would take the Chaise-boys into
  the Chaise with her, and stopped at every little Ale-house to drink
  with them. But, Madam, this is not all; she has even----traduced
  yourself.

  I entertain a very great affection for Lord Byron, and I trust I shall
  not be considered solely in my professional character, but as his
  Friend. I introduced him to my Friends, Lord Grantley and his Brother
  General Norton, who were vastly taken with him, as indeed are every
  one. And I should be mortified in the highest degree to see the
  honourable feelings of my little fellow exposed to insult by the
  inordinate Indiscretions of any Servant. He has Ability and a
  quickness of Conception, and a correct Discrimination that is seldom
  seen in a youth, and he is a fit associate of men, and choice indeed
  must be the Company that is selected for him."]





4.--To his Mother.


  Harrow-on-the-Hill, Sunday, May 1st, 1803.

  MY DEAR MOTHER,--I received your Letter the other day. And am happy to
  hear you are well. I hope you will find Newstead in as favorable a
  state as you can wish. I wish you would write to Sheldrake to tell him
  to make haste with my shoes. [1]

  I am sorry to say that Mr. Henry Drury [2] has behaved himself to me
  in a manner I neither'can' nor 'will bear'. He has seized now an
  opportunity of showing his resentment towards me. To day in church I
  was talking to a Boy who was sitting next me; 'that' perhaps was not
  right, but hear what followed. After Church he spoke not a word to me,
  but he took this Boy to his pupil room, where he abused me in a most
  violent manner, called me 'blackguard', said he 'would' and 'could'
  have me expelled from the School, and bade me thank his 'Charity' that
  'prevented' him; this was the Message he sent me, to which I shall
  return no answer, but submit my case to 'you' and those you may think
  'fit' to 'consult'. Is this fit usage for any body? had I 'stole' or
  behaved in the most 'abominable' way to him, his language could not
  have been more outrageous. What must the boys think of me to hear such
  a Message ordered to be delivered to me by a 'Master'? Better let him
  take away my life than ruin my 'Character'. My Conscience acquits me
  of ever 'meriting' expulsion at this School; I have been 'idle' and I
  certainly ought not to talk in church, but I have never done a mean
  action at this School to him or 'any one'. If I had done anything so
  'heinous', why should he allow me to stay at the School? Why should he
  himself be so 'criminal' as to overlook faults which merit the
  'appellation' of a 'blackguard'? If he had had it in his power to have
  me expelled, he would long ago have 'done' it; as it is, he has done
  'worse'. If I am treated in this Manner, I will not stay at this
  School. I write you that I will not as yet appeal to Dr. Drury; his
  Son's influence is more than mine and 'justice' would be 'refused' me.
  Remember I told you, when I 'left' you at 'Bath', that he would seize
  every means and opportunity of revenge, not for leaving him so much as
  the mortification he suffered, because I begged you to let me leave
  him. If I had been the Blackguard he talks of, why did he not of his
  own accord refuse to keep me as his 'pupil'? You know Dr. Drury's
  first letter, in it were these Words: "My son and Lord Byron have had
  some Disagreements; but I hope that his future behaviour will render a
  change of Tutors unnecessary." Last Term I was here but a short time,
  and though he endeavoured, he could find nothing to abuse me in. Among
  other things I forgot to tell you he said he had a great mind to expel
  the Boy for speaking to me, and that if he ever again spoke to me he
  would expel him. Let him explain his meaning; he abused me, but he
  neither did nor can mention anything bad of me, further than what
  every boy else in the School has done. I fear him not; but let him
  explain his meaning; 'tis all I ask. I beg you will write to Dr. Drury
  to let him know what I have said. He has behaved to me, as also Mr.
  Evans, very kindly. If you do not take notice of this, I will leave
  the School myself; but I am sure 'you' will not see me 'ill treated';
  better that I should suffer anything than this. I believe you will be
  tired by this time of reading my letter, but, if you love me, you will
  now show it. Pray write me immediately. I shall ever remain, Your
  affectionate Son, BYRON.

  P.S.--Hargreaves Hanson desires his love to you and hopes you are very
  well. I am not in want of any Money so will not ask you for any. God
  bless, bless you.



[Footnote 1: Byron appears to have suffered from what would now be
described as infantile paralysis, which affected the inner muscles of
the right leg and foot, and rendered him permanently lame. Before
leaving London for Aberdeen, Mrs. Byron consulted John Hunter, who, in
correspondence with Dr. Livingstone of Aberdeen, advised her as to the
treatment of her son. Writing, May 31, 1791, to Mrs. Leigh, she says,
"George's foot turns inward, and it is the right foot; he walks quite on
the side of his foot." In 1798 the child was placed under the care of
Lavender (see p. 7, note 1) at Nottingham, doubtless on the
recommendation of his aunt. In July, 1799, he was taken to London, in
order to consult Dr. Baillie. From July, 1799, till the end of 1802, he
was attended by Baillie in consultation with Dr. Laurie of 2,
Bartholomew's Close. Special appliances were made for the boy, under
their superintendence, by a scientific bootmaker named Sheldrake, in the
Strand. In 'The Lancet' for 1827-8 (vol. ii. p. 779) Mr. T. Sheldrake
describes "Lord Byron's case," giving an illustration of the foot. His
account does not tally, in some respects, with that taken from
contemporary letters, and his sketch represents the left not the right
leg. But the nature and extent of Byron's lameness have been the subject
of a curious variety of opinion. Lady Blessington, Moore, Gait, the
Contessa Albrizzi, never knew which foot was deformed. Jackson, the
boxer, thought it was the 'left' foot. Trelawney says that it proceeded
from a contraction of the back sinews, and that the 'right' foot was
most distorted. The lasts from which his shoes were made by Swift, the
Southwell bootmaker, are preserved in the Nottingham Museum, and in both
the foot is perfect in shape. The last pair of shoes modelled on them
were made May 7, 1807. Mrs. Leigh Hunt says that the 'left' foot was
shrunken, but was not a club-foot. Stendhal says the 'right' foot.
Thorwaldsen indicates the 'left' foot. Dr. James Millingen, who
inspected the feet after the poet's death, says that there was a
malformation of the 'left' foot and leg, and that he was born
club-footed. Two surgical boots are in the possession of Mr. Murray,
made for Byron as a child; both are for the 'right' foot, ankle, and
leg, and, assuming that they were made to fit the foot, they are too
long and thin for a club-foot. Both at Dulwich and at Harrow, Byron was
frequently seen by Laurie, whom Mrs. Byron paid, as she once complained
in a letter to Laurie, "at the rate of £150 a year." It is difficult to
see what more could have been done for the boy, and the explanation of
the failure to effect a cure is probably to be found in the following
extracts from two of Laurie's letters to Mrs. Byron. The first is dated
December 7, 1801:--

  "Agreeable to your desire, I waited on Lord Byron at Harrow, and I
  think it proper to inform you that I found his foot in a much worse
  state than when I last saw it,--the shoe entirely wet through and the
  brace round his ancle quite loose. I much fear his extreme inattention
  will counteract every exertion on my part to make him better. I have
  only to add that with proper care and bandaging, his foot may still be
  greatly recovered; but any delay further than the present vacation
  would render it folly to undertake it."

The second letter is dated October 2, 1802. In it Laurie complains that
the boy had spent several days in London without seeing him, and adds--

  "I cannot help lamenting he has so little sense of the Benefit he has
  already received as to be so apparently neglectful."]



[Footnote 2: For Henry Drury (afterwards an intimate friend of Byron)
and his father, the Head-master of Harrow, see p. 41, note 2.

When Byron went to Harrow, in April, 1801, he was placed in Henry
Drury's house. But in January, 1803, he refused to go back to school
unless he was removed from Drury's care. He was in consequence placed at
Evans's house. Dr. Drury, writing to explain the new arrangement, says,
in a letter to Hanson, dated February 4, 1803--

  "The reason why Lord Byron wishes for this change arises from the
  repeated complaints of Mr. Henry Drury respecting his Inattention to
  Business, and his propensity to make others laugh and disregard their
  Employments as much as himself. On this subject I have had many very
  serious conversations with him, and though Mr. H. D. had repeatedly
  requested me to withdraw him from his Tuition, yet, relying on my own
  remonstrances and arguments to rectify his Error, and on his own
  reflection to confirm him in what is right, I was unwilling to accede
  to my son's wishes. Lord Byron has now made the request himself; I am
  glad it has been made, as he thereby imposes on himself an additional
  responsibility, and encourages me to hope that by this change he
  intends to lay aside all that negligence and those Childish Practices
  which were the cause of former complaints."

Fresh troubles soon arose, as Byron's letter indicates. Hanson forwarded
the boy's complaint to Dr. Drury, from whom he received the following
answer, dated May 15, 1803:--

  "The Perusal of the inclosed has allowed me to inquire into the whole
  Matter, and to relieve your young friend's Mind from any uneasy
  impression it might have sustained from a hasty word I fairly confess.
  I am sorry it was ever uttered; but certainly it was never intended to
  make so deep a wound as his letter intimates.

  "I may truly say, without any parade of words, that I am deeply
  interested in Lord Byron's welfare. He possesses, as his letter
  proves, a mind that feels, and that can discriminate reasonably on
  points in which it conceives itself injured. When I look forward to
  the Possibility of the exercise of his Talents hereafter, and his
  supplying the Deficiencies of fortune by the exertion of his abilities
  and by application, I feel particularly hurt to see him idle, and
  negligent, and apparently indifferent to the great object to be
  pursued. This event, and the conversations which have passed between
  us relative to it, will probably awaken in his mind a greater degree
  of emulation, and make him studious of acquiring Distinction among his
  Schoolfellows, as well as of securing to himself the affectionate
  regard of his Instructors."]





5.--To his Mother.


  Harrow-on-the-Hill, June 23rd, 6th, 8th, 30th, 1803.

  My dear Mother,--I am much obliged to you for the Money you sent me. I
  have already wrote to you several times about writing to Sheldrake: I
  wish you would write to him, or Mr. Hanson to call on him, to tell him
  to make an Instrument for my leg immediately, as I want one, rather. I
  have been placed in a higher form in this School to day, and Dr. Drury
  and I go on very well; write soon, my Dear Mother.

  I remain, your affectionate Son,

  BYRON.





6.--To his Mother. [1]


  Southwell, [Sept. 1803].

  MY DEAR MOTHER,--I have sent Mealey [2] to day to you, before William
  came, but now I shall write myself. I _promise_ you, upon my _honour_,
  I will come over tomorrow in the _Afternoon_. I was not wishing to
  resist your _Commands_, and really seriously intended coming over
  tomorrow, ever since I received your last Letter; you know as well as
  I do that it is not your Company I dislike, but the place you reside
  in. I know it is time to go to Harrow. It will make me _unhappy_; but
  I will _obey_. I only desire, entreat, this one day, and on my
  _honour_ I will be over tomorrow in the evening or afternoon. I am
  sorry you disapprove my Companions, who, however, are the first this
  County affords, and my equals in most respects; but I will be
  permitted to chuse for myself. I shall never interfere in your's and I
  desire you will not molest me in mine. If you grant me this favour,
  and allow me this one day unmolested, you will eternally oblige your

  Unhappy Son,

  BYRON.


  I shall attempt to offer no excuse as you do not desire one. I only
  entreat you as a Governor, not as a Mother, to allow me this one day.
  Those that I most love live in this County; therefore in the name of
  Mercy I entreat this one day to take leave, and then I will join you
  again at Southwell to prepare to go to a place where--I will write no
  more; it would only incense you. Adieu. Tomorrow I come.



[Footnote 1: This letter is endorsed by Hanson, "Lord Byron to his
mother, "1803". In September, 1803, at the end of the summer holidays,
Byron did not return to Harrow. Dr. Drury asked the reason, received no
reply, and, on October 4, applied to Hanson for an explanation. Hanson's
inquiry drew from Mrs. Byron, on October 30, the following answer, with
which was enclosed the above letter from Byron:--

  "You may well be surprized, and so may Dr. Drury, that Byron is not
  returned to Harrow. But the Truth is, I cannot get him to return to
  school, though I have done all in my power for six weeks past. He has
  no indisposition that I know of, but love, desperate love, the 'worst'
  of all 'maladies' in my opinion. In short, the Boy is distractedly in
  love with Miss Chaworth, and he has not been with me three weeks all
  the time he has been in this county, but spent all his time at
  Annesley.

  If my son was of a proper age and the lady 'disengaged', it is the
  last of all connexions that I would wish to take place; it has given
  me much uneasiness. To prevent all trouble in future, I am determined
  he shall not come here again till Easter; therefore I beg you will
  find some proper situation for him at the next Holydays. I don't care
  what I pay. I wish Dr. Drury would keep him.

  I shall go over to Newstead to-morrow and make a 'last effort' to get
  him to Town."

The effort, if made, failed. On November 7, 1803, Mrs. Byron wrote
again:--

  "Byron is really so unhappy that I have agreed, much against my
  inclination, to let him remain in this County till after the next
  Holydays."

It was not till January, 1804, that Byron returned to Harrow.

Miss Mary Anne Chaworth, the object of Byron's passion, was then living
with her mother, Mrs. Clarke, at Annesley, near Newstead (see 'Poems',
vol. i. p. 189, and note 1). The grand-niece of the Mr. Chaworth who
was killed in a duel by William, fifth Lord Byron, on January 26, 1765
('Annual Register', 1765, pp. 208-212; and 'State Trials', vol. xix. pp.
1178-1236), and the heiress of Annesley, she married, in August, 1805,
John Musters, by whom she had a daughter, born in 1806. (See "Well! thou
art happy!" 'Poems', vol. i. p. 277; see also, for other allusions to
Mrs. Chaworth Musters, 'ibid'., pp. 210, 239, 282, 285; and "The Dream"
of July, 1816.) In Byron's memorandum-book, he describes a visit which
he paid to Matlock with Miss Chaworth's mother, her stepfather Mr.
Clarke, some friends, "and 'my' M. A. C. Alas! why do I say MY? Our
union would have healed feuds in which blood had been shed by our
fathers,--it would have joined lands broad and rich, it would have
joined at least 'one' heart, and two persons not ill matched in years
(she is two years my elder) and--and--and--'what' has been the
result?" ('Life', p. 27).

Mrs. Musters, after an unhappy married life, died in February, 1832, at
Wiverton Hall, near Nottingham.

The connection between the families of Chaworth and Byron came through
the marriage of William, third Lord Byron (died 1695), with Elizabeth
Chaworth (died 1683), daughter of George Chaworth, created (1627)
Viscount Chaworth of Armagh (Thoroton's 'Nottinghamshire', vol. i. p.
198).]

7.--To the Hon. Augusta Byron. [1]


  [At 63, Portland Place, London.]

  Burgage Manor, [Thursday], March 22d, 1804.

  Although, My ever Dear Augusta, I have hitherto appeared remiss in
  replying to your kind and affectionate letters; yet I hope you will
  not attribute my neglect to a want of affection, but rather to a
  shyness naturally inherent in my Disposition. I will now endeavour as
  amply as lies in my power to repay your kindness, and for the Future I
  hope you will consider me not only as _a Brother_ but as your warmest
  and most affectionate _Friend_, and if ever Circumstances should
  require it your _protector_. Recollect, My Dearest Sister, that you
  are _the nearest relation_ I have in _the world both by the ties of
  Blood_ and _affection_. If there is anything in which I can serve you,
  you have only to mention it; Trust to your Brother, and be assured he
  will never betray your confidence. When You see my Cousin and future
  Brother George Leigh, [2] tell him that I already consider him as my
  Friend, for whoever is beloved by you, my amiable Sister, will always
  be equally Dear to me.

  I arrived here today at 2 o'clock after a fatiguing Journey, I found
  my Mother perfectly well. She desires to be kindly remembered to you;
  as she is just now Gone out to an assembly, I have taken the first
  opportunity to write to you, I hope she will not return immediately;
  for if she was to take it into her head to peruse my epistle, there is
  one part of it which would produce from her a panegyric on _a friend
  of yours_, not at all agreeable to me, and I fancy, _not particularly
  delightful to you_. If you see Lord Sidney Osborne [3] I beg you will
  remember me to him; I fancy he has almost forgot me by this time, for
  it is rather more than a year Since I had the pleasure of Seeing
  him.--Also remember me to poor old Murray; [4] tell him we will see
  that something is to be done for him, for _while I live he shall never
  be abandoned In his old Age_. Write to me Soon, my Dear Augusta, And
  do not forget to love me, In the meantime, I remain, more than words
  can express, your ever sincere, affectionate

  Brother and Friend,

  BYRON.

  P.S. Do not forget to knit the purse you promised me, Adieu my beloved
  Sister.



[Footnote: 1. The Hon. Augusta Byron, Byron's half-sister (January,
1783-November, 1851), was the daughter of Captain John Byron by his
first wife, Amelia d'Arcy (died 1784), only child of the last Earl of
Holderness, Baroness Conyers in her own right, the divorced wife of
Francis, Marquis of Carmarthen, subsequently fifth Duke of Leeds. After
the return of Captain and Mrs. Byron to London early in 1788, she was
brought up by her grandmother, the Countess of Holderness. When the
latter died, Augusta Byron divided her time between her half-sister,
Lady Mary Osborne, who married, July 16, 1801, Lord Pelham, subsequently
(1805) Earl of Chichester; her half-brother George, who succeeded his
father as sixth Duke of Leeds in 1799; her cousin, the Earl of Carlisle;
and General and Mrs. Harcourt. From their houses her letters during the
period 1803-7 are written. In 1807 she married her first cousin, Colonel
George Leigh of the Tenth Dragoons, the son of General Charles Leigh, by
Frances, daughter of Admiral the Hon. John Byron. By her husband, who
was a friend of the Prince Regent and well known in society, she was the
mother of seven children. Their home was at Newmarket, till, in April,
1818, they were granted apartments in Flag Court, St. James's Palace,
where she died in November, 1851.

Augusta Byron seems scarcely to have seen her brother between his
infancy and 1802. Lady Holderness and Mrs. Byron were not on friendly
terms, and it was not till the former's death that any intimacy was
renewed between the brother and sister. Writing on October 18, 1801, to
Augusta Byron, Mrs. Byron says, in allusion to the death of Lady
Holderness,

  "As I wish to bury what is past in _oblivion_, I shall avoid all
  reflections on a person now no more; my opinion of yourself I have
  suspended for some years; the time is now arrived when I shall form a
  very _decided_ one. I take up my pen now, however, to condole with you
  on the melancholy event that has happened, to offer you every
  consolation in my power, to assure you of the inalterable regard and
  friendship of myself and son. We will be extremely happy if ever we
  can be of any service to you, now or at any future period. I take it
  upon me to answer for him; although he knows so little of you, he
  often mentions you to me in the most affectionate manner, indeed the
  goodness of his heart and amiable disposition is such that your being
  his sister, had he never seen you, would be a sufficient claim upon
  him and ensure you every attention in his power to bestow.

  Ah, Augusta, need I assure you that you will ever be dear to me as the
  Daughter of the man I tenderly loved, as the sister of my beloved, my
  darling Boy, and I take God to witness you _once_ was dear to me on
  your own account, and may be so _again_. I still recollect with a
  degree of horror the many _sleepless_ nights, and days of _agony_, I
  have passed by your bedside drowned in tears, while you lay insensible
  and at the gates of death. Your recovery certainly was wonderful, and
  thank God I did my duty. These days you cannot remember, but I never
  will forget them ... Your brother is at Harrow School, and, if you
  wish to see him, I have now no desire to keep you asunder."

From 1802 till Byron's death, Augusta took in him the interest of an
elder sister. Writing to Hanson (June 17, 1804), she says--

  "Pray write me a line and mention all you hear of my dear Brother: he
  was a most delightful correspondent while he remained in
  Nottinghamshire: but I can't obtain a single line from Harrow. I was
  much struck with his _general improvement_; it was beyond the
  expectations raised by what you had told me, and his letters gave me
  the most excellent opinion of both his _Head_ and _Heart_."

In this tone the letters are continued (see extracts p. 39; p. 45,
note 1; and p. 97 [Letter 48], [Foot]note 1 [further down]).

From the end of 1805, with some interruptions, and less regularity, the
correspondence between brother and sister was maintained to the end of
Byron's life. To Augusta, then Mrs. Leigh, Byron sent a presentation
copy of 'Childe Harold', with the inscription:

  "To Augusta, my dearest sister, and my best friend, who has ever loved
  me much better than I deserved, this volume is presented by her
  father's son and most affectionate brother."

She was the god-mother of Byron's daughter Augusta Ada, born December
10, 1815. In January, 1816, when Lady Byron was still with her husband,
she writes of and to Mrs. Leigh:

  "In this at least, I _am_ 'truth itself,' when I say that, whatever
  the situation may be, there is no one whose society is dearer to me,
  or can contribute more to my happiness."

Lady Byron left Byron on January 15, 1816. Writing to Mrs. Leigh from
Kirby Mallory, she speaks of her as her "best comforter," notices her
absolute unselfishness, and says that Augusta's presence in Byron's
house in Piccadilly is her "great comfort" (Lady Byron's letters to Mrs.
Leigh, January 16 and January 23, 1816, quoted in the 'Quarterly Review'
for October, 1869, p. 414). Through Mrs. Leigh passed many
communications between Byron and Lady Byron after the separation. To
her, Byron, in 1816 and 1817, wrote the two sets of "Stanzas to
Augusta," the "Epistle to Augusta," and the Journal of his journey
through the Alps, "which contains all the germs of 'Manfred' (letter to
Murray, August, 1817). She was in his thoughts on the Rhine, and in the
third canto of 'Childe Harold':--

  "But one thing want these banks of Rhine,
  Thy gentle hand to clasp in mine."

To her he was writing a letter at Missolonghi (February 23, 1824), which
he did not live to finish, "My dearest Augusta, I received a few days
ago your and Lady Byron's report of Ada's health." He carried with him
everywhere the pocket Bible which she had given him. "I have a Bible,"
he told Dr. Kennedy ('Conversations'), "which my sister gave me, who is
an excellent woman, and I read it very often." His last articulate words
were "My sister--my child."

Several volumes of Mrs. Leigh's commonplace books are in existence,
filled with extracts mostly on religious topics. She was, wrote the late
Earl Stanhope, in a letter quoted in the 'Quarterly Review' (October,
1869, p. 421), "very fond" of talking about Byron.

  "She was," he continues, "extremely unprepossessing in her person and
  appearance--more like a nun than anything, and never can have had the
  least pretension to beauty. I thought her shy and sensitive to a fault
  in her mind and character."

Frances, Lady Shelley, who died in January, 1873, and was intimately
acquainted with Byron and his contemporaries, speaks of her as a
"Dowdy-Goody."

  "I have seen," she writes

(see 'Quarterly Review', October, 1869, p. 421, quoting from
a letter signed E. M. U., which appeared in the 'Times' for September
II, 1869),

  "a great deal of Mrs. Leigh (Augusta), having passed some days with
  her and Colonel Leigh, for my husband's shooting near Newmarket, when
  Lord Byron was in the house, and, as she told me, was writing 'The
  Corsair', to my great astonishment, for it was a wretched small house,
  full of her ill-trained children, who were always running up and down
  stairs, and going into 'uncle's' bedroom, where he remained all the
  morning."]


[Footnote 2: See preceding note.]


[Footnote 3: Francis, fifth Duke of Leeds, married, October 14, 1788, as
his second wife, Miss Catherine Anguish, by whom he had two children:
the eldest, a son, Sydney Godolphin Osborne, was born December 16,
1789.]


[Footnote 4: Joe Murray had been for many years in the employment of
William, fifth Lord Byron. At his master's death, in 1798, he was
taken into the service of the Duke of Leeds.

  "I saw poor Joseph Murray the other night," writes Augusta Byron to
  Hanson (June 17, 1804), "who wishes me particularly to apply to Col.
  Leigh, to get him into some City Charity which the Prince of Wales is
  at the head of.

  I cannot understand what he means, nor can any body else, and
  therefore, as he said he was advised by you, I think it better to
  apply to you on the subject. I'm sure Col. Leigh would be happy to
  oblige him; but in general he dislikes _asking favours_ of the
  _Prince_, and this present moment is a bad one to chuse for the
  purpose, as H.R.H. is so much taken up with _public affairs_. I am
  very anxious about poor Joseph, and would almost do anything to serve
  him. I fear he is too old and infirm to go to service again."

Three years later (March 19, 1807), Augusta Byron writes again
to Hanson:--

  "I have just had a pitiful note from poor old Murray, telling me of
  his dismissal from the Duchess of Leeds; but he says he does not leave
  her till June. I therefore hope something may in the mean time be done
  for him. He requests me to write word of it to my Brother. I shall
  certainly comply with his wishes, and send _two lines_ on that subject
  to Southwell, where I conclude he is."

Byron made Murray an allowance of £20 a year (see Letter 83), took him,
as soon as he could, into his service, and was careful, as he promises,
to provide that he should not be "abandoned in his old age." His
affection for Murray is marked by the postscript to the letter to Mrs.
Byron of June 22, 1809 (see also 'Life', pp. 74, 121); as also by his
draft will of 1811, in which he leaves Murray £50 a year for life.





8.--To the Hon. Augusta Byron.


  [63, Portland Place, London.]

  Southwell, March 26th, 1804.


  I received your affectionate letter, my ever Dear Sister, yesterday
  and I now hasten to comply with your injunction by answering it as
  soon as possible. Not, my Dear Girl, that it can be in the least
  irksome to me to write to you, on the Contrary it will always prove my
  Greatest pleasure, but I am sorry that I am afraid my correspondence
  will not prove the most entertaining, for I have nothing that I can
  relate to you, except my affection for you, which I can never
  sufficiently express, therefore I should tire you, before I had half
  satisfied myself. Ah, How unhappy I have hitherto been in being so
  long separated from so amiable a Sister! but fortune has now
  sufficiently atoned by discovering to me a relation whom I love, a
  Friend in whom I can confide. In both these lights, my Dear Augusta, I
  shall ever look upon you, and I hope you will never find your Brother
  unworthy of your affection and Friendship.

  I am as you may imagine a little dull here; not being on terms of
  intimacy with Lord Grey [1] I avoid Newstead, and my resources of
  amusement are Books, and writing to my Augusta, which, wherever I am,
  will always constitute my Greatest pleasure. I am not reconciled to
  Lord Grey, _and I never will_. He was once my _Greatest Friend_, my
  reasons for ceasing that Friendship are such as I cannot explain, not
  even to you, my Dear Sister, (although were they to be made known to
  any body, you would be the first,) but they will ever remain hidden in
  my own breast.

  They are Good ones, however, for although I am _violent_ I am not
  _capricious_ in my _attachments_. My mother disapproves of my
  quarrelling with him, but if she knew the cause (which she never will
  know,) She would reproach me no more. He Has forfeited all _title to
  my esteem_, but I hold him in too much _contempt_ ever _to hate him_.
  My mother desires to be kindly remembered to you. I shall soon be in
  town to resume my studies at Harrow; I will certainly call upon you in
  my way up. Present my respects to Mrs. Harcourt; [2] I am Glad to hear
  that I am in her Good Graces for I shall always esteem her on account
  of her behaviour to you, my Dear Girl. Pray tell me If you see Lord S.
  Osborne, and how he is; what little I know of him I like very much and
  If we were better acquainted I doubt not I should like him still
  better. Do not forget to tell me how Murray is. As to your Future
  prospects, my Dear Girl, _may they be happy_! I am sure you deserve
  Happiness and if _you_ do not meet with it I shall begin to think it
  is "a bad world we live in." Write to me soon. I am impatient to hear
  from you. God bless you, My amiable Augusta, I remain,

  Your ever affectionate Brother and Friend,

  BYRON.



[Footnote 1: Henry, third Earl of Sussex, died in 1799, when the earldom
lapsed. He was, however, succeeded in the ancient barony of Grey de
Ruthyn by his daughter's son, Henry Edward, twentieth Baron Grey de
Ruthyn (1780-1810), to whom Newstead was let.

  "I am glad," writes Mrs. Byron to Hanson, March 10, 1803, "that
  Newstead is well let. I cannot find Lord Grey de Ruthin's Title in the
  Peerage of England, Ireland, or Scotland. I suppose he is a _new_
  Peer."

Lord Grey de Ruthyn married, in 1809, Anna Maria, daughter of William
Kelham, of Ryton-upon-Dunsmore, Warwick. (See postscript to Byron's
Letter to his mother, August 11, 1809.) The lease of Newstead terminated
in April, 1808.]

married, in 1778, Mary, daughter of the Rev. William Danby, and widow of

9.--To the Hon. Augusta Byron.


  [At General Harcourt's, St. Leonard's Hill, Windsor, Berkshire.]

  Burgage Manor, April 2d, 1804.


  I received your present, my beloved Augusta, which was very
  acceptable, not that it will be of any use as a token of remembrance,
  No, my affection for you will never permit me to forget you.

  I am afraid, my Dear Girl, that you will be absent when I am in town.
  I cannot exactly say when I return to Harrow, but however it will be
  in a very short time. I hope you were entertained by Sir Wm. Fawcet's
  funeral on Saturday. [1] Though I should imagine such spectacles rather
  calculated to excite Gloomy ideas. But I believe _your motive was not
  quite of so mournful a cast_.

  You tell me that you are tired of London. I am rather surprised to
  hear that, for I thought the Gaieties of the Metropolis were
  particularly pleasing to _young ladies_. For my part I detest it; the
  smoke and the noise feel particularly unpleasant; but however it is
  preferable to this horrid place, where I am oppressed with _ennui_,
  and have no amusement of any kind, except the conversation of my
  mother, which is sometimes very _edifying_, but not always very
  _agreeable_. There are very few books of any kind that are either
  instructive or amusing, no society but old parsons and old Maids;--I
  shoot a Good deal; but, thank God, I have not so far lost my reason as
  to make shooting my only amusement. There are indeed some of my
  neighbours whose only pleasures consist in field sports, but in other
  respects they are only one degree removed from the brute creation.

  These however I endeavour not to imitate, but I sincerely wish for the
  company of a few friends about my own age to soften the austerity of
  the scene. I am an absolute Hermit; in a short time my Gravity which
  is increased by my solitude will qualify me for an Archbishoprick; I
  really begin to think that I should become a mitre amazingly well. You
  tell me to write to you when I have nothing better to do; I am sure
  writing to you, my Dear Sister, must ever form my Greatest pleasure,
  but especially so, at this time. Your letters and those of one of my
  Harrow friends form my only resources for driving away _dull care_.
  For Godsake write me a letter as long as may fill _twenty sheets_ of
  paper, recollect it is my only pleasure, if you won't Give me twenty
  sheets, at least send me as long an epistle as you can and as soon as
  possible; there will be time for me to receive one more Letter at
  Southwell, and as soon as I Get to Harrow I will write to you. Excuse
  my not writing more, my Dear Augusta, for I am sure you will be
  sufficiently tired of reading this complaining narrative. God bless
  you, my beloved Sister. Adieu.

  I remain your sincere and affectionate

  Friend and Brother,

  BYRON.

  Remember me kindly to Mrs. Harcourt.

10.--To the Hon. Augusta Byron.


  [At General Harcourt's, St. Leonard's Hill, Windsor, Berkshire.]

  Burgage Manor, April 9th, 1804.


  A thousand thanks, my dear and Beloved Augusta, for your affectionate
  Letter, and so ready compliance with the request of a peevish and
  fretful Brother; it acted as a cordial on my drooping spirits and for
  a while dispelled the Gloom which envelopes me in this uncomfortable
  place. You see what power your letters have over me, so I hope you
  will be liberal in your epistolary consolation.

  You will address your next letter to Harrow as I set out from
  Southwell on Wednesday, and am sorry that I cannot contrive to be with
  you, as I must resume my studies at Harrow directly. If I speak in
  public at all, it will not be till the latter end of June or the
  beginning of July. You are right in your conjecture for I feel not a
  little nervous in the anticipation _of my Debut_ [1] as _an orator_.
  By the bye, I do not dislike Harrow. I find _ways_ and _means_ to
  amuse _myself very pleasantly_ there; the friend, whose correspondence
  I find so amusing, is an old sporting companion of mine, whose
  recitals of Shooting and Hunting expeditions are amusing to me as
  having often been his companion in them, and I hope to be so still
  oftener.

  My mother Gives a _party_ to night at which the principal _Southwell
  Belles_ will be present, with one of which, although I don't as yet
  know whom I shall so far _honour, having never seen them_, I intend to
  _fall violently_ in love; it will serve as an amusement _pour passer
  le temps_ and it will at least have the charm of novelty to recommend
  it, then you know in the course of a few weeks I shall be quite _au
  désespoir_, shoot myself and Go out of the world with _éclat_, and my
  History will furnish materials for a pretty little Romance which shall
  be entitled and denominated the loves of Lord B. and the cruel and
  Inconstant Sigismunda Cunegunda Bridgetina, etc., etc., Princess of
  Terra Incognita.

  Don't you think that I have a very good Knack for _novel writing_? I
  have Just this minute been called away from writing to you by two
  Gentlemen who have given me an invitation to go over to Screveton, a
  village a few miles off, and spend a few days; but however I shall not
  accept it, so you will continue to address your letters to Harrow as
  usual. Write to me as soon as possible and give me a long letter.
  Remember me to Mrs. Harcourt and all who enquire after me. Continue to
  love me and believe me,

  Your truly affectionate Brother and Friend,

  BYRON.

  P.S.--My Mother's love to you, Adieu.

Of Byron's oratorical powers, Dr. Drury, Head-master of Harrow, formed a
high opinion.

"The upper part of the school," he writes (see 'Life', p. 20), composed
declamations, which, after a revisal by the tutors, were submitted to
the master. To him the authors repeated them, that they might be
improved in manner and action, before their public delivery. I certainly
was much pleased with Lord Byron's attitude, gesture, and delivery, as
well as with his composition. All who spoke on that day adhered, as
usual, to the letter of their composition, as, in the earlier part of
his delivery, did Lord Byron; but, to my surprise, he suddenly diverged
from the written composition, with a boldness and rapidity sufficient to
alarm me, lest he should fail in memory as to the conclusion. There was
no failure; he came round to the close of his composition without
discovering any impediment and irregularity on the whole. I questioned
him why he had altered his declamation. He declared he had made no
alteration, and did not know, in speaking, that he had deviated from it
one letter. I believed him; and, from a knowledge of his temperament, am
convinced that, fully impressed with the sense and substance of the
subject, he was hurried on to expressions and colourings more striking
than what his pen had expressed."

  "My qualities," says Byron, in one of his note-books (quoted by Moore,
  'Life', p. 20), "were much more oratorical and martial than poetical;
  and Dr. Drury, my grand patron (our head-master), had a great notion
  that I should turn out an orator, from my fluency, my turbulence, my
  voice, my copiousness of declamation, and my action. I remember that
  my first declamation astonished him into some unwonted (for he was
  economical of such) and sudden compliments before the declaimers at
  our first rehearsal."

For his subjects Byron chose passages expressive of vehement passion,
such as Lear's address to the storm, or the speech of Zanga over the
body of Alonzo, from Young's tragedy 'The Revenge'. Zanga's character
and speech are famous in history from their application to Benjamin
Franklin, in Wedderburn's speech before the Privy Council (January,
1774) on the Whately Letters (Stanhope's 'History of England', vol. v.
p. 327, ed. 1853):--

  "I forg'd the letter, and dispos'd the picture,
  I hated, I despis'd, and I destroy."]

11.--To the Hon. Augusta Byron.


  Burgage Manor, August 18th, 1804.


  MY DEAREST AUGUSTA,--I seize this interval of my _amiable_ mother's
  absence this afternoon, again to inform you, or rather to desire to be
  informed by you, of what is going on. For my own part I can send
  nothing to amuse you, excepting a repetition of my complaints against
  my tormentor, whose _diabolical_ disposition (pardon me for staining
  my paper with so harsh a word) seems to increase with age, and to
  acquire new force with Time. The more I see of her the more my dislike
  augments; nor can I so entirely conquer the appearance of it, as to
  prevent her from perceiving my opinion; this, so far from calming the
  Gale, blows it into a _hurricane_, which threatens to destroy
  everything, till exhausted by its own violence, it is lulled into a
  sullen torpor, which, after a short period, is again roused into fresh
  and revived phrenzy, to me most terrible, and to every other Spectator
  astonishing. She then declares that she plainly sees I hate her, that
  I am leagued with her bitter enemies, viz. Yourself, L'd C[arlisle]
  and Mr. H[anson], and, as I never Dissemble or contradict her, we are
  all _honoured_ with a multiplicity of epithets, too _numerous_, and
  some of them too _gross_, to be repeated. In this society, and in this
  amusing and instructive manner, have I dragged out a weary fortnight,
  and am condemned to pass another or three weeks as happily as the
  former. No captive Negro, or Prisoner of war, ever looked forward to
  their emancipation, and return to Liberty with more Joy, and with more
  lingering expectation, than I do to my escape from this maternal
  bondage, and this accursed place, which is the region of dullness
  itself, and more stupid than the banks of Lethe, though it possesses
  contrary qualities to the river of oblivion, as the detested scenes I
  now witness, make me regret the happier ones already passed, and wish
  their restoration.

  Such Augusta is the happy life I now lead, such my _amusements_. I
  wander about hating everything I behold, and if I remained here a few
  months longer, I should become, what with _envy, spleen and all
  uncharitableness_, a complete _misanthrope_, but notwithstanding this,

  Believe me, Dearest Augusta, ever yours, etc., etc.,

  BYRON.





12.--To Elizabeth Bridget Pigot. [1]

  Burgage Manor, August 29, 1804.


  I received the arms, my dear Miss Pigot, and am very much obliged to
  you for the trouble you have taken. It is impossible I should have any
  fault to find with them. The sight of the drawings gives me great
  pleasure for a double reason,--in the first place, they will ornament
  my books, in the next, they convince me that _you_ have not entirely
  _forgot_ me. I am, however, sorry you do not return sooner--you have
  already been gone an _age_. I perhaps may have taken my departure for
  London before you come back; but, however, I will hope not. Do not
  overlook my watch-riband and purse, as I wish to carry them with me.
  Your note was given me by Harry, [2] at the play, whither I attended
  Miss Leacroft, [3] and Dr. S----; and now I have sat down to answer it
  before I go to bed. If I am at Southwell when you return,--and I
  sincerely hope you will soon, for I very much regret your absence,--I
  shall be happy to hear you sing my favourite, "The Maid of Lodi." [4]
  My mother, together with myself, desires to be affectionately
  remembered to Mrs. Pigot, and, believe me, my dear Miss Pigot, I
  remain, your affectionate friend,

  BYRON.

  P.S.--If you think proper to send me any answer to this, I shall be
  extremely happy to receive it. Adieu.

  P.S.2d.--As you say you are a novice in the art of knitting, I hope it
  don't give you too much trouble. Go on _slowly_, but surely. Once
  more, adieu.



[Footnote 1: Elizabeth Bridget Pigot lived with her mother and two
brothers on Southwell Green, in a house opposite Burgage Manor. Miss
Pigot thus describes her first meeting with Byron ('Life', p. 32):--

  "The first time I was introduced to him was at a party at his
  mother's, when he was so shy that she was forced to send for him three
  times before she could persuade him to come into the drawing-room, to
  play with the young people at a round game. He was then a fat, bashful
  boy, with his hair combed straight over his forehead, and extremely
  like a miniature picture that his mother had painted by M. de
  Chambruland. The next morning Mrs. Byron brought him to call at our
  house, when he still continued shy and formal in his manner. The
  conversation turned upon Cheltenham, where we had been staying, the
  amusements there, the plays, etc.; and I mentioned that I had seen the
  character of Gabriel Lackbrain very well performed. His mother getting
  up to go, he accompanied her, making a formal bow, and I, in allusion
  to the play, said, 'Good-by, Gaby.' His countenance lighted up, his
  handsome mouth displayed a broad grin, all his shyness vanished, never
  to return, and, upon his mother's saying, 'Come, Byron, are you
  ready?'--no, she might go by herself, he would stay and talk a little
  longer; and from that moment he used to come in and go out at all
  hours, as it pleased him, and in our house considered himself
  perfectly at home."

The character of "Gabriel Lackbrain," mentioned above, occurs in 'Life',
a comedy by F. Reynolds. It was at Byron's suggestion that Moore, when
preparing the 'Life', applied to Miss Pigot for letters. On January 22,
1828, he was taken to call on her and her mother by the Rev. John
Becher.

  "Their reception of me most cordial and flattering; made me sit in the
  chair which Byron used to sit in, and remarked, as a singularity, that
  this was the poor fellow's birthday; he would to-day have been forty.
  On parting with Mrs. Pigot, a fine, intelligent old lady, who has been
  bedridden for years, she kissed my hand most affectionately, and said
  that, much as she had always admired me as a poet, it was as the
  friend of Byron she valued and loved me ... Her affection, indeed, to
  his memory is unbounded, and she seems unwilling to allow that he had
  a single fault ... Miss Pigot in the evening, with his letters, which
  interested me exceedingly; some written when he was quite a boy, and
  the bad spelling and scrambling handwriting delightful; spelling,
  indeed, was a very late accomplishment with him"

('Diary of Thomas Moore', vol. v. p. 249). (See "To Eliza," 'Poems',
vol. i. pp.47-49; see also the lines "To M. S. G.," 'Poems', vol. i. pp.
79, 80; see for the lines which Byron wrote in her copy of Burns,
'Poems', vol. i. pp. 233, 234.)

Miss Pigot died at Southwell in 1866, her brother John (see letter of
August 9, 1806, p. 100, note 3) in 1871. Her brother Henry, whom Byron
used to call his grandson, died October 28, 1830, a captain in the 23rd
Native Infantry in the service of the East India Company.

The following undated note (1810) from Mrs. Pigot to Mrs. Byron
illustrates the enthusiastic interest with which the Pigots followed
Byron's career:--

  "Indeed, my dear Mrs. Byron, you have given me a very 'great treat' in
  sending me 'English Bards' to look at; you know how very highly I
  thought of the 'first' edition, and this is certainly much improved;
  indeed, I do not think anybody but Lord Byron could (in these our
  days) have produced such a work, for it has all the fire of ancient
  genius. I have always been accustomed to tell you my thoughts most
  sincerely, and I cannot say that I like that addition to the part
  where 'Bowles' is mentioned; it wants that 'brilliant spirit' which
  almost invariably accompanies Lord B.'s writings. Maurice, too, and
  his granite weight of leaves, is in truth a heavy comparison. But I
  turn with pleasure from these specks in the sun to notice 'Vice and
  folly, Greville and Argyle;' it is 'most admirable': the 'same pen'
  may 'equal', but I think it is not in the power of human abilities to
  'exceed' it. As to Lord Carlisle, I think he well deserves the Note
  Lord B. has put in; I am 'very much' pleased with it, and the little
  word 'Amen' at the end, gives a point 'indescribably good'. The whole
  of the conclusion is excellent, and the Postscript I think must
  entertain everybody except 'Jeffrey'. I hope the poor Bear is well; I
  wish you could make him understand that he is 'immortalized', for, if
  'four-leg'd Bears' have any vanity, it would certainly delight him.
  Walter Scott, too (I really do not mean to call him a Bear), will be
  highly gratified: the compliment to him is very elegant: in short, I
  look upon it as a most 'highly finished' work, and Lord Byron has
  certainly taken the Palm from 'all our' Poets.... A good account of
  yourself I assure you will always give the most sincere pleasure to my
  dear Mrs. Byron's very affectionate friend, Margt. Pigot. Elizabeth
  begs her compts."]

[Footnote 3: Miss Julia Leacroft, daughter of a neighbour, Mr. John
Leacroft. (See lines "To Lesbia," 'Poems', vol. i. pp. 41-43.) The
private theatricals in September, 1806 (see p. 117 [Letter 81],
[Foot]note 3 [4]), were held at Mr. Leacroft's house. Later, Captain
Leacroft expostulated with Byron on his attentions to his sister, and,
according to Moore, threatened to call him out. Byron was ready to meet
him; but afterwards, on consulting Becher, resolved never to go near the
house again.--'Prose and Verse of Thomas Moore', edited by Richard Herne
Shepherd (London, 1878), p. 420. (But see Letters 62, 63, 64.) ]


[Footnote 4: By Dibdin, set to music by Shield. (See Moore's 'Life', p.
33.) Byron's love for simple ballad music lasted throughout his life. As
a boy at Harrow, he was famous for the vigour with which he sang "This
Bottle's the Sun of our Table" at Mother Barnard's. He liked the Welsh
air "Mary Anne," sung by Miss Chaworth; the songs in 'The Duenna'; "When
Time who steals our Years away," which he sang with Miss Pigot; or
"Robin Adair," in which he was accompanied by Miss Hanson on her harp.

  "It is very odd," he said to Miss Pigot, "I sing much better to your
  playing than to any one else's."

  "That is," she answered, "because I play to your singing."

Moore ('Journal and Correspondence', vol. v. pp. 295, 296), speaking of
"Byron's chanting method of repeating poetry," says that "it is the men
who have the worst ears for music that 'sing' out poetry in this manner,
having no nice perception of the difference there ought to be between
animated reading and 'chant'." Rogers ('Table-Talk, etc.', pp. 224, 225)
expresses the same opinion, when he says, "I can discover from a poet's
versification whether or not he has an ear for music. To instance poets
of the present day:--from Bowles's and Moore's, I should know that they
had fine ears for music; from Southey's, Wordsworth's, and Byron's, that
they had no ears for it."]





13.-To the Hon. Augusta Byron.


  [Castle Howard, Malton, Yorkshire.]

  Harrow-on-the-Hill, October 25th, 1804.


  My dear Augusta,--In compliance with your wishes, as well as gratitude
  for your affectionate letter, I proceed as soon as possible to answer
  it; I am glad to hear that _any body_ gives a good account of me; but
  from the quarter you mention, I should imagine it was exaggerated.
  That you are unhappy, my dear Sister, makes me so also; were it in my
  power to relieve your sorrows you would soon recover your spirits; as
  it is, I sympathize better than you yourself expect. But really, after
  all (pardon me my dear Sister), I feel a little inclined to laugh at
  you, for love, in my humble opinion, is utter nonsense, a mere jargon
  of compliments, romance, and deceit; now, for my part, had I fifty
  mistresses, I should in the course of a fortnight, forget them all,
  and, if by any chance I ever recollected one, should laugh at it as a
  dream, and bless my stars, for delivering me from the hands of the
  little mischievous Blind God. Can't you drive this Cousin [1] of ours
  out of your pretty little head (for as to _hearts_ I think they are
  out of the question), or if you are so far gone, why don't you give
  old L'Harpagon [2] (I mean the General) the slip, and take a trip to
  Scotland, you are now pretty near the Borders. Be sure to Remember me
  to my formal Guardy Lord Carlisle, [3] whose magisterial presence I
  have not been into for some years, nor have I any ambition to attain
  so great an honour. As to your favourite Lady Gertrude, I don't
  remember her; pray, is she handsome? I dare say she is, for although
  they are a _disagreeable, formal, stiff_ Generation, yet they have by
  no means plain _persons_, I remember Lady Cawdor was a sweet, pretty
  woman; pray, does your sentimental Gertrude resemble her? I have heard
  that the duchess of Rutland was handsome also, but we will say nothing
  about her temper, as I hate Scandal.

  Adieu, my pretty Sister, forgive my levity, write soon, and God bless
  you.

  I remain, your very affectionate Brother,

  BYRON.

  P.S.--I left my mother at Southwell, some time since, in a monstrous
  pet with you for not writing. I am sorry to say the old lady and
  myself don't agree like lambs in a meadow, but I believe it is all my
  own fault, I am rather too fidgety, which my precise mama objects to,
  we differ, then argue, and to my shame be it spoken fall out a
  _little_, however after a storm comes a calm; what's become of our
  aunt the amiable antiquated Sophia? [4] is she yet in the land of the
  living, or does she sing psalms with the _Blessed_ in the other world.
  Adieu. I am happy enough and Comfortable here. My friends are not
  numerous, but select; among them I rank as the principal Lord
  Delawarr, [5] who is very amiable and my particular friend; do you
  know the family at all? Lady Delawarr is frequently in town, perhaps
  you may have seen her; if she resembles her son she is the most
  amiable woman in Europe. I have plenty of acquaintances, but I reckon
  them as mere Blanks. Adieu, my dear Augusta.

[Footnote 3: Frederick Howard, fifth Earl of Carlisle (1748-1825), was,
on his mother's side, connected with the Byron family. The Hon. Isabella
Byron (1721-1795), daughter of the fourth Lord Byron, married, in 1742,
Henry, fourth Earl of Carlisle. She subsequently, after the death of
Lord Carlisle (1758), married, as her second husband, Sir William
Musgrave. She was a woman of considerable ability, and apparently, in
later life, of eccentric habits--a "recluse in pride and rags." She was
the reputed writer of some published poetry, and of 'Maxims addressed to
Young Ladies'. Some of these maxims might have been of use to her
grand-nephew: "Habituate yourself to that way of life most agreeable to
the person to whom you are united; be content in retirement, or with
society, in town, or country." Her 'Answer' to Mrs. Greville's ode on
'Indifference' has more of the neck-or-nothing temper of the Byrons:--

  "Is that your wish, to lose all sense
  In dull lethargic ease,
  And wrapt in cold indifference,
  But half be pleased or please?
  ...
  It never shall be my desire
  To bear a heart unmov'd,
  To feel by halves the gen'rous fire,
  Or be but half belov'd.

  Let me drink deep the dang'rous cup,
  In hopes the prize to gain,
  Nor tamely give the pleasure up
  For fear to share the pain.

  Give me, whatever I possess,
  To know and feel it all;
  When youth and love no more can bless,
  Let death obey my call."

Lady Carlisle's son, Frederick, who was educated at Eton and Cambridge,
succeeded his father as fifth Earl of Carlisle, in 1758, when he was ten
years old. After leaving Cambridge, he started on a continental tour
with two Eton friends--Lord FitzWilliam and Charles James Fox. A lively
letter-writer, his correspondence with his friend George Selwyn, while
in Italy, shows him to have been a young man of wit, feeling, and taste.
It is curious to notice that, at Rome, he singles out, like his cousin
in 'Childe Harold' or 'Manfred', as the most striking objects, the
general aspect of the "marbled wilderness", the moonlight view of the
amphitheatre, the Laocoon, the Belvedere Apollo, and the group of Niobe
and her daughters. One other taste he shared with Byron--he was a lover
of dogs, and "Rover" was his constant companion abroad.

Lord Carlisle returned to England in 1769. Like Fox, he was a prodigious
dandy. They "once travelled from Paris to Lyons for the express purpose
of buying waistcoats; and during the whole journey they talked of
nothing else" ('Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers', pp. 73, 74). Already well
known in London society, Carlisle was a close friend of George Selwyn, a
familiar figure at White's and Brookes's, an inveterate gambler, an
adorer of Lady Sarah Bunbury, who, as Lady Sarah Lennox, had won the
heart of George III. The flirtation provoked from Lord Holland an
adaptation of 'Lydia, dic per omnes':--

  "Sally, Sally, don't deny,
  But, for God's sake, tell me why
  You have flirted so, to spoil
  That once lively youth, Carlisle?
  He used to mount while it was dark;
  Now he lies in bed till noon,
  And, you not meeting in the park,
  Thinks that he gets up too soon," etc.

In 1770 Lord Carlisle married Lady Margaret Leveson Gower, a beautiful
and charming woman. "Everybody," writes Lord Holland to George Selwyn
(May 2, 1770), "says it is impossible not to admire Lady Carlisle." But
matrimony did not at once steady his character. For the next few
years--though in 1773 he published a volume of 'Poems'--his pursuits
were mainly those of a young man of fashion, and he impoverished himself
at the gaming-table. From 1777 onwards, however, his life took a more
serious turn. In that year he became Treasurer of the Household, and was
sworn a member of the Privy Council. In 1778 he was the chief of the
three commissioners sent out by Lord North to negotiate with the United
States. There he declined a challenge from Lafayette, provoked by
reflections on the French court and nation, which he had issued with his
fellow-commissioners in their political capacity. In 1779 he was
nominated Lord-Lieutenant of Yorkshire, and First Lord of Trade and
Plantations. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from 1780 to 1782, and
held the post of Lord Privy Seal in the Duke of Portland's
administration of 1783. Till the outbreak of the French Revolutionary
wars, he was an opponent of Pitt; but after 1792 he consistently
supported the Government.

Carlisle was a collector of pictures, statuary, and works of art. He was
also a writer of verse, tragedies, and pamphlets; but, in literature,
his admirable letters are his best claim to be remembered. One of his
two tragedies, 'The Father's Revenge' (1783), was praised by Walpole,
and received the guarded approval of Dr. Johnson. His published poetry
consisted of an ode on the death of Gray, verses on that of Lord Nelson,
"Lines for the Monument of a favourite Spaniel," an address to Sir
Joshua Reynolds, and translations from Dante. The first two poems
provoked Richard Tickell to write the 'Wreath of Fashion' (1780). "The
following lines," says Tickell, in his "Advertisement," were "occasioned
by the Author's having lately studied, with infinite attention, several
fashionable productions in the 'Sentimental' stile.... For example, A
Noble Author has lately published his works, which consist of 'three'
compositions: 'one' an Ode upon the death of Mr. Gray; the two others
upon the death of his Lordship's 'Spaniel'."

  "Here, placid 'Carlisle' breathes his gentle line,
  Or haply, gen'rous 'Hare', re-echoes thine.
  Soft flows the lay: as when, with tears, He paid
  The last sad honours to his------Spaniel's shade!
  And lo! he grasps the badge of wit, a wand;
  He waves it thrice and 'Storer' is at hand."

His contemporaries seem to have thought that his poetry, weak though it
was, was indebted to his Eton friends, "the Hare with many friends," and
Antony Storer. The latter's name is linked with that of Carlisle in
another satire, 'Pandolfo Attonito':--

  "Fall'n though I am, I ne'er shall mourn,
  Like the dark Peer on Storer's urn,"

where a note refers to "Antony Storer, formerly Member for Morpeth ('as
some persons' near Carlisle and Castle Howard 'may possibly recollect'),
a gentleman well known in the circles of fashion and polite literature."
Carlisle's name occurs in many of the satires of the day on literary
subjects. 'The Shade of Pope' (ii. 191, 192) says--

  "Carlisle is lost with Gillies in surprize,
  As Lysias charms soft Jersey's classic eyes;"

and in the 'Pursuits of Literature' (Dialogue ii. line 234), a note to
the line--

  "While lyric Carlisle purrs o'er love transformed,"

again associates his name with that of Lady Jersey.

In 1799 Lord Carlisle was persuaded by Hanson to become Byron's
guardian, in order to facilitate legal proceedings for the recovery of
the Rochdale property, illegally sold by William, fifth Lord Byron. He
was introduced to his ward by Hanson, who took the boy to Grosvenor
Place, to see his guardian and consult Dr. Baillie in July, 1799. He
seemed anxious to befriend the boy; but Byron was eager, as Hanson
notes, to leave the house. When Mrs. Byron, in 1800, was anxious to
remove her son from Dr. Glennie's care, Carlisle exercised his
authority, and forbade the schoolmaster to give him up to his mother. He
probably, on this occasion, experienced Mrs. Byron's temper, for Augusta
Byron, writing to Hanson (November 18, 1804), says that he dreaded
"having any concern whatever with Mrs. Byron." Byron does not seem to
have met his guardian again till January, 1805, when Augusta Byron
writes to Hanson:

  "I hear from Lady Gertrude Howard that Lord Carlisle was 'very much'
  pleased with my brother, and I am sure, from what he said to me at
  Castle Howard, is disposed to show him all the kindness and attention
  in his power. I know you are so partial to Byron and so much
  interested in all that concerns him, that you will rejoice almost as
  much as I do that his acquaintance with Lord C. is renewed. In the
  mean time it is a great comfort for me to think that he has spent his
  Holydays so comfortably and so much to his wishes. You will easily
  believe that he is a 'very great favourite of mine', and I may add the
  more I see and hear of him, the more I 'must' love and esteem him."

It may be doubted whether Carlisle ever saw the dedication of 'Hours of
Idleness'. Augusta Byron, in a letter to Hanson of February 7, 1807,
says,

  "I return you my Brother's poems with many Thanks. Mrs. B. has had the
  attention to send me 2 copies. I like some of them very much: but you
  will laugh when I tell you I have never had courage to shew them to
  Lord Carlisle for fear of his disapproving others."

The years 1806-7, spent at Southwell, as his sister says, "in idleness
and ill humour with the whole World," were not the most creditable of
Byron's life, and Carlisle's efforts to make him return to Cambridge
failed. It is, moreover, certain that in 1809 Carlisle was ill; it is
also probable that at a time when the scandal of Mary Anne Clarke and
the Duke of York threatened to come before the House of Lords, he was
unwilling to connect himself in public with a cousin of whom he knew no
good, and of whose political views he was ignorant. These causes may
have combined to produce the coldly formal letter, in which he told
Byron the course of procedure to be adopted in taking his seat in the
House of Lords, and ignored the young man's wish that his cousin and
guardian should introduce him. (For Byron's attack upon Carlisle, and
his subsequent admission of having done him "some wrong," see 'English
Bards, and Scotch Reviewers', lines 723-740; and 'Childe Harold', Canto
III. stanzas xxix., xxx.)

It is possible that the "paralytic puling" may have been suggested by
the "placid purring" of previous satirists. In March, 1814, his sister
Augusta was trying hard to persuade Byron, as he notes in his Diary,

  "to make it up with Carlisle. I have refused 'every' body else, but I
  can't deny her anything, though I had as leif 'drink up Eisel--eat a
  crocodile.'"

Lord Carlisle had three daughters: the eldest, Lady Caroline Isabella
Howard, married, in 1789, John, first Lord Cawdor, and died in 1848; the
second, Lady Elizabeth, married, in 1799, John Henry, fifth Duke of
Rutland, and died in 1825; the third, Lady Gertrude, married, in 1806,
William Sloane Stanley, of Paultons, Hants, and died in 1870.]


[Footnote 4: No "Aunt Sophia" appears in the pedigree; but his
grandmother was Sophia Trevanion, who married, in 1748, the Hon. John
Byron, afterwards Admiral Byron. Mrs. Byron knew Dr. Johnson well, and
she and Miss Burney were the only two friends who, as Mrs. Piozzi (then
Mrs. Thrale) thought, might regret her departure from Streatham in 1782
('Life and Writings of Mrs. Piozzi', vol. i. p. 171). "Mrs. Byron, who
really loves me," says Mrs. Piozzi ('ibid.', p. 125), "was disgusted at
Miss Burney's carriage to me." In August, 1820, Mrs. Piozzi writes to a
Miss Willoughby, to tell her

  "what wonders Lord Byron is come home to do, for I see his arrival in
  the paper. His grandmother was my intimate friend, a Cornish lady,
  Sophia Trevanion, wife to the Admiral, 'pour ses péchés', and we
  called her Mrs. B_i_ron always, after the French fashion"

('Life and Writings, etc.', vol. ii. pp. 456, 457)' Mrs. Byron
died at Bath in 1790.]


[Footnote 5: Lady Delawarr, widow of John Richard, fourth Earl Delawarr,
whom she married in 1783, died in 1826. Her only son, George John, fifth
earl, succeeded his father in 1795. He went from Harrow to Brasenose
College, Oxford; married, in 1813, Lady Elizabeth Sackville; was Lord
Chamberlain 1858-9; and died in 1869. He was the "Euryalus" of "Childish
Recollections" (see 'Poems', vol. i. p. 100; and lines "To George, Earl
of Delawarr," 'ibid.', p. 126).]





14.--To the Hon. Augusta Byron.


  Friday, November 2d, 1804.


  This morning, my dear Augusta, I received your affectionate letter,
  and it reached me at a time when I wanted consolation, not however of
  your kind for I am not yet old enough or Goose enough to be in love;
  no, my sorrows are of a different nature, though more calculated to
  provoke risibility than excite compassion. You must know, Sister of
  mine, that I am the most unlucky wight in Harrow, perhaps in
  Christendom, and am no sooner out of one scrape than into another. And
  to day, this very morning, I had a thundering Jobation from our Good
  Doctor, [1] which deranged my _nervous system_, for at least five
  minutes. But notwithstanding He and I now and then disagree, yet upon
  the whole we are very good friends, for there is so much of the
  Gentleman, so much mildness, and nothing of pedantry in his character,
  that I cannot help liking him, and will remember his instructions with
  gratitude as long as I live. He leaves Harrow soon, _apropos_, so do
  I. This quitting will be a considerable loss to the school. He is the
  best master we ever had, and at the same time respected and feared;
  greatly will he be regretted by all who know him. You tell me you
  don't know my friend L'd Delawarr; he is considerably younger than me,
  but the most good tempered, amiable, clever fellow in the universe. To
  all which he adds the quality (a good one in the eyes of women) of
  being remarkably handsome, almost too much so for a boy. He is at
  present very low in the school, not owing to his want of ability, but
  to his years. I am nearly at the top of it; by the rules of our
  Seminary he is under my power, but he is too goodnatured ever to
  offend me, and I like him too well ever to exert my authority over
  him. If ever you should meet, and chance to know him, take notice of
  him on my account.

  You say that you shall write to the Dowager Soon; her address is at
  Southwell, _that_ I need hardly inform you. Now, Augusta, I am going
  to tell you a secret, perhaps I shall appear undutiful to you, but,
  believe me, my affection for you is founded on a more firm basis. My
  mother has lately behaved to me in such an eccentric manner, that so
  far from feeling the affection of a Son, it is with difficulty I can
  restrain my dislike. Not that I can complain of want of liberality;
  no, She always supplies me with as much money as I can spend, and more
  than most boys hope for or desire. But with all this she is so hasty,
  so impatient, that I dread the approach of the holidays, more than
  most boys do their return from them. In former days she spoilt me; now
  she is altered to the contrary; for the most trifling thing, she
  upbraids me in a most outrageous manner, and all our disputes have
  been lately heightened by my one with that object of my cordial,
  deliberate detestation, Lord Grey de Ruthyn. She wishes me to explain
  my reasons for disliking him, which I will never do; would I do it to
  any one, be assured you, my dear Augusta, would be the first who would
  know them. She also insists on my being reconciled to him, and once
  she let drop such an odd expression that I was half inclined to
  believe the dowager was in love with him. But I hope not, for he is
  the most disagreeable person (in my opinion) that exists. He called
  once during my last vacation; she threatened, stormed, begged me to
  make it up, "he himself loved me, and wished it;" but my reason was so
  excellent--that neither had effect, nor would I speak or stay in the
  same room, till he took his departure. No doubt this appears odd; but
  was my reason known, which it never will be if I can help it, I should
  be justified in my conduct. Now if I am to be tormented with her and
  him in this style, I cannot submit to it. You, Augusta, are the only
  relation I have who treats me as a friend; if you too desert me, I
  have nobody I can love but Delawarr. If it was not for his sake,
  Harrow would be a desert, and I should dislike staying at it. You
  desire me to burn your epistles; indeed I cannot do that, but I will
  take care that They shall be invisible. If you burn any of mine, I
  shall be _monstrous angry_; take care of them till we meet.

  Delawarr [2] and myself are in a manner connected, for one of our
  forefathers in Charles the 1st's time married into their family.
  Hartington, [3] whom you enquire after, is on very good terms with me,
  nothing more, he is of a soft milky disposition, and of a happy apathy
  of temper which defies the softer emotions, and is insensible of ill
  treatment; so much for him. Don't betray me to the Dowager. I should
  like to know your Lady Gertrude, as you and her are so great Friends.
  Adieu, my Sister, write. From

[Footnote 1: The Rev. Joseph Drury, D.D. (1750-1834), educated at
Westminster and Trinity College, Cambridge, was appointed an
Assistant-master at Harrow before he was one and twenty. He was
Head-master from 1784 to 1805. In that year he retired, and till his
death in 1834 lived at Cockwood, in Devonshire, where he devoted himself
to farming. The following statement by Dr. Drury illustrates Byron's
respect for his Head-master ('Life', p. 20):--

"After my retreat from Harrow, I received from him two very affectionate
letters. In my occasional visits subsequently to London, when he had
fascinated the public with his productions, I demanded of him, why, as
in 'duty bound', he had sent none to me? 'Because,' said he, 'you are
the only man I never wish to read them;' but in a few moments, he added,
'What do you think of the 'Corsair'?'"

Dr. Drury married Louisa Heath, sister of the Rev. Benjamin Heath, his
predecessor in the Head-mastership. They had four children, all of whom
have some connection with Byron's life. (1) Henry Joseph Drury
(1778-1841), educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge (Fellow),
Assistant-master at Harrow School, married (December 20, 1808) Ann
Caroline Tayler, and had a numerous family. Mrs. Drury's sister married
the Rev. F. Hodgson (see page 195 [Letter 102], [Foot]note 1). (2)
Benjamin Heath Drury (1782-1835), educated at Eton and King's College,
Cambridge (Fellow), Assistant-master at Eton. (3) Charles Drury
(1788-1869), educated at Harrow and Queen's College, Oxford (Fellow).
(4) Louisa Heath Drury (1787-1873) married John Herman Merivale.

Dr. Drury's brother, Mark Drury, the Lower Master at Harrow, was the
candidate whom Byron supported for the Head-mastership.]


[Footnote 2:  Thomas, third Lord Delawarr, Captain-general of all the
Colonies planted or to be planted in Virginia, died in 1618. His fourth
daughter, Cecilie, widow of Sir Francis Bindlose, married Sir John
Byron, created Lord Byron by Charles I. His fifth daughter, Lucy,
married Sir Robert Byron, brother to Lord Byron. But the first Lord
Byron left no heirs, and the title descended to his brother, Richard
Byron, from whom the poet was descended.]


[Footnote 3: William Spencer, Marquis of Hartington (1790-1858),
succeeded his father as sixth Duke of Devonshire in 1811, and died
unmarried. His sister, Georgiana Dorothy, married, in 1801, Lord
Carlisle's eldest son.]





15.--To the Hon. Augusta Byron.


  Harrow, Saturday, 11th Novr, 1804.


  I thought, my dear Augusta, [1] that your opinion of my _meek mamma_
  would coincide with mine; Her temper is so variable, and, when
  inflamed, so furious, that I dread our meeting; not but I dare say,
  that I am troublesome enough, but I always endeavour to be as dutiful
  as possible. She is so very strenuous, and so tormenting in her
  entreaties and commands, with regard to my reconciliation, with that
  detestable Lord G. [2] that I suppose she has a penchant for his
  Lordship; but I am confident that he does not return it, for he rather
  dislikes her than otherwise, at least as far as I can judge. But she
  has an excellent opinion of her personal attractions, sinks her age a
  good six years, avers that when I was born she was only eighteen, when
  you, my dear Sister, know as well as I know that she was of age when
  she married my father, and that I was not born for three years
  afterwards. But vanity is the weakness of _your sex_,--and these are
  mere foibles that I have related to you, and, provided she never
  molested me, I should look upon them as follies very excusable in a
  woman.

  But I am now coming to what must shock you, as much as it does me,
  when she has occasion to lecture me (not very seldom you will think no
  doubt) she does not do it in a manner that commands respect, and in an
  impressive style. No! did she do that, I should amend my faults with
  pleasure, and dread to offend a kind though just mother. But she flies
  into a fit of phrenzy, upbraids me as if I was the most undutiful
  wretch in existence, rakes up the ashes of my _father_, abuses him,
  says I shall be a true Byrrone, which is the worst epithet she can
  invent. Am I to call this woman mother? Because by nature's law she
  has authority over me, am I to be trampled upon in this manner? am I
  to be goaded with insult, loaded with obloquy, and suffer my feelings
  to be outraged on the most trivial occasions? I owe her respect as a
  Son, But I renounce her as a Friend. What an example does she shew me!
  I hope in God I shall never follow it. I have not told you all, nor
  can I; I respect you as a female, nor, although I ought to confide in
  you as a Sister, will I shock you with the repetition of Scenes, which
  you may judge of by the Sample I have given you, and which to all but
  you are buried in oblivion. Would they were so in my mind! I am afraid
  they never will. And can I, my dear Sister, look up to this mother,
  with that respect, that affection I ought? Am I to be eternally
  subjected to her caprice? I hope not--; indeed a few short years will
  emancipate me from the Shackles I now wear, and then perhaps she will
  govern her passion better than at present.

  You mistake me, if you think I dislike Lord Carlisle; I respect him,
  and might like him did I know him better. For him too my mother has an
  antipathy, why I know not. I am afraid he could be but of little use
  to me, in separating me from her, which she would oppose with all her
  might; but I dare say he would assist me if he could, so I take the
  will for the Deed, and am obliged to him in exactly the same manner as
  if he succeeded in his efforts.

  I am in great hopes, that at Christmas I shall be with Mr. Hanson
  during the vacation, I shall do all I can to avoid a visit to my
  mother wherever she is. It is the first duty of a parent, to impress
  precepts of obedience in their children, but her method is so violent,
  so capricious, that the patience of Job, the versatility of a member
  of the House of Commons could not support it. I revere Dr. Drury much
  more than I do her, yet he is never violent, never outrageous: I dread
  offending him, not however through fear, but the respect I bear him
  makes me unhappy when I am under his displeasure. My mother's
  precepts, never convey instruction, never fix upon my mind; to be sure
  they are calculated, to inculcate obedience, so are chains, and
  tortures, but though they may restrain for a time, the mind revolts
  from such treatment. Not that Mrs. Byron ever injures my _sacred_
  person. I am rather too old for that, but her words are of that rough
  texture, which offend more than personal ill usage. "A talkative woman
  is like an Adder's tongue," so says one of the prophets, but which I
  can't tell, and very likely you don't wish to know, but he was a true
  one whoever he was.

  The postage of your letters, My dear Augusta, don't fall upon me; but
  if they did, it would make no difference, for I am Generally in cash,
  and should think the trifle I paid for your epistles the best laid out
  I ever spent in my life. Write Soon. Remember me to Lord Carlisle,
  and, believe me, I ever am

  Your affectionate Brother and Friend,

  BYRONE.



[Footnote 1: In consequence of this letter, Augusta Byron wrote as
follows to Hanson, and Byron spent the Christmas holidays of 1804 with
his solicitor:--

  "Castle Howard, Nov. 18, 1804.

  My Dear Sir,--I am afraid you will think I presume almost too much
  upon the kind permission you have so often given me of applying to you
  about my Brother's concerns. The reason that induces me now to do so
  is his having lately written me several Letters containing the most
  extraordinary accounts of his Mother's conduct towards him and
  complaints of the uncomfortable Situation he is in during the Holidays
  when with her. All this you will easily imagine has more _vexed_ than
  _surprized_ me. I am quite unhappy about him, and wish I could in any
  way remedy the grievances he confides to me. I wished, as the most
  likely means of doing this, to mention the subject to Lord Carlisle,
  who has always expressed the greatest interest about Byron and also
  shewn me the greatest Kindness. Finding that he did _not object_ to
  it, I yesterday had some conversation with Lord C. on the subject, and
  it is partly by his advice and wishes that I trouble you with this
  Letter. He authorized me to tell you that, if you would allow my
  Brother to spend the next vacation with you (which _he_ seems
  _strongly_ to wish), that it would put it into his power to see more
  of him and shew him more attention than he has hitherto, being
  withheld from doing so from the dread of having any concern whatever
  with Mrs. Byron.

  I need hardly add that it is almost MY first wish that this should be
  accomplished. I am sure you are of my opinion that it is now of the
  greatest consequence to Byron to secure the friendship of Lord C., the
  only relation he has who possesses the _Will_ and _power_ to be of use
  to him. I think the Letters he writes me _quite perfect_ and he does
  not express one sentiment or idea I should wish different; he tells me
  he is soon to leave Harrow, but does not say where he is to go. I
  conclude to Oxford or Cambridge. Pray be so good as to write me a few
  lines on this subject.

  I trust entirely to the interest and friendship you have ever so
  kindly expressed for my Brother, for _my Forgiveness_. Of course you
  will not mention to Mrs. B. having heard from me, as she would only
  accuse me of wishing to estrange her Son from her, which would be very
  far from being the case further than his Happiness and comfort are
  concerned in it. My opinion is that _as_ they cannot agree, they had
  better be separated, for such eternal Scenes of wrangling are enough
  to spoil the very best temper and Disposition in the universe. I shall
  hope to hear from you soon, my dear sir, and remain, Most sincerely
  yours, AUGUSTA BYRON."]

16.--To the Hon. Augusta Byron.


  [Castle Howard, Malton, Yorkshire.]

  Harrow-on-the-Hill, Novr., Saturday, 17th, 1804.


  I am glad to hear, My dear Sister, that you like Castle Howard so
  well, I have no doubt what you say is true and that Lord C. is much
  more amiable than he has been represented to me. Never having been
  much with him and always hearing him reviled, it was hardly possible I
  should have conceived a very _great friendship_ for his L'dship. My
  mother, you inform me, commends my _amiable disposition_ and _good
  understanding;_ if she does this to you, it is a great deal more than
  I ever hear myself, for the one or the other is always found fault
  with, and I am told to copy the _excellent pattern_ which I see before
  me in _herself._ You have got an invitation too, you may accept it if
  you please, but if you value your own comfort, and like a pleasant
  situation, I advise you to avoid Southwell.--I thank you, My dear
  Augusta, for your readiness to assist me, and will in some manner
  avail myself of it; I do not however wish to be separated from _her_
  entirely, but not to be so much with her as I hitherto have been, for
  I do believe she likes me; she manifests that in many instances,
  particularly with regard to money, which I never want, and have as
  much as I desire. But her conduct is so strange, her caprices so
  impossible to be complied with, her passions so outrageous, that the
  evil quite overbalances her _agreeable qualities._ Amongst other
  things I forgot to mention a most _ungovernable appetite_ for Scandal,
  which she never can govern, and employs most of her time abroad, in
  displaying the faults, and censuring the foibles, of her acquaintance;
  therefore I do not wonder, that my precious Aunt, comes in for her
  share of encomiums; This however is nothing to what happens when my
  conduct admits of animadversion; "then comes the tug of war." My whole
  family from the conquest are upbraided! myself abused, and I am told
  that what little accomplishments I possess either in mind or body are
  derived from her and _her alone._

  When I leave Harrow I know not; that depends on her nod; I like it
  very well. The master Dr. Drury, is the most amiable _clergyman_ I
  ever knew; he unites the Gentleman with the Scholar, without
  affectation or pedantry, what little I have learnt I owe to him alone,
  nor is it his fault that it was not more. I shall always remember his
  instructions with Gratitude, and cherish a hope that it may one day be
  in my power to repay the numerous obligations, I am under; to him or
  some of his family.

  Our holidays come on in about a fortnight. I however have not
  mentioned that to my mother, nor do I intend it; but if I can, I shall
  contrive to evade going to Southwell. Depend upon it I will not
  approach her for some time to come if It is in my power to avoid it,
  but she must not know, that it is my wish to be absent. I hope you
  will excuse my sending so short a letter, but the Bell has just rung
  to summon us together. Write Soon, and believe me, Ever your
  affectionate Brother, BYRON.

  I am afraid you will have some difficulty in decyphering my epistles,
  but _that_ I know you will excuse. Adieu. Remember me to Lord
  Carlisle.

  1804.


  MY DEAREST AUGUSTA,--This morning I received your by no means
  unwelcome epistle, and thinking it demands an immediate answer, once
  more take up my pen to employ it in your service. There is no
  necessity for my mother to know anything of my intentions, till the
  time approaches; and when it does come, Mr. H. has only to write her a
  note saying, that, as I could not accept the invitation he gave me
  last holidays, he imagined I might do it now; to this she surely can
  make no objections; but, if she entertained the slightest idea of my
  making any complaint of her very _lenient_ treatment, the scene that
  would ensue beggars all power of description. You may have some little
  idea of it, from what I have told you, and what you yourself know.

  I wrote to you the other day; but you make no mention of receiving my
  letter in yours of the 18th inst. It is however of little importance,
  containing merely a recapitulation of circumstances which I have
  before detailed at full length.

  To Lord Carlisle make my warmest acknowledgements. I feel more
  gratitude, than my feelings can well express; I am truly obliged to
  him for his endeavours, and am perfectly satisfied with your
  explanation of his reserve, though I was hitherto afraid it might
  proceed from personal dislike. I have some idea that I leave Harrow
  these holidays. The Dr., whose character I gave you in my last, leaves
  the mastership at Easter. Who his successor may be I know not, but he
  will not be a better I am confident. You inform me that you intend to
  visit my mother, then you will have an opportunity of seeing what I
  have described, and hearing a great _deal of Scandal_. She does not
  trouble me much with epistolary communications; when I do receive
  them, they are very concise, and much to the purpose. However I will
  do her the justice to say that she behaves, or rather means, well, and
  is in some respects very kind, though her manners are not the most
  conciliating. She likewise expresses a great deal of affection for
  you, but disapproves your marriage, wishes to know my opinion of it,
  and complains that you are negligent and do not write to her or care
  about her. How far her opinion of your love for her is well grounded,
  you best know. I again request you will return my sincere thanks to
  Lord Carlisle, and for the future I shall consider him as more my
  friend than I have hitherto been taught to think. I have more reasons
  than one, to wish to avoid going to Notts, for there I should be
  obliged to associate with Lord G. whom I detest, his manners being
  unlike those of a Gentleman, and the information to be derived from
  him but little except about shooting, which I do not intend to devote
  my life to. Besides, I have a particular reason for not liking him.
  Pray write to me soon. Adieu, my Dear Augusta.

  I remain, your affectionate Brother, BYRON.





18.-To John Hanson [1].


  Saturday, Dec. 1st, 1804.


  MY DEAR SIR,--Our vacation commences on the 5th of this Month, when I
  propose to myself the pleasure of spending the Holidays at your House,
  if it is not too great an Inconvenience. I tell you fairly, that at
  Southwell I should have nothing in the World to do, but play at cards
  and listen to the edifying Conversation of old Maids, two things which
  do not at all suit my inclinations. In my Mother's last Letter I find
  that my poney and pointers are not yet procured, and that Lord Grey is
  still at Newstead. The former I should be very dull at such a place as
  Southwell without; the latter is still more disagreeable to be with. I
  presume he goes on in the old way,--quarrelling with the farmers, and
  stretching his judicial powers (he being now in the commission) to the
  utmost, becoming a torment to himself, and a pest to all around
  him.--I am glad you approve of my Gun, feeling myself happy, that it
  has been tried by so _distinguished_ a _Sportsman_.

  I hope your Campaigns against the Partridges and the rest of the
  feathered Tribe have been attended with no serious
  Consequences--_trifling accidents_ such as the top of a few fingers
  and a Thumb, you _Gentlemen_ of the _city_ being used to, of course
  occasion no interruption to your field sports.

  Your Accommodation I have no doubt I shall be perfectly satisfied
  with, only do exterminate that _vile Generation_ of _Bugs_ which
  nearly ate me up the last Time I _sojourned_ at your House. After
  undergoing the Purgatory of Harrow _board_ and _Lodging_ for three
  Months I shall not be _particular_ or exorbitant in my demands.

  Pray give my best Compliments to Mrs. Hanson and the now
  _quilldriving_ Hargreaves [2]. Till I see you, I remain, Yours, etc.,
  BYRON.



[Footnote 1: Byron spent the Christmas holidays of 1804-5 with the
Hansons. He gave Hanson to understand that it was his wish to leave the
school, and that Dr. Drury agreed with him in the decision. Hanson,
after consulting Lord Carlisle, wrote to Drury, urging that Byron was
too young to leave the school. Drury's reply, dated December 29, 1804,
gave a different colour to the matter.

  "Your letter," he writes, "supposes that Lord Byron was desirous to
  leave school, and that I acquiesced in his Wish: but I must do him the
  Justice to observe that _the wish originated with me._ During his last
  residence at Harrow his conduct gave me much trouble and uneasiness;
  and as two of his Associates were to leave me at Christmas, I
  certainly suggested to him _my wish_ that he might be placed under the
  care of some private Tutor previously to his admission to either of
  the Universities. This I did no less with a view to the forming of his
  mind and manners, than to my own comfort; and I am fully convinced
  that if such a situation can be procured for his Lordship, it will be
  much more advantageous for him than a longer residence at school,
  where his animal spirits and want of judgment may induce him to do
  wrong, whilst his age and person must prevent his Instructors from
  treating him in some respects as a schoolboy. If we part now, we may
  entertain affectionate dispositions towards each other, and his
  Lordship will have left the school with credit; as my dissatisfactions
  were expressed to him only privately, and in such a manner as not to
  affect his public situation in the school."

Finally, however, Dr. Drury, yielding to the appeal of Lord Carlisle and
Hanson, allowed the boy to return to Harrow, and Byron remained at the
school till July, 1805, the last three months being passed under the
rule of Dr. Butler.]


[Footnote 2: Hargreaves Hanson, second son of John Hanson, had just left
Harrow, and was articled as a pupil in his father's business. He died in
1811, at the age of 23.]
