        By thy shut soul's hypocrisy;
        By the perfection of thine art
        Which passed for human thine own heart;
        By thy delight in others' pain,
        And by thy brotherhood of Cain,
        I call upon thee! and compel[av]                               250
        Thyself to be thy proper Hell!

        And on thy head I pour the vial
        Which doth devote thee to this trial;
        Nor to slumber, nor to die,
        Shall be in thy destiny;
        Though thy death shall still seem near
        To thy wish, but as a fear;
        Lo! the spell now works around thee,
        And the clankless chain hath bound thee;
        O'er thy heart and brain together                              260
        Hath the word been passed--now wither!

               SCENE II.--_The Mountain of the Jungfrau_.--
            _Time, Morning_.--MANFRED _alone upon the cliffs._

    _Man_. The spirits I have raised abandon me,
    The spells which I have studied baffle me,
    The remedy I recked of tortured me
    I lean no more on superhuman aid;
    It hath no power upon the past, and for
    The future, till the past be gulfed in darkness,
    It is not of my search.--My Mother Earth![119]
    And thou fresh-breaking Day, and you, ye Mountains,
    Why are ye beautiful? I cannot love ye.
    And thou, the bright Eye of the Universe,                           10
    That openest over all, and unto all
    Art a delight--thou shin'st not on my heart.
    And you, ye crags, upon whose extreme edge
    I stand, and on the torrent's brink beneath
    Behold the tall pines dwindled as to shrubs
    In dizziness of distance; when a leap,
    A stir, a motion, even a breath, would bring
    My breast upon its rocky bosom's bed
    To rest for ever--wherefore do I pause?
    I feel the impulse--yet I do not plunge;                            20
    I see the peril--yet do not recede;
    And my brain reels--and yet my foot is firm:
    There is a power upon me which withholds,
    And makes it my fatality to live,--
    If it be life to wear within myself
    This barrenness of Spirit, and to be
    My own Soul's sepulchre, for I have ceased
    To justify my deeds unto myself--
    The last infirmity of evil. Aye,
    Thou winged and cloud-cleaving minister,                            30
                                                       [_An Eagle passes._
    Whose happy flight is highest into heaven,
    Well may'st thou swoop so near me--I should be
    Thy prey, and gorge thine eaglets; thou art gone
    Where the eye cannot follow thee; but thine
    Yet pierces downward, onward, or above,
    With a pervading vision.--Beautiful!
    How beautiful is all this visible world![120]
    How glorious in its action and itself!
    But we, who name ourselves its sovereigns, we,
    Half dust, half deity, alike unfit                                  40
    To sink or soar, with our mixed essence make
    A conflict of its elements, and breathe
    The breath of degradation and of pride,
    Contending with low wants and lofty will,
    Till our Mortality predominates,
    And men are--what they name not to themselves,
    And trust not to each other. Hark! the note,
                          [_The Shepherd's pipe in the distance is heard._
    The natural music of the mountain reed--
    For here the patriarchal days are not
    A pastoral fable--pipes in the liberal air,                         50
    Mixed with the sweet bells of the sauntering herd;[121]
    My soul would drink those echoes. Oh, that I were
    The viewless spirit of a lovely sound,
    A living voice, a breathing harmony,
    A bodiless enjoyment[122]--born and dying
    With the blest tone which made me!

                   _Enter from below a_ CHAMOIS HUNTER.

    _Chamois Hunter_.                 Even so
    This way the Chamois leapt: her nimble feet
    Have baffled me; my gains to-day will scarce
    Repay my break-neck travail.--What is here?
    Who seems not of my trade, and yet hath reached                     60
    A height which none even of our mountaineers,
    Save our best hunters, may attain: his garb
    Is goodly, his mien manly, and his air
    Proud as a free-born peasant's, at this distance:
    I will approach him nearer.

    _Man_. (_not perceiving the other_). To be thus--
    Grey-haired with anguish, like these blasted pines,
    Wrecks of a single winter, barkless, branchless,[123]
    A blighted trunk upon a curséd root,
    Which but supplies a feeling to Decay--
    And to be thus, eternally but thus,                                 70
    Having been otherwise! Now furrowed o'er
    With wrinkles, ploughed by moments, not by years
    And hours, all tortured into ages--hours
    Which I outlive!--Ye toppling crags of ice!
    Ye Avalanches, whom a breath draws down
    In mountainous o'erwhelming, come and crush me!
    I hear ye momently above, beneath,
    Crash with a frequent conflict;[124] but ye pass,
    And only fall on things that still would live;
    On the young flourishing forest, or the hut                         80
    And hamlet of the harmless villager.

    _C. Hun_. The mists begin to rise from up the valley;
    I'll warn him to descend, or he may chance
    To lose at once his way and life together.

    _Man_. The mists boil up around the glaciers; clouds
    Rise curling fast beneath me, white and sulphury,
    Like foam from the roused ocean of deep Hell,[aw]
    Whose every wave breaks on a living shore,
    Heaped with the damned like pebbles.--I am giddy.[125]

    _C. Hun_. I must approach him cautiously; if near,                  90
    A sudden step will startle him, and he
    Seems tottering already.

    _Man_.                  Mountains have fallen,
    Leaving a gap in the clouds, and with the shock
    Rocking their Alpine brethren; filling up
    The ripe green valleys with Destruction's splinters;
    Damming the rivers with a sudden dash,
    Which crushed the waters into mist, and made
    Their fountains find another channel--thus,
    Thus, in its old age, did Mount Rosenberg--[126]
    Why stood I not beneath it?

    _C. Hun_.                  Friend! have a care,                    100
    Your next step may be fatal!--for the love
    Of Him who made you, stand not on that brink!

    _Man_. (_not hearing him_).
    Such would have been for me a fitting tomb;
    My bones had then been quiet in their depth;
    They had not then been strewn upon the rocks
    For the wind's pastime--as thus--thus they shall be--
    In this one plunge.--Farewell, ye opening Heavens!
    Look not upon me thus reproachfully--
    You were not meant for me--Earth! take these atoms!

         [_As_ MANFRED _is in act to spring from the cliff, the_
      CHAMOIS HUNTER _seizes and retains him with a sudden grasp._

    _C. Hun_. Hold, madman!--though aweary of thy life,                110
    Stain not our pure vales with thy guilty blood:
    Away with me----I will not quit my hold.

    _Man_. I am most sick at heart--nay, grasp me not--
    I am all feebleness--the mountains whirl
    Spinning around me----I grow blind----What art thou?

    _C. Hun_. I'll answer that anon.--Away with me----
    The clouds grow thicker----there--now lean on me--
    Place your foot here--here, take this staff, and cling
    A moment to that shrub--now give me your hand,
    And hold fast by my girdle--softly--well--                         120
    The Chalet will be gained within an hour:
    Come on, we'll quickly find a surer footing,
    And something like a pathway, which the torrent
    Hath washed since winter.--Come,'tis bravely done--
    You should have been a hunter.--Follow me.

           [_As they descend the rocks with difficulty, the scene closes._




                                 ACT II.


             SCENE I.--_A Cottage among the Bernese Alps_.--
                    MANFRED _and the_ CHAMOIS HUNTER.

    _C. Hun_. No--no--yet pause--thou must not yet go forth;
    Thy mind and body are alike unfit
    To trust each other, for some hours, at least;
    When thou art better, I will be thy guide--
    But whither?

    _Man_.       It imports not: I do know
    My route full well, and need no further guidance.

    _C. Hun_. Thy garb and gait bespeak thee of high lineage--
    One of the many chiefs, whose castled crags
    Look o'er the lower valleys--which of these
    May call thee lord? I only know their portals;                      10
    My way of life leads me but rarely down
    To bask by the huge hearths of those old halls,
    Carousing with the vassals; but the paths,
    Which step from out our mountains to their doors,
    I know from childhood--which of these is thine?

    _Man_. No matter.

    _C. Hun_.         Well, Sir, pardon me the question,
    And be of better cheer. Come, taste my wine;
    'Tis of an ancient vintage; many a day
    'T has thawed my veins among our glaciers, now
    Let it do thus for thine--Come, pledge me fairly!                   20

    _Man_. Away, away! there's blood upon the brim!
    Will it then never--never sink in the earth?

    _C. Hun_. What dost thou mean? thy senses wander from thee.

    _Man_. I say 'tis blood--my blood! the pure warm stream
    Which ran in the veins of my fathers, and in ours
    When we were in our youth, and had one heart,
    And loved each other as we should not love,[127]
    And this was shed: but still it rises up,
    Colouring the clouds, that shut me out from Heaven,
    Where thou art not--and I shall never be.                           30

    _C. Hun_. Man of strange words, and some half-maddening sin,[ax]
    Which makes thee people vacancy, whate'er
    Thy dread and sufferance be, there's comfort yet--
    The aid of holy men, and heavenly patience----

    _Man_. Patience--and patience! Hence--that word was made
    For brutes of burthen, not for birds of prey!
    Preach it to mortals of a dust like thine,--
    I am not of thine order.

    _C. Hun_.                Thanks to Heaven!
    I would not be of thine for the free fame
    Of William Tell; but whatsoe'er thine ill,                          40
    It must be borne, and these wild starts are useless.

    _Man_. Do I not bear it?--Look on me--I live.

    _C. Hun._ This is convulsion, and no healthful life.

    _Man_. I tell thee, man! I have lived many years,
    Many long years, but they are nothing now
    To those which I must number: ages--ages--
    Space and eternity--and consciousness,
    With the fierce thirst of death--and still unslaked!

    _C. Hun_. Why on thy brow the seal of middle age
    Hath scarce been set; I am thine elder far.                         50

    _Man_. Think'st thou existence doth depend on time?[128]
    It doth; but actions are our epochs: mine
    Have made my days and nights imperishable,
    Endless, and all alike, as sands on the shore,
    Innumerable atoms; and one desert,
    Barren and cold, on which the wild waves break,
    But nothing rests, save carcasses and wrecks,
    Rocks, and the salt-surf weeds of bitterness.

    _C. Hun_. Alas! he's mad--but yet I must not leave him.

    _Man_. I would I were--for then the things I see                    60
    Would be but a distempered dream.

    _C. Hun_.                         What is it
    That thou dost see, or think thou look'st upon?

    _Man_. Myself, and thee--a peasant of the Alps--
    Thy humble virtues, hospitable home,
    And spirit patient, pious, proud, and free;
    Thy self-respect, grafted on innocent thoughts;
    Thy days of health, and nights of sleep; thy toils,
    By danger dignified, yet guiltless; hopes
    Of cheerful old age and a quiet grave,
    With cross and garland over its green turf,                         70
    And thy grandchildren's love for epitaph!
    This do I see--and then I look within--
    It matters not--my Soul was scorched already!

    _C. Hun_. And would'st thou then exchange thy lot for mine?

    _Man_. No, friend! I would not wrong thee, nor exchange
    My lot with living being: I can bear--
    However wretchedly, 'tis still to bear--
    In life what others could not brook to dream,
    But perish in their slumber.

    _C. Hun_.                    And with this--
    This cautious feeling for another's pain,                           80
    Canst thou be black with evil?--say not so.
    Can one of gentle thoughts have wreaked revenge
    Upon his enemies?

    _Man_.             Oh! no, no, no!
    My injuries came down on those who loved me--
    On those whom I best loved: I never quelled
    An enemy, save in my just defence--
    But my embrace was fatal.

    _C. Hun_.                Heaven give thee rest!
    And Penitence restore thee to thyself;
    My prayers shall be for thee.

    _Man_.                        I need them not,
    But can endure thy pity. I depart--                                 90
    'Tis time--farewell!--Here's gold, and thanks for thee--
    No words--it is thy due.--Follow me not--
    I know my path--the mountain peril's past:
    And once again I charge thee, follow not!
                                                          [_Exit_ MANFRED.


          SCENE II.--_A lower Valley in the Alps.--A Cataract_.

                             _Enter_ MANFRED.

    It is not noon--the Sunbow's rays[129] still arch
    The torrent with the many hues of heaven,
    And roll the sheeted silver's waving column
    O'er the crag's headlong perpendicular,
    And fling its lines of foaming light along,
    And to and fro, like the pale courser's tail,
    The Giant steed, to be bestrode by Death,
    As told in the Apocalypse.[130] No eyes
    But mine now drink this sight of loveliness;
    I should be sole in this sweet solitude,                            10
    And with the Spirit of the place divide
    The homage of these waters.--I will call her.

                 [MANFRED _takes some of the water into the palm of his
                 hand and flings it into the air, muttering the ajuration.
                 After a pause, the_ WITCH OF THE ALPS _rises beneath
                 the arch of the sunbow of the torrent._

    Beautiful Spirit! with thy hair of light,
    And dazzling eyes of glory, in whose form
    The charms of Earth's least mortal daughters grow
    To an unearthly stature, in an essence
    Of purer elements; while the hues of youth,--
    Carnationed like a sleeping Infant's cheek,
    Rocked by the beating of her mother's heart,
    Or the rose tints, which Summer's twilight leaves                   20
    Upon the lofty Glacier's virgin snow,
    The blush of earth embracing with her Heaven,--
    Tinge thy celestial aspect, and make tame
    The beauties of the Sunbow which bends o'er thee.
    Beautiful Spirit! in thy calm clear brow,
    Wherein is glassed serenity of Soul,[ay]
    Which of itself shows immortality,
    I read that thou wilt pardon to a Son
    Of Earth, whom the abstruser powers permit
    At times to commune with them--if that he                           30
    Avail him of his spells--to call thee thus,
    And gaze on thee a moment.

    _Witch_.                   Son of Earth!
    I know thee, and the Powers which give thee power!
    I know thee for a man of many thoughts,
    And deeds of good and ill, extreme in both,
    Fatal and fated in thy sufferings.
    I have expected this--what would'st thou with me?

    _Man_. To look upon thy beauty--nothing further.
    The face of the earth hath maddened me, and I
    Take refuge in her mysteries, and pierce                            40
    To the abodes of those who govern her--
    But they can nothing aid me. I have sought
    From them what they could not bestow, and now
    I search no further.

    _Witch_.             What could be the quest
    Which is not in the power of the most powerful,
    The rulers of the invisible?

    _Man_.                       A boon;--
    But why should I repeat it? 'twere in vain.

    _Witch_. I know not that; let thy lips utter it.

    _Man_. Well, though it torture me, 'tis but the same;
    My pang shall find a voice. From my youth upwards                   50
    My Spirit walked not with the souls of men,
    Nor looked upon the earth with human eyes;
    The thirst of their ambition was not mine,
    The aim of their existence was not mine;
    My joys--my griefs--my passions--and my powers,
    Made me a stranger; though I wore the form,
    I had no sympathy with breathing flesh,
    Nor midst the Creatures of Clay that girded me
    Was there but One who--but of her anon.
    I said with men, and with the thoughts of men,                      60
    I held but slight communion; but instead,
    My joy was in the wilderness,--to breathe
    The difficult air of the iced mountain's top,[131]
    Where the birds dare not build--nor insect's wing
    Flit o'er the herbless granite; or to plunge
    Into the torrent, and to roll along
    On the swift whirl of the new-breaking wave
    Of river-stream, or Ocean, in their flow.[132]
    In these my early strength exulted; or
    To follow through the night the moving moon,[133]                   70
    The stars and their development; or catch
    The dazzling lightnings till my eyes grew dim;
    Or to look, list'ning, on the scattered leaves,
    While Autumn winds were at their evening song.
    These were my pastimes, and to be alone;
    For if the beings, of whom I was one,--
    Hating to be so,--crossed me in my path,
    I felt myself degraded back to them,
    And was all clay again. And then I dived,
    In my lone wanderings, to the caves of Death,                       80
    Searching its cause in its effect; and drew
    From withered bones, and skulls, and heaped up dust
    Conclusions most forbidden.[134] Then I passed--
    The nights of years in sciences untaught,
    Save in the old-time; and with time and toil,
    And terrible ordeal, and such penance
    As in itself hath power upon the air,
    And spirits that do compass air and earth,
    Space, and the peopled Infinite, I made
    Mine eyes familiar with Eternity,                                   90
    Such as, before me, did the Magi, and
    He who from out their fountain-dwellings raised
    Eros and Anteros,[135] at Gadara,
    As I do thee;--and with my knowledge grew
    The thirst of knowledge, and the power and joy
    Of this most bright intelligence, until----

    _Witch_. Proceed.

    _Man_.            Oh! I but thus prolonged my words,
    Boasting these idle attributes, because
    As I approach the core of my heart's grief--
    But--to my task. I have not named to thee                          100
    Father or mother, mistress, friend, or being,
    With whom I wore the chain of human ties;
    If I had such, they seemed not such to me--
    Yet there was One----

    _Witch_.                Spare not thyself--proceed.

    _Man_. She was like me in lineaments--her eyes--
    Her hair--her features--all, to the very tone
    Even of her voice, they said were like to mine;
    But softened all, and tempered into beauty:
    She had the same lone thoughts and wanderings,
    The quest of hidden knowledge, and a mind                          110
    To comprehend the Universe: nor these
    Alone, but with them gentler powers than mine,
    Pity, and smiles, and tears--which I had not;
    And tenderness--but that I had for her;
    Humility--and that I never had.
    Her faults were mine--her virtues were her own--
    I loved her, and destroyed her!

    _Witch_.                          With thy hand?

    _Man_. Not with my hand, but heart, which broke her heart;
    It gazed on mine, and withered. I have shed
    Blood, but not hers--and yet her blood was shed;                   120
    I saw--and could not stanch it.

    _Witch_.                         And for this--
    A being of the race thou dost despise--
    The order, which thine own would rise above,
    Mingling with us and ours,--thou dost forego
    The gifts of our great knowledge, and shrink'st back
    To recreant mortality----Away!

    _Man_. Daughter of Air! I tell thee, since that hour--
    But words are breath--look on me in my sleep,
    Or watch my watchings--Come and sit by me!
    My solitude is solitude no more,                                   130
    But peopled with the Furies;--I have gnashed
    My teeth in darkness till returning morn,
    Then cursed myself till sunset;--I have prayed
    For madness as a blessing--'tis denied me.
    I have affronted Death--but in the war
    Of elements the waters shrunk from me,[136]
    And fatal things passed harmless; the cold hand
    Of an all-pitiless Demon held me back,
    Back by a single hair, which would not break.
    In Fantasy, Imagination, all                                       140
    The affluence of my soul--which one day was
    A Croesus in creation--I plunged deep,
    But, like an ebbing wave, it dashed me back
    Into the gulf of my unfathomed thought.
    I plunged amidst Mankind--Forgetfulness[137]
    I sought in all, save where 'tis to be found--
    And that I have to learn--my Sciences,
    My long pursued and superhuman art,
    Is mortal here: I dwell in my despair--
    And live--and live for ever.[az]

    _Witch_.                     It may be                            150
    That I can aid thee.

    _Man_.               To do this thy power
    Must wake the dead, or lay me low with them.
    Do so--in any shape--in any hour--
    With any torture--so it be the last.

    _Witch_. That is not in my province; but if thou
    Wilt swear obedience to my will, and do
    My bidding, it may help thee to thy wishes.

    _Man_. I will not swear--Obey! and whom? the Spirits
    Whose presence I command, and be the slave
    Of those who served me--Never!

    _Witch_.                       Is this all?                        160
    Hast thou no gentler answer?--Yet bethink thee,
    And pause ere thou rejectest.

    _Man_.                       I have said it.

    _Witch_. Enough! I may retire then--say!

    _Man_. (_alone_). We are the fools of Time and Terror: Days
    Steal on us, and steal from us; yet we live,
    Loathing our life, and dreading still to die.
    In all the days of this detested yoke--
    This vital weight upon the struggling heart,
    Which sinks with sorrow, or beats quick with pain,
    Or joy that ends in agony or faintness--                           170
    In all the days of past and future--for
    In life there is no present--we can number
    How few--how less than few--wherein the soul
    Forbears to pant for death, and yet draws back
    As from a stream in winter, though the chill[ba]
    Be but a moment's. I have one resource
    Still in my science--I can call the dead,
    And ask them what it is we dread to be:
    The sternest answer can but be the Grave,
    And that is nothing: if they answer not--                          180
    The buried Prophet answered to the Hag
    Of Endor; and the Spartan Monarch drew
    From the Byzantine maid's unsleeping spirit
    An answer and his destiny--he slew
    That which he loved, unknowing what he slew,
    And died unpardoned--though he called in aid
    The Phyxian Jove, and in Phigalia roused
    The Arcadian Evocators to compel
    The indignant shadow to depose her wrath,
    Or fix her term of vengeance--she replied                          190
    In words of dubious import, but fulfilled.[138]
    If I had never lived, that which I love
    Had still been living; had I never loved,
    That which I love would still be beautiful,
    Happy and giving happiness. What is she?
    What is she now?--a sufferer for my sins--
    A thing I dare not think upon--or nothing.
    Within few hours I shall not call in vain--
    Yet in this hour I dread the thing I dare:
    Until this hour I never shrunk to gaze                             200
    On spirit, good or evil--now I tremble,
    And feel a strange cold thaw upon my heart.
    But I can act even what I most abhor,
    And champion human fears.--The night approaches.

                          _Enter_ FIRST DESTINY.

    The Moon is rising broad, and round, and bright;
    And here on snows, where never human foot[139]
    Of common mortal trod, we nightly tread,
    And leave no traces: o'er the savage sea,
    The glassy ocean of the mountain ice,
    We skim its rugged breakers, which put on
    The aspect of a tumbling tempest's foam,
    Frozen in a moment[140]--a dead Whirlpool's image:
    And this most steep fantastic pinnacle,
    The fretwork of some earthquake--where the clouds                   10
    Pause to repose themselves in passing by--
    Is sacred to our revels, or our vigils;
    Here do I wait my sisters, on our way
    To the Hall of Arimanes--for to-night
    Is our great festival[141]--'tis strange they come not.

              The Captive Usurper,
                Hurled down from the throne,
              Lay buried in torpor,
                Forgotten and lone;
              I broke through his slumbers,                             20
                I shivered his chain,
              I leagued him with numbers--
                He's Tyrant again!
    With the blood of a million he'll answer my care,
    With a Nation's destruction--his flight and despair![142]


                         _Second Voice, without._

    The Ship sailed on, the Ship sailed fast,
    But I left not a sail, and I left not a mast;
    There is not a plank of the hull or the deck,
    And there is not a wretch to lament o'er his wreck;
    Save one, whom I held, as he swam, by the hair,                     30
    And he was a subject well worthy my care;
    A traitor on land, and a pirate at sea--[143]
    But I saved him to wreak further havoc for me!

          The City lies sleeping;
            The morn, to deplore it,
          May dawn on it weeping:
            Sullenly, slowly,
          The black plague flew o'er it--
            Thousands lie lowly;
          Tens of thousands shall perish;                               40
            The living shall fly from
          The sick they should cherish;
            But nothing can vanquish
          The touch that they die from.
            Sorrow and anguish,
          And evil and dread,
            Envelope a nation;
          The blest are the dead,

            Of their own desolation;                                    50
          This work of a night--
    This wreck of a realm--this deed of my doing--
    For ages I've done, and shall still be renewing!

                               _The Three._

    My Sisters and thyself are slow to-night.

    _Nem_. I was detained repairing shattered thrones--
    Marrying fools, restoring dynasties--
    Avenging men upon their enemies,
    And making them repent their own revenge;
    Goading the wise to madness; from the dull
    Shaping out oracles to rule the world
    Afresh--for they were waxing out of date,
    And mortals dared to ponder for themselves,
    To weigh kings in the balance--and to speak                         70
    Of Freedom, the forbidden fruit.--Away!
    We have outstayed the hour--mount we our clouds!

    Hail to our Master!--Prince of Earth and Air!
      Who walks the clouds and waters--in his hand
    The sceptre of the Elements, which tear
      Themselves to chaos at his high command!
    He breatheth--and a tempest shakes the sea;
      He speaketh--and the clouds reply in thunder;
    He gazeth--from his glance the sunbeams flee;
      He moveth--Earthquakes rend the world asunder.
    Beneath his footsteps the Volcanoes rise;
      His shadow is the Pestilence: his path                            10
    The comets herald through the crackling skies;[bb]
      And Planets turn to ashes at his wrath.
    To him War offers daily sacrifice;
      To him Death pays his tribute; Life is his,
    With all its Infinite of agonies--
      And his the Spirit of whatever is!

                   _Enter the_ DESTINIES _and_ NEMESIS.

    _First Des_. Glory to Arimanes! on the earth
    His power increaseth--both my sisters did
    His bidding, nor did I neglect my duty!

    _Second Des_. Glory to Arimanes! we who bow                         20
    The necks of men, bow down before his throne!

    _Third Des_. Glory to Arimanes! we await
    His nod!

    _Nem_.    Sovereign of Sovereigns! we are thine,
    And all that liveth, more or less, is ours,
    And most things wholly so; still to increase
    Our power, increasing thine, demands our care,
    And we are vigilant. Thy late commands
    Have been fulfilled to the utmost.

                             _Enter_ MANFRED.

    _A Spirit_.                         What is here?
    A mortal!--Thou most rash and fatal wretch,
    Bow down and worship!

    _Second Spirit_.              I do know the man--                   30
    A Magian of great power, and fearful skill!

    _Third Spirit_. Bow down and worship, slave!--What, know'st thou not
    Thine and our Sovereign?--Tremble, and obey!

    _All the Spirits_. Prostrate thyself, and thy condemnéd clay,
    Child of the Earth! or dread the worst.

    _Man_.                                   I know it;
    And yet ye see I kneel not.

    _Fourth Spirit_.             'Twill be taught thee.

    _Man_. 'Tis taught already;--many a night on the earth,
    On the bare ground, have I bowed down my face,
    And strewed my head with ashes; I have known
    The fulness of humiliation--for                                     40
    I sunk before my vain despair, and knelt
    To my own desolation.

    _Fifth Spirit_.         Dost thou dare
    Refuse to Arimanes on his throne
    What the whole earth accords, beholding not
    The terror of his Glory?--Crouch! I say.

    _Man_. Bid _him_ bow down to that which is above him,
    The overruling Infinite--the Maker
    Who made him not for worship--let him kneel,
    And we will kneel together.

    _The Spirits_.               Crush the worm!
    Tear him in pieces!--

    _First Des_.            Hence! Avaunt!--he's mine.                  50
    Prince of the Powers invisible! This man
    Is of no common order, as his port
    And presence here denote: his sufferings
    Have been of an immortal nature--like
    Our own; his knowledge, and his powers and will,
    As far as is compatible with clay,
    Which clogs the ethereal essence, have been such
    As clay hath seldom borne; his aspirations
    Have been beyond the dwellers of the earth,
    And they have only taught him what we know--                        60
    That knowledge is not happiness, and science[146]
    But an exchange of ignorance for that
    Which is another kind of ignorance.
    This is not all--the passions, attributes
    Of Earth and Heaven, from which no power, nor being,
    Nor breath from the worm upwards is exempt,
    Have pierced his heart; and in their consequence
    Made him a thing--which--I who pity not,
    Yet pardon those who pity. He is mine--
    And thine it may be; be it so, or not--                             70
    No other Spirit in this region hath
    A soul like his--or power upon his soul.

    _Nem_. What doth he here then?

    _First Des_.                   Let _him_ answer that.

    _Man_. Ye know what I have known; and without power
    I could not be amongst ye: but there are
    Powers deeper still beyond--I come in quest
    Of such, to answer unto what I seek.

    _Nem_. What would'st thou?

    _Man_.                     _Thou_ canst not reply to me.
    Call up the dead--my question is for them.

    _Nem_. Great Arimanes, doth thy will avouch                         80
    The wishes of this mortal?

    _Ari_.                       Yea.

    _Nem_.                            Whom wouldst thou
    Uncharnel?

    _Man_.      One without a tomb--call up
    Astarte.[147]

                The whole or a part
              Of the form of thy birth,
                Of the mould of thy clay,
              Which returned to the earth,                              90
                Re-appear to the day!
              Bear what thou borest,
                The heart and the form,
              And the aspect thou worest
                Redeem from the worm.
            Appear!--Appear!--Appear!
            Who sent thee there requires thee here!

                [_The Phantom of_ ASTARTE _rises and stands in the midst_.

    _Man_. Can this be death? there's bloom upon her cheek;
    But now I see it is no living hue,
    But a strange hectic--like the unnatural red                       100
    Which Autumn plants upon the perished leaf.[148]
    It is the same! Oh, God! that I should dread
    To look upon the same--Astarte!--No,
    I cannot speak to her--but bid her speak--
    Forgive me or condemn me.

            By the Power which hath broken
              The grave which enthralled thee,
            Speak to him who hath spoken.
              Or those who have called thee!

    _Man_.                      She is silent,
    And in that silence I am more than answered.                       110

    _Nem_. My power extends no further. Prince of Air!
    It rests with thee alone--command her voice.

    _Ari_. Spirit--obey this sceptre!

    _Nem_.                            Silent still!
    She is not of our order, but belongs
    To the other powers. Mortal! thy quest is vain,
    And we are baffled also.

    _Man_.                  Hear me, hear me--
    Astarte! my belovéd! speak to me:
    I have so much endured--so much endure--
    Look on me! the grave hath not changed thee more
    Than I am changed for thee. Thou lovedst me                        120
    Too much, as I loved thee: we were not made
    To torture thus each other--though it were
    The deadliest sin to love as we have loved.
    Say that thou loath'st me not--that I do bear
    This punishment for both--that thou wilt be
    One of the blesséd--and that I shall die;
    For hitherto all hateful things conspire
    To bind me in existence--in a life
    Which makes me shrink from Immortality--
    A future like the past. I cannot rest.                             130
    I know not what I ask, nor what I seek:
    I feel but what thou art, and what I am;
    And I would hear yet once before I perish
    The voice which was my music--Speak to me!
    For I have called on thee in the still night,
    Startled the slumbering birds from the hushed boughs,
    And woke the mountain wolves, and made the caves
    Acquainted with thy vainly echoed name,
    Which answered me--many things answered me--
    Spirits and men--but thou wert silent all.                         140
    Yet speak to me! I have outwatched the stars,
    And gazed o'er heaven in vain in search of thee.
    Speak to me! I have wandered o'er the earth,
    And never found thy likeness--Speak to me!
    Look on the fiends around--they feel for me:
    I fear them not, and feel for thee alone.
    Speak to me! though it be in wrath;--but say--
    I reck not what--but let me hear thee once--
    This once--once more!

    _Phantom of Astarte_.   Manfred!

    _Man_.                           Say on, say on--
    I live but in the sound--it is thy voice!                          150

    _Phan_. Manfred! To-morrow ends thine earthly ills.
    Farewell!

    _Man_.    Yet one word more--am I forgiven?

    _Phan_. Farewell!

    _Man_.            Say, shall we meet again?

    _Phan_.                                    Farewell!

    _Man_. One word for mercy! Say thou lovest me.

    _Phan_. Manfred!

    Her words will be fulfilled. Return to the earth.

    And seek the things beyond mortality.

    _Man_. What is the hour?

    _Her_.                   It wants but one till sunset,
    And promises a lovely twilight.

    _Man_.                          Say,
    Are all things so disposed of in the tower
    As I directed?

    _Her_.        All, my Lord, are ready:
    Here is the key and casket.[151]

    _Man_.                        It is well:
    Thou mayst retire.                                     [_Exit_ HERMAN.

    _Man_. (_alone_).     There is a calm upon me--
    Inexplicable stillness! which till now
    Did not belong to what I knew of life.
    If that I did not know Philosophy
    To be of all our vanities the motliest,                             10
    The merest word that ever fooled the ear
    From out the schoolman's jargon, I should deem
    The golden secret, the sought "Kalon," found,[152]
    And seated in my soul. It will not last,
    But it is well to have known it, though but once:
    It hath enlarged my thoughts with a new sense,
    And I within my tablets would note down
    That there is such a feeling. Who is there?

                            _Re-enter_ HERMAN.

    _Her_. My Lord, the Abbot of St. Maurice craves[153]
    To greet your presence.

                    _Enter the_ ABBOT OF ST. MAURICE.

    _Abbot_.                 Peace be with Count Manfred!              20

    _Man_. Thanks, holy father! welcome to these walls;
    Thy presence honours them, and blesseth those
    Who dwell within them.

    _Abbot_.              Would it were so, Count!--
    But I would fain confer with thee alone.

    _Man_. Herman, retire.--What would my reverend guest?

    _Abbot_. Thus, without prelude:--Age and zeal--my office--
    And good intent must plead my privilege;
    Our near, though not acquainted neighbourhood,
    May also be my herald. Rumours strange,
    And of unholy nature, are abroad,                                   30
    And busy with thy name--a noble name
    For centuries: may he who bears it now
    Transmit it unimpaired!

    _Man_.                  Proceed,--I listen.

    _Abbot_. 'Tis said thou holdest converse with the things
    Which are forbidden to the search of man;
    That with the dwellers of the dark abodes,
    The many evil and unheavenly spirits
    Which walk the valley of the Shade of Death,
    Thou communest. I know that with mankind,
    Thy fellows in creation, thou dost rarely                           40
    Exchange thy thoughts, and that thy solitude
    Is as an Anchorite's--were it but holy.

    _Man_. And what are they who do avouch these things?

    _Abbot_. My pious brethren--the scaréd peasantry--
    Even thy own vassals--who do look on thee
    With most unquiet eyes. Thy life's in peril!

    _Man_. Take it.

    _Abbot_.        I come to save, and not destroy:
    I would not pry into thy secret soul;
    But if these things be sooth, there still is time
    For penitence and pity: reconcile thee                              50
    With the true church, and through the church to Heaven.

    _Man_. I hear thee. This is my reply--whate'er
    I may have been, or am, doth rest between
    Heaven and myself--I shall not choose a mortal
    To be my mediator--Have I sinned
    Against your ordinances? prove and punish![154]

    _Abbot_. My son! I did not speak of punishment,[155]
    But penitence and pardon;--with thyself
    The choice of such remains--and for the last,
    Our institutions and our strong belief                              60
    Have given me power to smooth the path from sin
    To higher hope and better thoughts; the first
    I leave to Heaven,--"Vengeance is mine alone!"
    So saith the Lord, and with all humbleness
    His servant echoes back the awful word.

    _Man_. Old man! there is no power in holy men,
    Nor charm in prayer, nor purifying form
    Of penitence, nor outward look, nor fast,
    Nor agony--nor, greater than all these,
    The innate tortures of that deep Despair,                           70
    Which is Remorse without the fear of Hell,
    But all in all sufficient to itself
    Would make a hell of Heaven--can exorcise
    From out the unbounded spirit the quick sense
    Of its own sins--wrongs--sufferance--and revenge
    Upon itself; there is no future pang
    Can deal that justice on the self--condemned
    He deals on his own soul.

    _Abbot_.                 All this is well;
    For this will pass away, and be succeeded
    By an auspicious hope, which shall look up                          80
    With calm assurafice to that blessed place,
    Which all who seek may win, whatever be
    Their earthly errors, so they be atoned:
    And the commencement of atonement is
    The sense of its necessity. Say on--
    And all our church can teach thee shall be taught;
    And all we can absolve thee shall be pardoned.

    _Man_. When Rome's sixth Emperor[156] was near his last,
    The victim of a self-inflicted wound,
    To shun the torments of a public death[bd]                          90
    From senates once his slaves, a certain soldier,
    With show of loyal pity, would have stanched
    The gushing throat with his officious robe;
    The dying Roman thrust him back, and said--
    Some empire still in his expiring glance--
    "It is too late--is this fidelity?"

    _Abbot_. And what of this?

    _Man_.                     I answer with the Roman--
    "It is too late!"

    _Abbot_.           It never can be so,
    To reconcile thyself with thy own soul,
    And thy own soul with Heaven. Hast thou no hope?                   100
    'Tis strange--even those who do despair above,
    Yet shape themselves some fantasy on earth,
    To which frail twig they cling, like drowning men.

    _Man_. Aye--father! I have had those early visions,
    And noble aspirations in my youth,
    To make my own the mind of other men,
    The enlightener of nations; and to rise
    I knew not whither--it might be to fall;
    But fall, even as the mountain-cataract,
    Which having leapt from its more dazzling height,                  110
    Even in the foaming strength of its abyss,
    (Which casts up misty columns that become
    Clouds raining from the re-ascended skies,)[157]
    Lies low but mighty still.--But this is past,
    My thoughts mistook themselves.

    _Abbot_.                         And wherefore so?

    _Man_.I could not tame my nature down; for he
    Must serve who fain would sway; and soothe, and sue,
    And watch all time, and pry into all place,
    And be a living Lie, who would become
    A mighty thing amongst the mean--and such                          120
    The mass are; I disdained to mingle with
    A herd, though to be leader--and of wolves,
    The lion is alone, and so am I.

    _Abbot_. And why not live and act with other men?

    _Man_. Because my nature was averse from life;
    And yet not cruel; for I would not make,
    But find a desolation. Like the Wind,
    The red-hot breath of the most lone Simoom,[158]
    Which dwells but in the desert, and sweeps o'er
    The barren sands which bear no shrubs to blast,                    130
    And revels o'er their wild and arid waves,
    And seeketh not, so that it is not sought,
    But being met is deadly,--such hath been
    The course of my existence; but there came
    Things in my path which are no more.

    _Abbot_.                             Alas!
    I 'gin to fear that thou art past all aid
    From me and from my calling; yet so young,
    I still would----

    _Man_.              Look on me! there is an order
    Of mortals on the earth, who do become
    Old in their youth, and die ere middle age,[159]                   140
    Without the violence of warlike death;
    Some perishing of pleasure--some of study--
    Some worn with toil, some of mere weariness,--
    Some of disease--and some insanity--
    And some of withered, or of broken hearts;
    For this last is a malady which slays
    More than are numbered in the lists of Fate,
    Taking all shapes, and bearing many names.
    Look upon me! for even of all these things
    Have I partaken; and of all these things,                          150
    One were enough; then wonder not that I
    Am what I am, but that I ever was,
    Or having been, that I am still on earth.

    _Abbot_. Yet, hear me still--

    _Man_.                        Old man! I do respect
    Thine order, and revere thine years; I deem
    Thy purpose pious, but it is in vain:
    Think me not churlish; I would spare thyself,
    Far more than me, in shunning at this time
    All further colloquy--and so--farewell.
                                                            [Exit MANFRED.

    _Abbot_. This should have been a noble creature: he                160
    Hath all the energy which would have made
    A goodly frame of glorious elements,
    Had they been wisely mingled; as it is,
    It is an awful chaos--Light and Darkness--
    And mind and dust--and passions and pure thoughts
    Mixed, and contending without end or order,--
    All dormant or destructive. He will perish--
    And yet he must not--I will try once more,
    For such are worth redemption; and my duty
    Is to dare all things for a righteous end.                         170
    I'll follow him--but cautiously, though surely.
                                                              [Exit ABBOT.


                      SCENE II.--_Another Chamber_.

                          MANFRED _and_ HERMAN.

    _Her_. My lord, you bade me wait on you at sunset:
    He sinks behind the mountain.

    _Man_.                        Doth he so?
    I will look on him.
                            [MANFRED _advances to the Window of the Hall_.
                        Glorious Orb! the idol[160]
    Of early nature, and the vigorous race
    Of undiseased mankind, the giant sons[161]
    Of the embrace of Angels, with a sex
    More beautiful than they, which did draw down
    The erring Spirits who can ne'er return.--
    Most glorious Orb! that wert a worship, ere
    The mystery of thy making was revealed!                             10
    Thou earliest minister of the Almighty,
    Which gladdened, on their mountain tops, the hearts
    Of the Chaldean shepherds, till they poured[162]
    Themselves in orisons! Thou material God!
    And representative of the Unknown--
    Who chose thee for his shadow! Thou chief Star!
    Centre of many stars! which mak'st our earth
    Endurable and temperest the hues
    And hearts of all who walk within thy rays!
    Sire of the seasons! Monarch of the climes,                         20
    And those who dwell in them! for near or far,
    Our inborn spirits have a tint of thee
    Even as our outward aspects;--thou dost rise,
    And shine, and set in glory. Fare thee well!
    I ne'er shall see thee more. As my first glance
    Of love and wonder was for thee, then take
    My latest look: thou wilt not beam on one
    To whom the gifts of life and warmth have been
    Of a more fatal nature. He is gone--
    I follow.                                             [_Exit_ MANFRED.


       SCENE III.--_The Mountains_--_The Castle of Manfred at some
        distance_--_A Terrace before a Tower_.--_Time, Twilight_.

            HERMAN, MANUEL, _and other dependants of_ MANFRED.

    _Her_. 'Tis strange enough! night after night, for years,
    He hath pursued long vigils in this tower,
    Without a witness. I have been within it,--
    So have we all been oft-times; but from it,
    Or its contents, it were impossible
    To draw conclusions absolute, of aught
    His studies tend to. To be sure, there is
    One chamber where none enter: I would give
    The fee of what I have to come these three years,
    To pore upon its mysteries.

    _Manuel_.                  'Twere dangerous;                        10
    Content thyself with what thou know'st already.

    _Her_. Ah! Manuel! thou art elderly and wise,
    And couldst say much; thou hast dwelt within the castle--
    How many years is't?

    _Manuel_.            Ere Count Manfred's birth,
    I served his father, whom he nought resembles.

    _Her_. There be more sons in like predicament!
    But wherein do they differ?

    _Manuel_.                   I speak not
    Of features or of form, but mind and habits;
    Count Sigismund was proud, but gay and free,--
    A warrior and a reveller; he dwelt not                              20
    With books and solitude, nor made the night
    A gloomy vigil, but a festal time,
    Merrier than day; he did not walk the rocks
    And forests like a wolf, nor turn aside
    From men and their delights.

    _Her_.                       Beshrew the hour,
    But those were jocund times! I would that such
    Would visit the old walls again; they look
    As if they had forgotten them.

    _Manuel_.                      These walls
    Must change their chieftain first. Oh! I have seen
    Some strange things in them, Herman.[be]

    _Her_.                               Come, be friendly;             30
    Relate me some to while away our watch:
    I've heard thee darkly speak of an event
    Which happened hereabouts, by this same tower.

    _Manuel_. That was a night indeed! I do remember
    'Twas twilight, as it may be now, and such
    Another evening:--yon red cloud, which rests
    On Eigher's pinnacle,[163] so rested then,--
    So like that it might be the same; the wind
    Was faint and gusty, and the mountain snows
    Began to glitter with the climbing moon;                            40
    Count Manfred was, as now, within his tower,--
    How occupied, we knew not, but with him
    The sole companion of his wanderings
    And watchings--her, whom of all earthly things
    That lived, the only thing he seemed to love,--
    As he, indeed, by blood was bound to do,
    The Lady Astarte, his----[164]
                              Hush! who comes here?

                            _Enter the_ ABBOT.

    _Abbot_. Where is your master?

    _Her_.                          Yonder in the tower.

    _Abbot_. I must speak with him.

    _Manuel_.                       'Tis impossible;
    He is most private, and must not be thus                            50
    Intruded on.

    _Abbot_.      Upon myself I take
    The forfeit of my fault, if fault there be--
    But I must see him.

    _Her_.              Thou hast seen him once
    his eve already.

    _Abbot_.          Herman! I command thee,[bf]
    Knock, and apprize the Count of my approach.

    _Her_. We dare not.

    _Abbot_.            Then it seems I must be herald
    Of my own purpose.

    _Manuel_.          Reverend father, stop--
    I pray you pause.

    _Abbot_.          Why so?

    _Manuel_.                 But step this way,
    And I will tell you further.                                [_Exeunt_.


                   SCENE IV.--_Interior of the Tower_.

                             MANFRED _alone_.

    The stars are forth, the moon above the tops
    Of the snow-shining mountains.--Beautiful!
    I linger yet with Nature, for the Night[165]
    Hath been to me a more familiar face
    Than that of man; and in her starry shade
    Of dim and solitary loveliness,
    I learned the language of another world.
    I do remember me, that in my youth,
    When I was wandering,--upon such a night
    I stood within the Coliseum's wall,[166]                            10
    'Midst the chief relics of almighty Rome;
    The trees which grew along the broken arches
    Waved dark in the blue midnight, and the stars
    Shone through the rents of ruin; from afar
    The watch-dog bayed beyond the Tiber; and
    More near from out the Cæsars' palace came
    The owl's long cry, and, interruptedly,[167]
    Of distant sentinels the fitful song
    Begun and died upon the gentle wind.[168]
    Some cypresses beyond the time-worn breach                          20
    Appeared to skirt the horizon, yet they stood
    Within a bowshot. Where the Cæsars dwelt,
    And dwell the tuneless birds of night, amidst
    A grove which springs through levelled battlements,
    And twines its roots with the imperial hearths,
    Ivy usurps the laurel's place of growth;
    But the gladiators' bloody Circus stands,
    A noble wreck in ruinous perfection,
    While Cæsar's chambers, and the Augustan halls,
    Grovel on earth in indistinct decay.--                              30
    And thou didst shine, thou rolling Moon, upon
    All this, and cast a wide and tender light,
    Which softened down the hoar austerity
    Of rugged desolation, and filled up,
    As 'twere anew, the gaps of centuries;
    Leaving that beautiful which still was so,
    And making that which was not--till the place
    Became religion, and the heart ran o'er
    With silent worship of the Great of old,--
    The dead, but sceptred, Sovereigns, who still rule                  40
    Our spirits from their urns.
                                 'Twas such a night!
    'Tis strange that I recall it at this time;
    But I have found our thoughts take wildest flight
    Even at the moment when they should array
    Themselves in pensive order.

                            _Enter the_ ABBOT.

    _Abbot_.                     My good Lord!
    I crave a second grace for this approach;
    But yet let not my humble zeal offend
    By its abruptness--all it hath of ill
    Recoils on me; its good in the effect
    May light upon your head--could I say _heart_--                      50
    Could I touch _that_, with words or prayers, I should
    Recall a noble spirit which hath wandered,
    But is not yet all lost.

    _Man_.                  Thou know'st me not;
    My days are numbered, and my deeds recorded:
    Retire, or 'twill be dangerous--Away!

    _Abbot_. Thou dost not mean to menace me?

    _Man_.                                   Not I!
    I simply tell thee peril is at hand,
    And would preserve thee.

    _Abbot_.                 What dost thou mean?

    _Man_.                                       Look there!
    What dost thou see?

    _Abbot_.           Nothing.

    _Man_.                      Look there, I say,
    And steadfastly;--now tell me what thou seest?                      60

    _Abbot_. That which should shake me,--but I fear it not:
    I see a dusk and awful figure rise,
    Like an infernal god, from out the earth;
    His face wrapt in a mantle, and his form
    Robed as with angry clouds: he stands between
    Thyself and me--but I do fear him not.

    _Man_. Thou hast no cause--he shall not harm thee--but
    His sight may shock thine old limbs into palsy.
    I say to thee--Retire!

    _Abbot_.              And I reply--

    _Man_.             Why--aye--what doth he here?
    I did not send for him,--he is unbidden.

    _Abbot_. Alas! lost Mortal! what with guests like these
    Hast thou to do? I tremble for thy sake:
    Why doth he gaze on thee, and thou on him?
    Ah! he unveils his aspect: on his brow
    The thunder-scars are graven; from his eye[169]
    Glares forth the immortality of Hell--
    Avaunt!--

    _Man_.        Pronounce--what is thy mission?

    _Spirit_.                                     Come!

    Things of an essence greater far than thine,
    And striven with thy masters. Get thee hence!

    _Spirit_. Mortal! thine hour is come--Away! I say.

    _Man_. I knew, and know my hour is come, but not
    To render up my soul to such as thee:
    Away! I'll die as I have lived--alone.                              90

    Ye have no power where Piety hath power,
    And I do charge ye in the name--

    _Spirit_.                        Old man!
    We know ourselves, our mission, and thine order;
    Waste not thy holy words on idle uses,
    It were in vain: this man is forfeited.
    Once more--I summon him--Away! Away!

    _Man_. I do defy ye,--though I feel my soul
    Is ebbing from me, yet I do defy ye;                               100
    Nor will I hence, while I have earthly breath
    To breathe my scorn upon ye--earthly strength
    To wrestle, though with spirits; what ye take
    Shall be ta'en limb by limb.

    _Spirit_.                    Reluctant mortal!
    Is this the Magian who would so pervade
    The world invisible, and make himself
    Almost our equal? Can it be that thou
    Art thus in love with life? the very life
    Which made thee wretched?

    _Man_.                   Thou false fiend, thou liest!
    My life is in its last hour,--_that_ I know,                       110
    Nor would redeem a moment of that hour;
    I do not combat against Death, but thee
    And thy surrounding angels; my past power
    Was purchased by no compact with thy crew,
    But by superior science--penance, daring,
    And length of watching, strength of mind, and skill
    In knowledge of our Fathers--when the earth
    Saw men and spirits walking side by side,
    And gave ye no supremacy: I stand
    Upon my strength--I do defy--deny--                                120
    Spurn back, and scorn ye!--

    _Spirit_.                 But thy many crimes
    Have made thee--

    _Man_.          What are they to such as thee?
    Must crimes be punished but by other crimes,
    And greater criminals?--Back to thy hell!
    Thou hast no power upon me, _that_ I feel;
    Thou never shalt possess me, _that_ I know:
    What I have done is done; I bear within
    A torture which could nothing gain from thine:
    The Mind which is immortal makes itself
    Requital for its good or evil thoughts,--                          130
    Is its own origin of ill and end--
    And its own place and time:[170] its innate sense,
    When stripped of this mortality, derives
    No colour from the fleeting things without,
    But is absorbed in sufferance or in joy,
    Born from the knowledge of its own desert.
    _Thou_ didst not tempt me, and thou couldst not tempt me;
    I have not been thy dupe, nor am thy prey--
    But was my own destroyer, and will be
    My own hereafter.--Back, ye baffled fiends!                        140
    The hand of Death is on me--but not yours!

    _Abbot_. Alas! how pale thou art--thy lips are white--
    And thy breast heaves--and in thy gasping throat
    The accents rattle: Give thy prayers to Heaven--
    Pray--albeit but in thought,--but die not thus.

    _Man_. 'Tis over--my dull eyes can fix thee not;
    But all things swim around me, and the earth
    Heaves as it were beneath me. Fare thee well--
    Give me thy hand.

    _Abbot_.            Cold--cold--even to the heart--
    But yet one prayer--Alas! how fares it with thee?                  150

    _Man_. Old man! 'tis not so difficult to die.[171]

[121] [The germs of this and of several other passages in _Manfred_ may
be found, as Lord Byron stated, in the Journal of his Swiss tour, which
he transmitted to his sister. "Sept. 19, 1816.--Arrived at a lake in the
very nipple of the bosom of the Mountain; left our quadrupeds with a
Shepherd, and ascended further; came to some snow in patches, upon which
my forehead's perspiration fell like rain, making the same dints as in a
sieve; the chill of the wind and the snow turned me giddy, but I
scrambled on and upwards. Hobhouse went to the highest _pinnacle._ ...
The whole of the Mountain superb. A Shepherd on a very steep and high
cliff playing upon his _pipe_; very different from _Arcadia,_ (where I
saw the pastors with a long Musquet instead of a Crook, and pistols in
their Girdles).... The music of the Cows' bells (for their wealth, like
the Patriarchs', is cattle) in the pastures, (which reach to a height
far above any mountains in Britain), and the Shepherds' shouting to us
from crag to crag, and playing on their reeds where the steeps appeared
almost inaccessible, with the surrounding scenery, realized all that I
have ever heard or imagined of a pastoral existence:--much more so than
Greece or Asia Minor, for there we are a little too much of the sabre
and musquet order; and if there is a Crook in one hand, you are sure to
see a gun in the other:--but this was pure and unmixed--solitary,
savage, and patriarchal.... As we went, they played the 'Ranz des
Vaches' and other airs, by way of farewell. I have lately repeopled my
mind with Nature" (_Letters_, 1899, in. 354, 355).]

appearance. The side we ascended was (of course) not of so precipitous a
nature; but on arriving at the summit, we looked down the other side
upon a boiling sea of cloud, dashing against the crags on which we stood
(these crags on one side quite perpendicular) ... In passing the masses
of snow, I made a snowball and pelted Hobhouse with it" (_ibid_, pp.

[126] [The fall of the Rossberg took place September 2, 1806. "A huge
mass of conglomerate rock, 1000 feet broad and 100 feet thick, detached
itself from the face of the mountain (Rossberg or Rufiberg, near Goldau,
south of Lake Zug), and slipped down into the valley below, overwhelming
the villages of Goldau, Busingen, and Rothen, and part of Lowertz. More
than four hundred and fifty human beings perished, and whole herds of
cattle were swept away. Five minutes sufficed to complete the work of
destruction. The inhabitants were first roused by a loud and grating
sound like thunder ... and beheld the valleys shrouded in a cloud of
dust; when it had cleared away they found the face of nature
changed."--_Handbook of Switzerland,_ Part 1. pp 58, 59.]

[127] {99}[The critics of the day either affected to ignore or severely
censured (e.g. writers in the _Critical_, _European_, and _Gentleman's_
Magazines) the allusions to an incestuous passion between Manfred and
Astarte. Shelley, in a letter to Mrs. Gisborne, November 16, 1819,
commenting on Calderon's _Los Cabellos de Absalon,_ discusses the
question from an ethical as well as critical point of view: "The incest
scene between Amon and Tamar is perfectly tremendous. Well may Calderon
say, in the person of the former--

    Si sangre sin fuego hiere
    Qua fara sangre con fuego.'

Incest is, like many other incorrect things, a very poetical
circumstance. It may be the defiance of everything for the sake of
another which clothes itself in the glory of the highest heroism, or it
may be that cynical rage which, confounding the good and the bad in
existing opinions, breaks through them for the purpose of rioting in
selfishness and antipathy."--_Works of P. B. Shelley,_ 1880, iv. 142.]

bathing in the hot baths of Gadara, in Syria, a dispute arising
concerning the baths, he, smiling, ordered his disciples to ask the
inhabitants by what names the two lesser springs, that were fairer than
the rest, were called. To which the inhabitants replied, that 'the one
was called Love, and the other Love's Contrary, but for what reason they
knew not.' Upon which Iamblichus, who chanced to be sitting on the
fountain's edge where the stream flowed out, put his hand on the water,
and, having uttered a few words, called up from the depths of the
fountain a fair-skinned lad, not over-tall, whose golden locks fell in
sunny curls over his breast and back, so that he looked like one fresh
from the bath; and then, going to the other spring, and doing as he had
done before, called up another Amoretto like the first, save that his
long-flowing locks now seemed black, now shot with sunny gleams.
Whereupon both the Amoretti nestled and clung round Iamblichus as if
they had been his own children ... after this his disciples asked him no
more questions."--Eunapii Sardiani _Vitæ Philosophorum et Sophistarum_

[138] The story of Pausanias, king of Sparta, (who commanded the Greeks
at the battle of Platea, and afterwards perished for an attempt to
betray the Lacedæmonians), and Cleonice, is told in Plutarch's life of
Cimon; and in the Laconics of Pausanias the sophist in his description
of Greece.

[The following is the passage from Plutarch: "It is related that when
Pausanias was at Byzantium, he cast his eyes upon a young virgin named
Cleonice, of a noble family there, and insisted on having her for a
mistress. The parents, intimidated by his power, were under the hard
necessity of giving up their daughter. The young woman begged that the
light might be taken out of his apartment, that she might go to his bed
in secresy and silence. When she entered he was asleep, and she
unfortunately stumbled upon the candlestick, and threw it down. The
noise waked him suddenly, and he, in his confusion, thinking it was an
enemy coming to assassinate him, unsheathed a dagger that lay by him,
and plunged it into the virgin's heart. After this he could never rest.
Her image appeared to him every night, and with a menacing tone repeated
this heroic verse--

    'Go to the fate which pride and lust prepare!'

The allies, highly incensed at this infamous action, joined Cimon to
besiege him in Byzantium. But he found means to escape thence; and, as
he was still haunted by the spectre, he is said to have applied to a
temple at Heraclea, where the _manes_ of the dead were consulted. There
he invoked the spirit of Cleonice, and entreated her pardon. She
appeared, and told him 'he would soon be delivered from all his
troubles, after his return to Sparta:' in which, it seems, his death was
enigmatically foretold." "Thus," adds the translator in a note, "we find
that it was a custom in the pagan as well as in the Hebrew theology to
conjure up the spirits of the dead, and that the witch of Endor was not
the only witch in the world."--Langhorne's _Plutarch_, 1838, p. 339.

The same story is told in the _Periegesis Græcæ_, lib. iii. cap. xvii.,
but Pausanias adds, "This was the deed from the guilt of which Pausanias
could never fly, though he employed all-various purifications, received
the deprecations of Jupiter Phyxius, and went to Phigalea to the
Arcadian evocators of souls."--_Descr. of Greece_ (translated by T.
Taylor), 1794, i. 304, 305.]

[139] {109}[Compare--

    "But I have seen the soaring Jungfrau rear
    Her never-trodden snow."

                     _Childe Harold_, Canto IV. stanza lxxiii. lines 6, 7.

Byron did not know, or ignored, the fact that the Jungfrau was first
ascended in 1811, by the brothers Meyer, of Aarau.]

[140] {110}[Compare--

    "And who commanded (and the silence came)
    Here let the billows stiffen and have rest?

    Motionless torrents! silent cataracts."

         _Hymn before Sunrise, etc.,_ by S.T. Coleridge, lines 47, 48, 53.

"Arrived at the Grindenwald; dined, mounted again, and rode to the
higher Glacier--twilight, but distinct--very fine Glacier, like _a
frozen hurricane_" (Letters, 1899, iii. 360).]

    Tyrants shall believe and tremble--

Compare, too, _Napoleon's Farewell_, stanza 3, ibid., p. 428. The
"Voice" prophesies that St. Helena will prove a second Elba, and that
Napoleon will "live to fight another day."]

[143] {111}[Byron may have had in his mind Thomas Lord Cochrane
(1775-1860), "who had done brilliant service in his successive
commands--the _Speedy_, _Pallas_, _Impérieuse_, and the flotilla of
fire-ships at Basque Roads in 1809." In his Diary, March 10, 1814, he
speaks of him as "the stock-jobbing hoaxer" (_Letters_, 1898, ii. 396,
note 1).]

[144] {112}[Arimanes, the Aherman of _Vathek_, the Arimanius of Greek
and Latin writers, is the Ahriman (or Angra Mainyu, "who is all death,"
the spirit of evil, the counter-creator) of the _Zend-Avesta_,
"Fargard," i. 5 (translated by James Darmesteter, 1895, p. 4). Byron may
have got the form Arimanius (_vide_ Steph., _Thesaurus_) from
D'Herbelot, and changed it to Arimanes.]

Cicero says that she was married to Adonis, alluding, no doubt, to the
myth of the Phoenician Astoreth, who was at once the bride and mother of
Tammuz or Adonis.]

[150] {119}[On September 22, 1816 (_Letters_, 1899, iii. 357, note 2),
Byron rode from Neuhaus, at the Interlaken end of Lake Thun, to the
Staubbach. On the way between Matten and Müllinen, not far from the
village of Wilderswyl, he passed the baronial Castle of Unspunnen, the
traditional castle of Manfred. It is "but a square tower, with flanking
round turrets, rising picturesquely above the surrounding brushwood." On
the same day and near the same spot he "passed a rock; inscription--two
brothers--one murdered the other; just the place for it." Here,
according to the Countess Guiccioli, was "the origin of _Manfred_." It
is somewhat singular that, on the appearance of _Manfred_, a paper was
published in the June number of the _Edinburgh Monthly Magazine_, 1817,
vol. i. pp. 270-273, entitled, "Sketch of a Tradition related by a Monk
in Switzerland." The narrator, who signs himself P. F., professes to
have heard the story in the autumn of 1816 from one of the fathers "of
Capuchin Friars, not far from Altorf." It is the story of the love of
two brothers for a lady with whom they had "passed their infancy." She
becomes the wife of the elder brother, and, later, inspires the younger
brother with a passion against which he struggles in vain. The fate of
the elder brother is shrouded in mystery. The lady wastes away, and her
paramour is found dead "in the same pass in which he had met his sister
among the mountains." The excuse for retelling the story is that there
appeared to be "a striking coincidence in some characteristic features
between Lord Byron's drama and the Swiss tradition."]

[151] [The "revised version" makes no further mention of the "key and
casket;" but in the first draft (_vide infra_, p. 122) they were used by
Manfred in calling up Astaroth (_Selections from Byron_, New York, 1900,
p. 370).]

[152] {120}[Byron may have had in his mind a sentence in a letter of C.
Cassius to Cicero (_Epist.,_ xv. 19), in which he says, "It is difficult
to persuade men that goodness is desirable for its own sake (τὸ καλὸν δἰ
αὐτὸ αἱρετὸν [Greek: to\ kalo\n di) au)to\ ai(reto\n]); and yet it is
true, and may be proved, that pleasure and calm are won by virtue,
justice, in a word by goodness (τῷ καλῷ [Greek: tô~| kalô~|])."]

[153] St. Maurice is in the Rhone valley, some sixteen miles from
Villeneuve. The abbey (now occupied by Augustinian monks) was founded in
the fourth century, and endowed by Sigismund, King of Burgundy.

[154] {121}[Thus far the text stands as originally written. The rest of
the scene as given in the first MS. is as follows:--

    _Abbot_. Then, hear and tremble! For the headstrong wretch
    Who in the mail of innate hardihood
    Would shield himself, and battle for his sins,
    There is the stake on earth--and beyond earth
    Eternal--

    _Man_.   Charity, most reverend father,
    Becomes thy lips so much more than this menace,
    That I would call thee back to it: but say,
    What would'st thou with me?

    _Abbot_.                   It may be there are
    Things that would shake thee--but I keep them back,
    And give thee till to-morrow to repent.                             10
    Then if thou dost not all devote thyself
    To penance, and with gift of all thy lands
    To the Monastery----

    _Man_.               I understand thee,--well!

    _Abbot_. Expect no mercy; I have warned thee.

    _Man_. (_opening the casket_). Stop--
    There is a gift for thee within this casket.
                         [MANFRED _opens the casket, strikes a light, and
                             burns some incense._
    Ho! Ashtaroth!

          _The_ DEMON ASHTAROTH _appears, singing as follows:--_

          The raven sits
           On the Raven-stone,[*]
          And his black wing flits
            O'er the milk--white bone;                                  20
          To and fro, as the night--winds blow,
            The carcass of the assassin swings;
          And there alone, on the Raven-stone,
            The raven flaps his dusky wings.

          The fetters creak--and his ebon beak
            Croaks to the close of the hollow sound;
          And this is the tune, by the light of the Moon,
            To which the Witches dance their round--
          Merrily--merrily--cheerily--cheerily--
            Merrily--merrily--speeds the ball:                          30
          The dead in their shrouds, and the Demons in clouds,
            Flock to the Witches' Carnival.

    _Abbot_. I fear thee not--hence--hence--
    Avaunt thee, evil One!--help, ho! without there!

    _Man_. Convey this man to the Shreckhorn--to its peak--
    To its extremest peak--watch with him there
    From now till sunrise; let him gaze, and know
    He ne'er again will be so near to Heaven.
    But harm him not; and, when the morrow breaks,
    Set him down safe in his cell--away with him!                       40

    _Ash_. Had I not better bring his brethren too,
    Convent and all, to bear him company?

    _Man_. No, this will serve for the present. Take him up.

    _Ash_. Come, Friar! now an exorcism or two,
    And we shall fly the lighter.

      ASHTAROTH _disappears with the_ ABBOT, _singing as follows:_--

    A prodigal son, and a maid undone,[§]
      And a widow re-wedded within the year;
    And a worldly monk, and a pregnant nun,
      Are things which every day appear.

                             MANFRED _alone._

    _Man_. Why would this fool break in on me, and force                50
    My art to pranks fantastical?--no matter,
    It was not of my seeking. My heart sickens,
    And weighs a fixed foreboding on my soul.
    But it is calm--calm as a sullen sea
    After the hurricane; the winds are still,
    But the cold waves swell high and heavily,
    And there is danger in them. Such a rest
    Is no repose. My life hath been a combat,
    And every thought a wound, till I am scarred
    In the immortal part of me.--What now?]                             60

                  INTRODUCTION TO _THE LAMENT OF TASSO_.


The MS. of the _Lament of Tasso_ is dated April 20, 1817. It was
despatched from Florence April 23, and reached England May 12 (see
_Memoir of John Murray_, 1891, i. 384). Proofs reached Byron June 7, and
the poem was published July 17, 1817.

"It was," he writes (April 26), "written in consequence of my having
been lately in Ferrara." Again, writing from Rome (May 5, 1817), he asks
if the MS. has arrived, and adds, "I look upon it as a 'These be good
rhymes,' as Pope's papa said to him when he was a boy" (_Letters_, 1900,
iv. 112-115). Two months later he reverted to the theme of Tasso's
ill-treatment at the hands of Duke Alphonso, in the memorable stanzas
xxxv.-xxxix. of the Fourth Canto of _Childe Harold_ (_Poetical Works_,
1899, ii. 354-359; and for examination of the circumstances of Tasso's
imprisonment in the Hospital of Sant' Anna, _vide ibid._, pp. 355, 356,
note 1).

Notices of the _Lament of Tasso_ appeared in the _Gentleman's Magazine_,
August, 1817, vol. 87, pp. 150, 151; in _The Scot's Magazine_, August,
1817, N.S., vol. i. pp. 48, 49; and a eulogistic but uncritical review
in _Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine_, November, 1817, vol. ii. pp.
142-144.

At Ferrara, in the Library, are preserved the original MSS. of Tasso's
Gierusalemme[173] and of Guarini's Pastor Fido, with letters of Tasso,
one from Titian to Ariosto, and the inkstand and chair, the tomb and the
house, of the latter. But, as misfortune has a greater interest for
posterity, and little or none for the cotemporary, the cell where Tasso
was confined in the hospital of St. Anna attracts a more fixed attention
than the residence or the monument of Ariosto--at least it had this
effect on me. There are two inscriptions, one on the outer gate, the
second over the cell itself, inviting, unnecessarily, the wonder and the
indignation of the spectator. Ferrara is much decayed and depopulated:
the castle still exists entire; and I saw the court where Parisina and
Hugo were beheaded, according to the annal of Gibbon.[174]





                        THE LAMENT OF TASSO.[175]

                        I.

    Long years!--It tries the thrilling frame to bear
    And eagle-spirit of a Child of Song--
    Long years of outrage--calumny--and wrong;
    Imputed madness, prisoned solitude,[176]
    And the Mind's canker in its savage mood,
    When the impatient thirst of light and air
    Parches the heart; and the abhorred grate,
    Marring the sunbeams with its hideous shade,
    Works through the throbbing eyeball to the brain,
    With a hot sense of heaviness and pain;                             10
    And bare, at once, Captivity displayed
    Stands scoffing through the never-opened gate,
    Which nothing through its bars admits, save day,
    And tasteless food, which I have eat alone
    Till its unsocial bitterness is gone;
    And I can banquet like a beast of prey,
    Sullen and lonely, couching in the cave
    Which is my lair, and--it may be--my grave.
    All this hath somewhat worn me, and may wear,
    But must be borne. I stoop not to despair;                          20
    For I have battled with mine agony,
    And made me wings wherewith to overfly
    The narrow circus of my dungeon wall,
    And freed the Holy Sepulchre from thrall;
    And revelled among men and things divine,
    And poured my spirit over Palestine,[177]
    In honour of the sacred war for Him,
    The God who was on earth and is in Heaven,
    For He has strengthened me in heart and limb.
    That through this sufferance I might be forgiven,                   30
    I have employed my penance to record
    How Salem's shrine was won, and how adored.

                        II.

    But this is o'er--my pleasant task is done:--[178]
    My long-sustaining Friend of many years!
    If I do blot thy final page with tears,[179]
    Know, that my sorrows have wrung from me none.
    But Thou, my young creation! my Soul's child!
    Which ever playing round me came and smiled,
    And wooed me from myself with thy sweet sight,
    Thou too art gone--and so is my delight:                            40
    And therefore do I weep and inly bleed
    With this last bruise upon a broken reed.
    Thou too art ended--what is left me now?
    For I have anguish yet to bear--and how?
    I know not that--but in the innate force
    Of my own spirit shall be found resource.
    I have not sunk, for I had no remorse,
    Nor cause for such: they called me mad--and why?
    Oh Leonora! wilt not thou reply?[180]
    I was indeed delirious in my heart                                  50
    To lift my love so lofty as thou art;
    But still my frenzy was not of the mind:
    I knew my fault, and feel my punishment
    Not less because I suffer it unbent.
    That thou wert beautiful, and I not blind,
    Hath been the sin which shuts me from mankind;
    But let them go, or torture as they will,
    My heart can multiply thine image still;
    Successful Love may sate itself away;
    The wretched are the faithful; 't is their fate                     60
    To have all feeling, save the one, decay,
    And every passion into one dilate,
    As rapid rivers into Ocean pour;
    But ours is fathomless, and hath no shore.

                        III.

    Above me, hark! the long and maniac cry
    Of minds and bodies in captivity.
    And hark! the lash and the increasing howl,
    And the half-inarticulate blasphemy!
    There be some here with worse than frenzy foul,
    Some who do still goad on the o'er-laboured mind,                   70
    And dim the little light that's left behind
    With needless torture, as their tyrant Will
    Is wound up to the lust of doing ill:[181]
    With these and with their victims am I classed,
    'Mid sounds and sights like these long years have passed;
    'Mid sights and sounds like these my life may close:
    So let it be--for then I shall repose.

                        IV.

    I have been patient, let me be so yet;
    I had forgotten half I would forget,
    But it revives--Oh! would it were my lot                            80
    To be forgetful as I am forgot!--
    Feel I not wroth with those who bade me dwell
    In this vast Lazar-house of many woes?
    Where laughter is not mirth, nor thought the mind,
    Nor words a language, nor ev'n men mankind;
    Where cries reply to curses, shrieks to blows,
    And each is tortured in his separate hell--
    For we are crowded in our solitudes--
    Many, but each divided by the wall,
    Which echoes Madness in her babbling moods;                         90
    While all can hear, none heed his neighbour's call--
    None! save that One, the veriest wretch of all,
    Who was not made to be the mate of these,
    Nor bound between Distraction and Disease.
    Feel I not wroth with those who placed me here?
    Who have debased me in the minds of men,
    Debarring me the usage of my own,
    Blighting my life in best of its career,
    Branding my thoughts as things to shun and fear?
    Would I not pay them back these pangs again,                       100
    And teach them inward Sorrow's stifled groan?
    The struggle to be calm, and cold distress,
    Which undermines our Stoical success?
    No!--still too proud to be vindictive--I
    Have pardoned Princes' insults, and would die.
    Yes, Sister of my Sovereign! for thy sake
    I weed all bitterness from out my breast,
    It hath no business where _thou_ art a guest:
    Thy brother hates--but I can not detest;
    Thou pitiest not--but I can not forsake.                           110

                        V.

    Look on a love which knows not to despair,
    But all unquenched is still my better part,
    Dwelling deep in my shut and silent heart,
    As dwells the gathered lightning in its cloud,
    Encompassed with its dark and rolling shroud,
    Till struck,--forth flies the all-ethereal dart!
    And thus at the collision of thy name
    The vivid thought still flashes through my frame,
    And for a moment all things as they were
    Flit by me;--they are gone--I am the same.                         120
    And yet my love without ambition grew;
    I knew thy state--my station--and I knew
    A Princess was no love-mate for a bard;[182]
    I told it not--I breathed it not[183]--it was
    Sufficient to itself, its own reward;
    And if my eyes revealed it, they, alas!
    Were punished by the silentness of thine,
    And yet I did not venture to repine.
    Thou wert to me a crystal-girded shrine,
    Worshipped at holy distance, and around                            130
    Hallowed and meekly kissed the saintly ground;
    Not for thou wert a Princess, but that Love
    Had robed thee with a glory, and arrayed
    Thy lineaments in beauty that dismayed--
    Oh! not dismayed--but awed, like One above!
    And in that sweet severity[184] there was
    A something which all softness did surpass--
    I know not how--thy Genius mastered mine--
    My Star stood still before thee:--if it were
    Presumptuous thus to love without design,                          140
    That sad fatality hath cost me dear;
    But thou art dearest still, and I should be
    Fit for this cell, which wrongs me--but for _thee_.
    The very love which locked me to my chain
    Hath lightened half its weight; and for the rest,
    Though heavy, lent me vigour to sustain,
    And look to thee with undivided breast,
    And foil the ingenuity of Pain.

                        VI.

    It is no marvel--from my very birth
    My soul was drunk with Love,--which did pervade                    150
    And mingle with whate'er I saw on earth:
    Of objects all inanimate I made
    Idols, and out of wild and lonely flowers,
    And rocks, whereby they grew, a Paradise,
    Where I did lay me down within the shade
    Of waving trees, and dreamed uncounted hours,
    Though I was chid for wandering; and the Wise
    Shook their white agéd heads o'er me, and said
    Of such materials wretched men were made,
    And such a truant boy would end in woe,                            160
    And that the only lesson was a blow;[185]--
    And then they smote me, and I did not weep,
    But cursed them in my heart, and to my haunt
    Returned and wept alone, and dreamed again
    The visions which arise without a sleep.
    And with my years my soul began to pant
    With feelings of strange tumult and soft pain;
    And the whole heart exhaled into One Want,
    But undefined and wandering, till the day
    I found the thing I sought--and that was thee;                     170
    And then I lost my being, all to be
    Absorbed in thine;--the world was past away;--
    _Thou_ didst annihilate the earth to me!


                        VII.

    I loved all Solitude--but little thought
    To spend I know not what of life, remote
    From all communion with existence, save
    The maniac and his tyrant;--had I been
    Their fellow, many years ere this had seen
    My mind like theirs corrupted to its grave.[bh]
    But who hath seen me writhe, or heard me rave?                     180
    Perchance in such a cell we suffer more
    Than the wrecked sailor on his desert shore;
    The world is all before him--_mine_ is _here_,
    Scarce twice the space they must accord my bier.
    What though _he_ perish, he may lift his eye,
    And with a dying glance upbraid the sky;
    I will not raise my own in such reproof,
    Although 'tis clouded by my dungeon roof.

                        VIII.

    Yet do I feel at times my mind decline,[186]
    But with a sense of its decay: I see                               190
    Unwonted lights along my prison shine,
    And a strange Demon,[187] who is vexing me
    With pilfering pranks and petty pains, below
    The feeling of the healthful and the free;
    But much to One, who long hath suffered so,
    Sickness of heart, and narrowness of place,
    And all that may be borne, or can debase.
    I thought mine enemies had been but Man,
    But Spirits may be leagued with them--all Earth
    Abandons--Heaven forgets me;--in the dearth                        200
    Of such defence the Powers of Evil can--
    It may be--tempt me further,--and prevail
    Against the outworn creature they assail.
    Why in this furnace is my spirit proved,
    Like steel in tempering fire? because I loved?
    Because I loved what not to love, and see,
    Was more or less than mortal, and than me.

                        IX.

    I once was quick in feeling--that is o'er;--
    My scars are callous, or I should have dashed
    My brain against these bars, as the sun flashed                    210
    In mockery through them;--- If I bear and bore
    The much I have recounted, and the more
    Which hath no words,--'t is that I would not die
    And sanction with self-slaughter the dull lie
    Which snared me here, and with the brand of shame
    Stamp Madness deep into my memory,
    And woo Compassion to a blighted name,
    Sealing the sentence which my foes proclaim.
    No--it shall be immortal!--and I make
    A future temple of my present cell,                                220
    Which nations yet shall visit for my sake.[bi]
    While thou, Ferrara! when no longer dwell
    The ducal chiefs within thee, shall fall down,
    And crumbling piecemeal view thy hearthless halls,
    A Poet's wreath shall be thine only crown,--
    A Poet's dungeon thy most far renown,
    While strangers wonder o'er thy unpeopled walls!
    And thou, Leonora!--thou--who wert ashamed
    That such as I could love--who blushed to hear
    To less than monarchs that thou couldst be dear,                   230
    Go! tell thy brother, that my heart, untamed
    By grief--years--weariness--and it may be
    A taint of that he would impute to me--
    From long infection of a den like this,
    Where the mind rots congenial with the abyss,--
    Adores thee still;--and add--that when the towers
    And battlements which guard his joyous hours
    Of banquet, dance, and revel, are forgot,
    Or left untended in a dull repose,
    This--this--shall be a consecrated spot!                           240
    But _Thou_--when all that Birth and Beauty throws
    Of magic round thee is extinct--shalt have
    One half the laurel which o'ershades my grave.[188]
    No power in death can tear our names apart,
    As none in life could rend thee from my heart.[bj]
    Yes, Leonora! it shall be our fate
    To be entwined[189] for ever--but too late![190]

[176] [In a letter written to his friend Scipio Gonzaga ("Di prizione in
Sant' Anna, questo mese di mezzio l'anno 1579"), Tasso exclaims, "Ah,
wretched me! I had designed to write, besides two epic poems of most
noble argument, four tragedies, of which I had formed the plan. I had
schemed, too, many works in prose, on subjects the most lofty, and most
useful to human life; I had designed to unite philosophy with eloquence,
in such a manner that there might remain of me an eternal memory in the
world. Alas! I had expected to close my life with glory and renown; but
now, oppressed by the burden of so many calamities, I have lost every
prospect of reputation and of honour. The fear of perpetual imprisonment
increases my melancholy; the indignities which I suffer augment it; and
the squalor of my beard, my hair, and habit, the sordidness and filth,
exceedingly annoy me. Sure am I, that, if she who so little has
corresponded to my attachment--if she saw me in such a state, and in
such affliction--she would have some compassion on me."--_Lettere di
Torouato Tasso_, 1853, ii. 60.]

[178] [Tasso's imprisonment in the Hospital of Sant' Anna lasted from
March, 1579, to July, 1586. The _Gerusalemme_ had been finished many
years before. He sent the first four cantos to his friend Scipio
Gonzaga, February 17, and the last three on October 4, 1575 (_Lettere di
Torquato Tasso_, 1852, i. 55-117). A mutilated first edition was
published in 1580 by "Orazio _alias_ Celio de' Malespini, avventuriere
intrigante" (Solerti's _Vita, etc._, 1895, i. 329).]

[179] [So, too, Gibbon was overtaken by a "sober melancholy" when he had
finished the last line of the last page of the _Decline and Fall_ on the
night of June 27, 1787.]

[180] {145}[Not long after his imprisonment, Tasso appealed to the mercy
of Alfonso, in a canzone of great beauty, ... and ... in another ode to
the princesses, whose pity he invoked in the name of their own mother,
who had herself known, if not the like horrors, the like solitude of
imprisonment, and bitterness of soul, made a similar appeal. (See _Life
of Tasso_, by John Black, 1810, ii. 64, 408.) Black prints the canzone
in full; Solerti (_Vita, etc._, i. 316-318) gives selections.]

[181] {146}["For nearly the first year of his confinement Tasso endured
all the horrors of a solitary sordid cell, and was under the care of a
gaoler whose chief virtue, although he was a poet and a man of letters,
was a cruel obedience to the commands of his prince.... His name was
Agostino Mosti.... Tasso says of him, in a letter to his sister, 'ed usa
meco ogni sorte di rigore ed inumanità.'"--Hobhouse, _Historical
Illustrations, etc_., 1818, pp. 20, 21, note 1.

Tasso, in a letter to Angelo Grillo, dated June 16, 1584 (Letter 288,
_Le Lettere, etc_., ii. 276), complains that Mosti did not interfere to
prevent him being molested by the other inmates, disturbed in his
studies, and treated disrespectfully by the governor's subordinates. In
the letter to his sister Cornelia, from which Hobhouse quotes, the
allusion is not to Mosti, but, according to Solerti, to the Cardinal
Luigi d'Este. Elsewhere (Letter 133, _Lettere_, ii. 88, 89) Tasso
describes Agostino Mosti as a rigorous and zealous Churchman, but far
too cultivated and courteous a gentleman to have exercised any severity
towards him _proprio motu_, or otherwise than in obedience to orders.]

[182] {147}[It is highly improbable that Tasso openly indulged, or
secretly nourished, a consuming passion for Leonora d'Este, and it is
certain that the "Sister of his Sovereign" had nothing to do with his
being shut up in the Hospital of Sant' Anna. That poet and princess had
known each other for over thirteen years, that the princess was seven
years older than the poet, and, in March, 1579, close upon forty-two
years of age, are points to be considered; but the fact that she died in
February, 1581, and that Tasso remained in confinement for five years
longer, is a stronger argument against the truth of the legend. She was
a beautiful woman, his patroness and benefactress, and the theme of
sonnets and canzoni; but it was not for her "sweet sake" that Tasso lost
either his wits or his liberty.]

    "E certo il primo dì che'l bel sereno
      Delia tua fronte agli occhi miei s'offerse

[185] {149}[Ariosto (_Sat._ 7, Terz. 53) complains that his father
chased him "not with spurs only, but with darts and lances, to turn over
old texts," etc.; but Tasso was a studious and dutiful boy, and, though
he finally deserted the law for poetry, and "crossed" his father's
wishes and intentions, he took his own course reluctantly, and without
any breach of decorum. But, perhaps, the following translations from the
_Rinaldo,_ which Black supplies in his footnotes (i. 41. 97), suggested
this picture of a "poetic child" at variance with the authorities:--

    "Now hasting thence a verdant mead he found,
    Where flowers of fragrant smell adorned the ground;
    Sweet was the scene, and here from human eyes
    Apart he sits, and thus he speaks mid sighs."

                                                    Canto I. stanza xviii.

    "Thus have I sung in youth's aspiring days
    Rinaldo's pleasing plains and martial praise:
    While other studies slowly I pursued
    Ere twice revolved nine annual suns I viewed;
    Ungrateful studies, whence oppressed I groaned,
    A burden to myself and to the world unknown.

impaired, and that all my frame is become spare and meagre; but, passing
all this with a short sigh, what I would bewail is the infirmity of my
mind.... My mind sleeps, not thinks; my fancy is chill, and forms no
pictures; my negligent senses will no longer furnish the images of
things; my hand is sluggish in writing, and my pen seems as if it shrunk

                         INTRODUCTION TO _BEPPO_


_BEPPO_ was written in the autumn (September 6--October 12, _Letters_,
1900, iv. 172) of 1817, whilst Byron was still engaged on the additional
stanzas of the Fourth Canto of _Childe Harold_. His new poem, as he
admitted from the first, was "after the excellent manner" of John
Hookham Frere's _jeu d'esprit_, known as _Whistlecraft_ (_Prospectus and
Specimen of an intended National Work_ by William and Robert
Whistlecraft, London, 1818[192]), which must have reached him in the
summer of 1817. Whether he divined the identity of "Whistlecraft" from
the first, or whether his guess was an after-thought, he did not
hesitate to take the water and shoot ahead of his unsuspecting rival. It
was a case of plagiarism _in excelsis_, and the superiority of the
imitation to the original must be set down to the genius of the
plagiary, unaided by any profound study of Italian literature, or an
acquaintance at first hand with the parents and inspirers of
_Whistlecraft_.

It is possible that he had read and forgotten some specimens of Pulci's
_Morgante Maggiore_, which J. H. Merivale had printed in the _Monthly
Magazine_ for 1806-1807, vol. xxi. pp. 304, 510, etc., and it is certain
that he was familiar with his _Orlando in Roncesvalles_, published in
1814. He distinctly states that he had not seen W. S. Rose's[193]
translation of Casti's _Animali Parlanti_ (first edition [anonymous],
1816), but, according to Pryse Gordon (_Personal Memoirs_, ii. 328), he
had read the original. If we may trust Ugo Foscolo (see "Narrative and
Romantic Poems of the Italians" in the _Quart. Rev_., April, 1819, vol.
xxi. pp. 486-526), there is some evidence that Byron had read
Forteguerri's _Ricciardetto_ (translated in 1819 by Sylvester (Douglas)
Lord Glenbervie, and again, by John Herman Merivale, under the title of
_The Two First Cantos of Richardetto_, 1820), but the parallel which he
adduces (_vide post_, p. 166) is not very striking or convincing.

On the other hand, after the poem was completed (March 25, 1818), he was
under the impression that "Berni was the original of _all_ ... the
father of that kind [i.e. the mock-heroic] of writing;" but there is
nothing to show whether he had or had not read the _rifacimento_ of
Orlando's _Innamorato_, or the more distinctively Bernesque _Capitoli_.
Two years later (see Letter to Murray, February 21, 1820, _Letters_,
1900, iv. 407; and "Advertisement" to _Morgante Maggiore_) he had
discovered that "Pulci was the parent of _Whistlecraft_, and the
precursor and model of Berni," but, in 1817, he was only at the
commencement of his studies. A time came long before the "year or two"
of his promise (March 25, 1818) when he had learned to simulate the
_vera imago_ of the Italian Muse, and was able not only to surpass his
"immediate model," but to rival his model's forerunners and inspirers.
In the meanwhile a tale based on a "Venetian anecdote" (perhaps an
"episode" in the history of Colonel Fitzgerald and the Marchesa
Castiglione,--see Letter to Moore, December 26, 1816, _Letters_, 1900,
iv. 26) lent itself to "the excellent manner of Mr. Whistlecraft," and
would show "the knowing ones," that is, Murray's advisers, Gifford,
Croker, Frere, etc., that "he could write cheerfully," and "would repel
the charge of monotony and mannerism."

Eckermann, mindful of Goethe's hint that Byron had too much _empeiria_
(an excess of _mondanité_--a _this_-worldliness), found it hard to read
_Beppo_ after _Macbeth_. "I felt," he says, "the predominance of a
nefarious, empirical world, with which the mind which introduced it to
us has in a certain measure associated itself" (_Conversations of
Goethe, etc._, 1874, p. 175). But _Beppo_ must be taken at its own
valuation. It is _A Venetian Story_, and the action takes place behind
the scenes of "a comedy of Goldoni." A less subtle but a more apposite
criticism may be borrowed from "Lord Byron's Combolio" (_sic_),
_Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine_, 1822, xi. 162-165.

    "The story that's in it
    May be told in a minute;
    But _par parenthèse_ chatting,
    On this thing and that thing,
    Keeps the shuttlecock flying,
    And attention from dying."

_Beppo, a Venetian Story_ (xcv. stanzas) was published February 28,
1818; and a fifth edition, consisting of xcix. stanzas, was issued May
4, 1818.

Jeffrey, writing in the _Edinburgh Review_ (February, 1818, vol. xxix.
pp. 302-310), is unconcerned with regard to _Whistlecraft_, or any
earlier model, but observes "that the nearest approach to it [_Beppo_]
is to be found in some of the tales and lighter pieces of Prior--a few
stanzas here and there among the trash and burlesque of Peter Pindar,
and in several passages of Mr. Moore, and the author of the facetious
miscellany entitled the _Twopenny Post Bag_."

Other notices, of a less appreciative kind, appeared in the _Monthly
Review_, March, 1818, vol. 85, pp. 285-290; and in the _Eclectic
Review_, N.S., June, 1818, vol. ix. pp. 555-557.

    'Tis known, at least it should be, that throughout
      All countries of the Catholic persuasion,[195]
    Some weeks before Shrove Tuesday comes about,
      The People take their fill of recreation,
    And buy repentance, ere they grow devout,
      However high their rank, or low their station,
    With fiddling, feasting, dancing, drinking, masquing,
    And other things which may be had for asking.

                        II.

    The moment night with dusky mantle covers
      The skies (and the more duskily the better),
    The Time less liked by husbands than by lovers
      Begins, and Prudery flings aside her fetter;
    And Gaiety on restless tiptoe hovers,
      Giggling with all the gallants who beset her;
    And there are songs and quavers, roaring, humming,
    Guitars, and every other sort of strumming.[196]


                        III.

    And there are dresses splendid, but fantastical,
      Masks of all times and nations, Turks and Jews,
    And harlequins and clowns, with feats gymnastical,
      Greeks, Romans, Yankee-doodles, and Hindoos;
    All kinds of dress, except the ecclesiastical,
      All people, as their fancies hit, may choose,
    But no one in these parts may quiz the Clergy,--
    Therefore take heed, ye Freethinkers! I charge ye.

                        IV.

    You'd better walk about begirt with briars,
      Instead of coat and smallclothes, than put on
    A single stitch reflecting upon friars,
      Although you swore it only was in fun;
    They'd haul you o'er the coals, and stir the fires
      Of Phlegethon with every mother's son,
    Nor say one mass to cool the cauldron's bubble
    That boiled your bones, unless you paid them double.

                        V.

    But saving this, you may put on whate'er
      You like by way of doublet, cape, or cloak,
    Such as in Monmouth-street, or in Rag Fair,
      Would rig you out in seriousness or joke;
    And even in Italy such places are,
      With prettier name in softer accents spoke,
    For, bating Covent Garden, I can hit on
    No place that's called "Piazza" in Great Britain.[197]



                        VI.

    This feast is named the Carnival, which being
      Interpreted, implies "farewell to flesh:"
    So called, because the name and thing agreeing,
      Through Lent they live on fish both salt and fresh.
    But why they usher Lent with so much glee in,
      Is more than I can tell, although I guess
    'Tis as we take a glass with friends at parting,
    In the Stage-Coach or Packet, just at starting.

                        VII.

    And thus they bid farewell to carnal dishes,
      And solid meats, and highly spiced ragouts,
    To live for forty days on ill-dressed fishes,
      Because they have no sauces to their stews;
    A thing which causes many "poohs" and "pishes,"
      And several oaths (which would not suit the Muse),
    From travellers accustomed from a boy
    To eat their salmon, at the least, with soy;

                        VIII.

    And therefore humbly I would recommend
      "The curious in fish-sauce," before they cross
    The sea, to bid their cook, or wife, or friend,
       Walk or ride to the Strand, and buy in gross
    (Or if set out beforehand, these may send
       By any means least liable to loss),
    Ketchup, Soy, Chili-vinegar, and Harvey,
    Or, by the Lord! a Lent will well nigh starve ye;

                        IX.

    That is to say, if your religion's Roman,
      And you at Rome would do as Romans do,
    According to the proverb,--although no man,
      If foreign, is obliged to fast; and you,
    If Protestant, or sickly, or a woman,
      Would rather dine in sin on a ragout--
    Dine and be d--d! I don't mean to be coarse,
    But that's the penalty, to say no worse.

                        X.

    Of all the places where the Carnival
      Was most facetious in the days of yore,
    For dance, and song, and serenade, and ball,
      And Masque, and Mime, and Mystery, and more
    Than I have time to tell now, or at all,
      Venice the bell from every city bore,--
    And at the moment when I fix my story,
    That sea-born city was in all her glory.

                        XI.

    They've pretty faces yet, those same Venetians,
      Black eyes, arched brows, and sweet expressions still;
    Such as of old were copied from the Grecians,
      In ancient arts by moderns mimicked ill;
    And like so many Venuses of Titian's[198]
      (The best's at Florence--see it, if ye will,)
    They look when leaning over the balcony,
    Or stepped from out a picture by Giorgione,[199]

                        XII.

    Whose tints are Truth and Beauty at their best;
      And when you to Manfrini's palace go,[200]
    That picture (howsoever fine the rest)
      Is loveliest to my mind of all the show;
    It may perhaps be also to _your_ zest,
      And that's the cause I rhyme upon it so:
    Tis but a portrait of his Son, and Wife,
    And self; but _such_ a Woman! Love in life![201]

                        XIII.

    Love in full life and length, not love ideal,
      No, nor ideal beauty, that fine name,
    But something better still, so very real,
      That the sweet Model must have been the same;
    A thing that you would purchase, beg, or steal,
      Wer't not impossible, besides a shame:
    The face recalls some face, as 'twere with pain,
    You once have seen, but ne'er will see again;

                        XIV.

    One of those forms which flit by us, when we
      Are young, and fix our eyes on every face;
    And, oh! the Loveliness at times we see
      In momentary gliding, the soft grace,
    The Youth, the Bloom, the Beauty which agree,
      In many a nameless being we retrace,
    Whose course and home we knew not, nor shall know,
    Like the lost Pleiad[202] seen no more below.

                        XV.

    I said that like a picture by Giorgione
      Venetian women were, and so they _are_,
    Particularly seen from a balcony,
      (For beauty's sometimes best set off afar)
    And there, just like a heroine of Goldoni,[202A]
      They peep from out the blind, or o'er the bar;
    And truth to say, they're mostly very pretty,
    And rather like to show it, more's the pity!

                        XVI.

    For glances beget ogles, ogles sighs,
      Sighs wishes, wishes words, and words a letter,
    Which flies on wings of light-heeled Mercuries,
      Who do such things because they know no better;
    And then, God knows what mischief may arise,
      When Love links two young people in one fetter,
    Vile assignations, and adulterous beds,
    Elopements, broken vows, and hearts, and heads.

                        XVII.

    Shakspeare described the sex in Desdemona
      As very fair, but yet suspect in fame,[202B]
    And to this day from Venice to Verona
      Such matters may be probably the same,
    Except that since those times was never known a
      Husband whom mere suspicion could inflame
    To suffocate a wife no more than twenty,
    Because she had a "Cavalier Servente."[203]

                        XVIII.

    Their jealousy (if they are ever jealous)
      Is of a fair complexion altogether,
    Not like that sooty devil of Othello's,
      Which smothers women in a bed of feather,
    But worthier of these much more jolly fellows,
      When weary of the matrimonial tether
    His head for such a wife no mortal bothers,
    But takes at once another, or _another's_.

                        XIX.

    Didst ever see a Gondola? For fear
      You should not, I'll describe it you exactly:
    'Tis a long covered boat that's common here,
      Carved at the prow, built lightly, but compactly,
    Rowed by two rowers, each call'd "Gondolier,"
      It glides along the water looking blackly,
    Just like a coffin clapt in a canoe,
    Where none can make out what you say or do.

                        XX.

    And up and down the long canals they go,
      And under the Rialto[204] shoot along,
    By night and day, all paces, swift or slow,
      And round the theatres, a sable throng,
    They wait in their dusk livery of woe,--
      But not to them do woeful things belong,
    For sometimes they contain a deal of fun,
    Like mourning coaches when the funeral's done.

                        XXI.

    But to my story.--'Twas some years ago,
      It may be thirty, forty, more or less,
    The Carnival was at its height, and so
      Were all kinds of buffoonery and dress;
    A certain lady went to see the show,
      Her real name I know not, nor can guess,
    And so we'll call her Laura, if you please,
    Because it slips into my verse with ease.

                        XXII.

    She was not old, nor young, nor at the years
      Which certain people call a "_certain age_,"[205]
    Which yet the most uncertain age appears,
      Because I never heard, nor could engage
    A person yet by prayers, or bribes, or tears,
      To name, define by speech, or write on page,
    The period meant precisely by that word,--
    Which surely is exceedingly absurd.

                        XXIII.

    Laura was blooming still, had made the best
      Of Time, and Time returned the compliment,
    And treated her genteelly, so that, dressed,
      She looked extremely well where'er she went;
    A pretty woman is a welcome guest,
      And Laura's brow a frown had rarely bent;
    Indeed, she shone all smiles, and seemed to flatter
    Mankind with her black eyes for looking at her.

                        XXIV.

    She was a married woman; 'tis convenient,
      Because in Christian countries 'tis a rule
    To view their little slips with eyes more lenient;
      Whereas if single ladies play the fool,
    (Unless within the period intervenient
      A well-timed wedding makes the scandal cool)
    I don't know how they ever can get over it,
    Except they manage never to discover it.

                        XXV.

    Her husband sailed upon the Adriatic,
      And made some voyages, too, in other seas,
    And when he lay in Quarantine for pratique[206]
      (A forty days' precaution 'gainst disease),
    His wife would mount, at times, her highest attic,
      For thence she could discern the ship with ease:
    He was a merchant trading to Aleppo,
    His name Giuseppe, called more briefly, Beppo.[207]

                        XXVI.

    He was a man as dusky as a Spaniard,
      Sunburnt with travel, yet a portly figure;
    Though coloured, as it were, within a tanyard,
      He was a person both of sense and vigour--
    A better seaman never yet did man yard;
      And she, although her manners showed no rigour,
    Was deemed a woman of the strictest principle,
    So much as to be thought almost invincible.[208]

                        XXVII.

    But several years elapsed since they had met;
      Some people thought the ship was lost, and some
    That he had somehow blundered into debt,
      And did not like the thought of steering home;
    And there were several offered any bet,
      Or that he would, or that he would not come;
    For most men (till by losing rendered sager)
    Will back their own opinions with a wager.

                        XXVIII.

    'Tis said that their last parting was pathetic,
      As partings often are, or ought to be,
    And their presentiment was quite prophetic,
      That they should never more each other see,
    (A sort of morbid feeling, half poetic,
      Which I have known occur in two or three,)
    When kneeling on the shore upon her sad knee
    He left this Adriatic Ariadne.

                        XXIX.

    And Laura waited long, and wept a little,
      And thought of wearing weeds, as well she might;
    She almost lost all appetite for victual,
      And could not sleep with ease alone at night;
    She deemed the window-frames and shutters brittle
      Against a daring housebreaker or sprite,
    And so she thought it prudent to connect her
    With a vice-husband, _chiefly_ to _protect her_.

                        XXX.

    She chose, (and what is there they will not choose,
      If only you will but oppose their choice?)
    Till Beppo should return from his long cruise,
      And bid once more her faithful heart rejoice,
    A man some women like, and yet abuse--
      A Coxcomb was he by the public voice;
    A Count of wealth, they said as well as quality,
    And in his pleasures of great liberality.[bk]

                        XXXI.

    And then he was a Count, and then he knew
      Music, and dancing, fiddling, French and Tuscan;
    The last not easy, be it known to you,
      For few Italians speak the right Etruscan.
    He was a critic upon operas, too,
      And knew all niceties of sock and buskin;
    And no Venetian audience could endure a
    Song, scene, or air, when he cried "seccatura!"[209]

                        XXXII.

    His "bravo" was decisive, for that sound
      Hushed "Academie" sighed in silent awe;
    The fiddlers trembled as he looked around,
      For fear of some false note's detected flaw;
    The "Prima Donna's" tuneful heart would bound,
      Dreading the deep damnation of his "Bah!"
    Soprano, Basso, even the Contra-Alto,
    Wished him five fathom under the Rialto.

                        XXXIII.

    He patronised the Improvisatori,
      Nay, could himself extemporise some stanzas,
    Wrote rhymes, sang songs, could also tell a story,
      Sold pictures, and was skilful in the dance as
    Italians can be, though in this their glory
      Must surely yield the palm to that which France has;
    In short, he was a perfect Cavaliero,
    And to his very valet seemed a hero.[210]

                        XXXIV.

    Then he was faithful too, as well as amorous;
      So that no sort of female could complain,
    Although they're now and then a little clamorous,
      He never put the pretty souls in pain;
    His heart was one of those which most enamour us,
      Wax to receive, and marble to retain:
    He was a lover of the good old school,
    Who still become more constant as they cool.

                        XXXV.

    No wonder such accomplishments should turn
      A female head, however sage and steady--
    With scarce a hope that Beppo could return,
      In law he was almost as good as dead, he
    Nor sent, nor wrote, nor showed the least concern,
      And she had waited several years already:
    And really if a man won't let us know
    That he's alive, he's _dead_--or should be so.

                        XXXVI.

    Besides, within the Alps, to every woman,
      (Although, God knows, it is a grievous sin,)
    'Tis, I may say, permitted to have _two_ men;
      I can't tell who first brought the custom in,
    But "Cavalier Serventes" are quite common,
      And no one notices or cares a pin;
    An we may call this (not to say the worst)
    A _second_ marriage which corrupts the _first_.

                        XXXVII.

    The word was formerly a "Cicisbeo,"[211]
      But _that_ is now grown vulgar and indecent;
    The Spaniards call the person a "_Cortejo_,"[212]
      For the same mode subsists in Spain, though recent;
    In short it reaches from the Po to Teio,
      And may perhaps at last be o'er the sea sent:
    But Heaven preserve Old England from such courses!
    Or what becomes of damage and divorces?

                        XXXVIII.[213]

    However, I still think, with all due deference
      To the fair _single_ part of the creation,
    That married ladies should preserve the preference
      In _tête à tête_ or general conversation--
    And this I say without peculiar reference
      To England, France, or any other nation--
    Because they know the world, and are at ease,
    And being natural, naturally please.

                        XXXIX.

    'Tis true, your budding Miss is very charming,
      But shy and awkward at first coming out,
    So much alarmed, that she is quite alarming,
      All Giggle, Blush; half Pertness, and half Pout;
    And glancing at _Mamma_, for fear there's harm in
      What you, she, it, or they, may be about:
    The Nursery still lisps out in all they utter--
    Besides, they always smell of bread and butter.[214]

                        XL.

    But "Cavalier Servente" is the phrase
      Used in politest circles to express
    This supernumerary slave, who stays
      Close to the lady as a part of dress,
    Her word the only law which he obeys.
      His is no sinecure, as you may guess;
    Coach, servants, gondola, he goes to call,
    And carries fan and tippet, gloves and shawl.

                        XLI.

    With all its sinful doings, I must say,
      That Italy's a pleasant place to me,
    Who love to see the Sun shine every day,
      And vines (not nailed to walls) from tree to tree
    Festooned, much like the back scene of a play,
      Or melodrame, which people flock to see,
    When the first act is ended by a dance
    In vineyards copied from the South of France.

                        XLII.

    I like on Autumn evenings to ride out,
      Without being forced to bid my groom be sure
    My cloak is round his middle strapped about,
      Because the skies are not the most secure;
    I know too that, if stopped upon my route,
      Where the green alleys windingly allure,
    Reeling with _grapes_ red wagons choke the way,--
    In England 'twould be dung, dust, or a dray.

                        XLIII.

    I also like to dine on becaficas,
      To see the Sun set, sure he'll rise to-morrow,
    Not through a misty morning twinkling weak as
      A drunken man's dead eye in maudlin sorrow,
    But with all Heaven t'himself; the day will break as
      Beauteous as cloudless, nor be forced to borrow
    That sort of farthing candlelight which glimmers
    Where reeking London's smoky cauldron simmers.

                        XLIV.

    I love the language, that soft bastard Latin,[215]
      Which melts like kisses from a female mouth,
    And sounds as if it should be writ on satin,[216]
      With syllables which breathe of the sweet South,
    And gentle liquids gliding all so pat in,
      That not a single accent seems uncouth,
    Like our harsh northern whistling, grunting guttural,
    Which we're obliged to hiss, and spit, and sputter all.

                        XLV.

    I like the women too (forgive my folly!),
      From the rich peasant cheek of ruddy bronze,[bl]
    And large black eyes that flash on you a volley
      Of rays that say a thousand things at once,
    To the high Dama's brow, more melancholy,
      But clear, and with a wild and liquid glance,
    Heart on her lips, and soul within her eyes,
    Soft as her clime, and sunny as her skies.[bm]

                        XLVI.

    Eve of the land which still is Paradise!
      Italian Beauty didst thou not inspire
    Raphael,[217] who died in thy embrace, and vies
      With all we know of Heaven, or can desire,
    In what he hath bequeathed us?--in what guise,
      Though flashing from the fervour of the Lyre,
    Would _words_ describe thy past and present glow,
    While yet Canova[218] can create below?[219]

                        XLVII.

    "England! with all thy faults I love thee still,"[220]
      I said at Calais, and have not forgot it;
    I like to speak and lucubrate my fill;
      I like the government (but that is not it);
    I like the freedom of the press and quill;
      I like the Habeas Corpus (when we've got it);
    I like a Parliamentary debate,
    Particularly when 'tis not too late;

                        XLVIII.

    I like the taxes, when they're not too many;
      I like a seacoal fire, when not too dear;
    I like a beef-steak, too, as well as any;
      Have no objection to a pot of beer;
    I like the weather,--when it is not rainy,
      That is, I like two months of every year.
    And so God save the Regent, Church, and King!
    Which means that I like all and every thing.

                        XLIX.

    Our standing army, and disbanded seamen,
      Poor's rate, Reform, my own, the nation's debt,
    Our little riots just to show we're free men,
      Our trifling bankruptcies in the Gazette,
    Our cloudy climate, and our chilly women,
      All these I can forgive, and those forget,
    And greatly venerate our recent glories,
    And wish they were not owing to the Tories.

                        L.

    But to my tale of Laura,--for I find
      Digression is a sin, that by degrees
    Becomes exceeding tedious to my mind,
      And, therefore, may the reader too displease--
    The gentle reader, who may wax unkind,
      And caring little for the Author's ease,
    Insist on knowing what he means--a hard
    And hapless situation for a Bard.

                        LI.

    Oh! that I had the art of easy writing
      What should be easy reading! could I scale
    Parnassus, where the Muses sit inditing
      Those pretty poems never known to fail,
    How quickly would I print (the world delighting)
      A Grecian, Syrian,[221] or _Ass_yrian tale;
    And sell you, mixed with western Sentimentalism,
    Some samples of the _finest Orientalism._

                        LII.

    But I am but a nameless sort of person,
      (A broken Dandy[222] lately on my travels)
    And take for rhyme, to hook my rambling verse on,
      The first that Walker's Lexicon unravels,
    And when I can't find that, I put a worse on,
      Not caring as I ought for critics' cavils;
    I've half a mind to tumble down to prose,
    But verse is more in fashion--so here goes!

                        LIII.

    The Count and Laura made their new arrangement,
      Which lasted, as arrangements sometimes do,
    For half a dozen years without estrangement;
      They had their little differences, too;
    Those jealous whiffs, which never any change meant;
      In such affairs there probably are few
    Who have not had this pouting sort of squabble,
    From sinners of high station to the rabble.

                        LIV.

    But, on the whole, they were a happy pair,
      As happy as unlawful love could make them;
    The gentleman was fond, the lady fair,
      Their chains so slight, 'twas not worth while to break them:
    The World beheld them with indulgent air;
      The pious only wished "the Devil take them!"
    He took them not; he very often waits,
    And leaves old sinners to be young ones' baits.

                        LV.

    But they were young: Oh! what without our Youth
      Would Love be! What would Youth be without Love!
    Youth lends its joy, and sweetness, vigour, truth,
      Heart, soul, and all that seems as from above;
    But, languishing with years, it grows uncouth--
      One of few things Experience don't improve;
    Which is, perhaps, the reason why old fellows
    Are always so preposterously jealous.

                        LVI.

    It was the Carnival, as I have said
      Some six and thirty stanzas back, and so
    Laura the usual preparations made,
      Which you do when your mind's made up to go
    To-night to Mrs. Boehm's masquerade,[223]
      Spectator, or Partaker in the show;
    The only difference known between the cases
    Is--_here_, we have six weeks of "varnished faces."


                        LVII.

    Laura, when dressed, was (as I sang before)
      A pretty woman as was ever seen,
    Fresh as the Angel o'er a new inn door,
      Or frontispiece of a new Magazine,[224]
    With all the fashions which the last month wore,
      Coloured, and silver paper leaved between
    That and the title-page, for fear the Press
    Should soil with parts of speech the parts of dress.

                        LVIII.

    They went to the Ridotto;[225] 'tis a hall
      Where People dance, and sup, and dance again;
    Its proper name, perhaps, were a masqued ball,
      But that's of no importance to my strain;
    'Tis (on a smaller scale) like our Vauxhall,
      Excepting that it can't be spoilt by rain;
    The company is "mixed" (the phrase I quote is
    As much as saying, they're below your notice);

                        LIX.

    For a "mixed company" implies that, save
      Yourself and friends, and half a hundred more,
    Whom you may bow to without looking grave,
      The rest are but a vulgar set, the Bore
    Of public places, where they basely brave
      The fashionable stare of twenty score
    Of well-bred persons, called "_The World_;" but I,
    Although I know them, really don't know why.

                        LX.

    This is the case in England; at least was
      During the dynasty of Dandies, now
    Perchance succeeded by some other class
      Of imitated Imitators:--how[bn]
    Irreparably soon decline, alas!
      The Demagogues of fashion: all below
    Is frail; how easily the world is lost
    By Love, or War, and, now and then,--by Frost!

                        LXI.

    Crushed was Napoleon by the northern Thor,
      Who knocked his army down with icy hammer,
    Stopped by the _Elements_[226]--like a Whaler--or
      A blundering novice in his new French grammar;
    Good cause had he to doubt the chance of war,
      And as for Fortune--but I dare not d--n her,
    Because, were I to ponder to Infinity,
    The more I should believe in her Divinity.[227]

                        LXII.

    She rules the present, past, and all to be yet,
      She gives us luck in lotteries, love, and marriage;
    I cannot say that she's done much for me yet;
      Not that I mean her bounties to disparage,
    We've not yet closed accounts, and we shall see yet
      How much she'll make amends for past miscarriage;
    Meantime the Goddess I'll no more importune,
    Unless to thank her when she's made my fortune.

                        LXIII.

    To turn,--and to return;--the Devil take it!
      This story slips for ever through my fingers,
    Because, just as the stanza likes to make it,
      It needs must be--and so it rather lingers;
    This form of verse began, I can't well break it,
      But must keep time and tune like public singers;
    But if I once get through my present measure,
    I'll take another when I'm next at leisure.

                        LXIV.

    They went to the Ridotto ('tis a place
      To which I mean to go myself to-morrow,[228]
    Just to divert my thoughts a little space
      Because I'm rather hippish, and may borrow
    Some spirits, guessing at what kind of face
      May lurk beneath each mask; and as my sorrow
    Slackens its pace sometimes, I'll make, or find,
    Something shall leave it half an hour behind.)

                        LXV.

    Now Laura moves along the joyous crowd,
      Smiles in her eyes, and simpers on her lips;
    To some she whispers, others speaks aloud;
      To some she curtsies, and to some she dips,
    Complains of warmth, and this complaint avowed,
      Her lover brings the lemonade, she sips;
    She then surveys, condemns, but pities still
    Her dearest friends for being dressed so ill.

                        LXVI.

    One has false curls, another too much paint,
      A third--where did she buy that frightful turban?
    A fourth's so pale she fears she's going to faint,
      A fifth's look's vulgar, dowdyish, and suburban,
    A sixth's white silk has got a yellow taint,
      A seventh's thin muslin surely will be her bane,
    And lo! an eighth appears,--"I'll see no more!"
    For fear, like Banquo's kings, they reach a score.

                        LXVII.

    Meantime, while she was thus at others gazing,
      Others were levelling their looks at her;
    She heard the men's half-whispered mode of praising
      And, till 'twas done, determined not to stir;
    The women only thought it quite amazing
      That, at her time of life, so many were
    Admirers still,--but "Men are so debased,
    Those brazen Creatures always suit their taste."

                        LXVIII.

    For my part, now, I ne'er could understand
      Why naughty women--but I won't discuss
    A thing which is a scandal to the land,
      I only don't see why it should be thus;
    And if I were but in a gown and band,
      Just to entitle me to make a fuss,
    I'd preach on this till Wilberforce and Romilly
    Should quote in their next speeches from my homily.

                        LXIX.

    While Laura thus was seen, and seeing, smiling,
      Talking, she knew not why, and cared not what,
    So that her female friends, with envy broiling,
      Beheld her airs, and triumph, and all that;
    And well-dressed males still kept before her filing,
      And passing bowed and mingled with her chat;
    More than the rest one person seemed to stare
    With pertinacity that's rather rare.

                        LXX.

    He was a Turk, the colour of mahogany;
      And Laura saw him, and at first was glad,
    Because the Turks so much admire philogyny,[bo]
      Although their usage of their wives is sad;
    'Tis said they use no better than a dog any
      Poor woman, whom they purchase like a pad:
    They have a number, though they ne'er exhibit 'em,
    Four wives by law, and concubines "ad libitum."

                        LXXI.

    They lock them up, and veil, and guard them daily,
      They scarcely can behold their male relations,
    So that their moments do not pass so gaily
      As is supposed the case with northern nations;
    Confinement, too, must make them look quite palely;
      And as the Turks abhor long conversations,
    Their days are either passed in doing nothing,
    Or bathing, nursing, making love, and clothing.

                        LXXII.

    They cannot read, and so don't lisp in criticism;
      Nor write, and so they don't affect the Muse;
    Were never caught in epigram or witticism,
      Have no romances, sermons, plays, reviews,--
    In Harams learning soon would make a pretty schism,
      But luckily these Beauties are no "Blues;"
    No bustling _Botherby_[229] have they to show 'em
    "That charming passage in the last new poem:"


                        LXXIII.

    No solemn, antique gentleman of rhyme,
      Who having angled all his life for Fame,
    And getting but a nibble at a time,
      Still fussily keeps fishing on, the same
    Small "Triton of the minnows," the sublime
      Of Mediocrity, the furious tame,
    The Echo's echo, usher of the school
    Of female wits, boy bards--in short, a fool!

                        LXXIV.

    A stalking oracle of awful phrase,
      The approving _"Good!"_ (by no means good in law)
    Humming like flies around the newest blaze,
      The bluest of bluebottles you e'er saw,
    Teasing with blame, excruciating with praise,
      Gorging the little fame he gets all raw,[bp]
    Translating tongues he knows not even by letter,
    And sweating plays so middling, bad were better.

                        LXXV.

    One hates an author that's _all author_--fellows
      In foolscap uniforms turned up with ink,
    So very anxious, clever, fine, and jealous,
      One don't know what to say to them, or think,
    Unless to puff them with a pair of bellows;
      Of Coxcombry's worst coxcombs e'en the pink
    Are preferable to these shreds of paper,
    These unquenched snuffings of the midnight taper.

                        LXXVI.

    Of these same we see several, and of others.
      Men of the world, who know the World like Men,
    Scott, Rogers, Moore, and all the better brothers,
      Who think of something else besides the pen;
    But for the children of the "Mighty Mother's,"
      The would-be wits, and can't-be gentlemen,
    I leave them to their daily "tea is ready,"[230]
    Smug coterie, and literary lady.

                        LXXVII.

    The poor dear Mussul_women_ whom I mention
      Have none of these instructive pleasant people,
    And _one_ would seem to them a new invention,
      Unknown as bells within a Turkish steeple;
    I think 'twould almost be worth while to pension
      (Though best-sown projects very often reap ill)
    A missionary author--just to preach
    Our Christian usage of the parts of speech.

                        LXXVIII.

    No Chemistry for them unfolds her gases,
      No Metaphysics are let loose in lectures,
    No Circulating Library amasses
      Religious novels, moral tales, and strictures
    Upon the living manners, as they pass us;
      No Exhibition glares with annual pictures;
    They stare not on the stars from out their attics,
    Nor deal (thank God for that!) in Mathematics.[231]

                        LXXIX.

    Why I thank God for that is no great matter,
      I have my reasons, you no doubt suppose,
    And as, perhaps, they would not highly flatter,
      I'll keep them for my life (to come) in prose;
    I fear I have a little turn for Satire,
      And yet methinks the older that one grows
    Inclines us more to laugh than scold, though Laughter
    Leaves us so doubly serious shortly after.

                        LXXX.[232]

    Oh, Mirth and Innocence! Oh, Milk and Water!
      Ye happy mixtures of more happy days!
    In these sad centuries of sin and slaughter,
      Abominable Man no more allays
    His thirst with such pure beverage. No matter,
      I love you both, and both shall have my praise:
    Oh, for old Saturn's reign of sugar-candy!---
    Meantime I drink to your return in brandy.

                        LXXXI.

    Our Laura's Turk still kept his eyes upon her,
      Less in the Mussulman than Christian way,
    Which seems to say, "Madam, I do you honour,
      And while I please to stare, you'll please to stay."
    Could staring win a woman, this had won her,
      But Laura could not thus be led astray;
    She had stood fire too long and well, to boggle
    Even at this Stranger's most outlandish ogle.

                        LXXXII.

    The morning now was on the point of breaking,
      A turn of time at which I would advise
    Ladies who have been dancing, or partaking
      In any other kind of exercise,
    To make their preparations for forsaking
      The ball-room ere the Sun begins to rise,
    Because when once the lamps and candles fail,
    His blushes make them look a little pale.

                        LXXXIII.

    I've seen some balls and revels in my time,
      And stayed them over for some silly reason,
    And then I looked (I hope it was no crime)
      To see what lady best stood out the season;
    And though I've seen some thousands in their prime
      Lovely and pleasing, and who still may please on,
    I never saw but one (the stars withdrawn)
    Whose bloom could after dancing dare the Dawn.

                        LXXXIV.

    The name of this Aurora I'll not mention,
      Although I might, for she was nought to me
    More than that patent work of God's invention,
      A charming woman, whom we like to see;
    But writing names would merit reprehension,
      Yet if you like to find out this fair _She,_
    At the next London or Parisian ball
    You still may mark her cheek, out-blooming all.

                        LXXXV.

    Laura, who knew it would not do at all
      To meet the daylight after seven hours' sitting
    Among three thousand people at a ball,
      To make her curtsey thought it right and fitting;
    The Count was at her elbow with her shawl,
      And they the room were on the point of quitting,
    When lo! those curséd Gondoliers had got
    Just in the very place where they _should not._

                        LXXXVI.

    In this they're like our coachmen, and the cause
      Is much the same--the crowd, and pulling, hauling,
    With blasphemies enough to break their jaws,
      They make a never intermitted bawling.
    At home, our Bow-street gem'men keep the laws,
      And here a sentry stands within your calling;
    But for all that, there is a deal of swearing,
    And nauseous words past mentioning or bearing.

                        LXXXVII.

    The Count and Laura found their boat at last,
      And homeward floated o'er the silent tide,
    Discussing all the dances gone and past;
      The dancers and their dresses, too, beside;
    Some little scandals eke; but all aghast
      (As to their palace-stairs the rowers glide)
    Sate Laura by the side of her adorer,[bq]
    When lo! the Mussulman was there before her!


                        LXXXVIII.

    "Sir," said the Count, with brow exceeding grave,
      "Your unexpected presence here will make
    It necessary for myself to crave
      Its import? But perhaps 'tis a mistake;
    I hope it is so; and, at once to waive
      All compliment, I hope so for _your_ sake;
    You understand my meaning, or you _shall._"
    "Sir," (quoth the Turk) "'tis no mistake at all:

                        LXXXIX.

    "That Lady is _my wife!_" Much wonder paints
      The lady's changing cheek, as well it might;
    But where an Englishwoman sometimes faints,
      Italian females don't do so outright;
    They only call a little on their Saints,
      And then come to themselves, almost, or quite;
    Which saves much hartshorn, salts, and sprinkling faces,
    And cutting stays, as usual in such cases.

                        XC.

    She said,--what could she say? Why, not a word;
      But the Count courteously invited in
    The Stranger, much appeased by what he heard:
      "Such things, perhaps, we'd best discuss within,"
    Said he; "don't let us make ourselves absurd
      In public, by a scene, nor raise a din,
    For then the chief and only satisfaction
    Will be much quizzing on the whole transaction."

                        XCI.

    They entered, and for Coffee called--it came,
      A beverage for Turks and Christians both,
    Although the way they make it's not the same.
      Now Laura, much recovered, or less loth
    To speak, cries "Beppo! what's your pagan name?
      Bless me! your beard is of amazing growth!
    And how came you to keep away so long?
    Are you not sensible 'twas very wrong?

                        XCII.

    "And are you _really, truly,_ now a Turk?
      With any other women did you wive?
    Is't true they use their fingers for a fork?
      Well, that's the prettiest Shawl--as I'm alive!
    You'll give it me? They say you eat no pork.
      And how so many years did you contrive
    To--Bless me! did I ever? No, I never
    Saw a man grown so yellow! How's your liver?

                        XCIII.

    "Beppo! that beard of yours becomes you not;
      It shall be shaved before you're a day older:
    Why do you wear it? Oh! I had forgot--
      Pray don't you think the weather here is colder?
    How do I look? You shan't stir from this spot
      In that queer dress, for fear that some beholder
    Should find you out, and make the story known.
    How short your hair is! Lord! how grey it's grown!"

                        XCIV.

    What answer Beppo made to these demands
      Is more than I know. He was cast away
    About where Troy stood once, and nothing stands;
      Became a slave of course, and for his pay
    Had bread and bastinadoes, till some bands
      Of pirates landing in a neighbouring bay,
    He joined the rogues and prospered, and became
    A renegade of indifferent fame.

                        XCV.

    But he grew rich, and with his riches grew so
      Keen the desire to see his home again,
    He thought himself in duty bound to do so,
      And not be always thieving on the main;
    Lonely he felt, at times, as Robin Crusoe,
      And so he hired a vessel come from Spain,
    Bound for Corfu: she was a fine polacca,
    Manned with twelve hands, and laden with tobacco.

                        XCVI.

    Himself, and much (heaven knows how gotten!) cash,
      He then embarked, with risk of life and limb,
    And got clear off, although the attempt was rash;
      _He_ said that _Providence_ protected him--
    For my part, I say nothing--lest we clash
      In our opinions:--well--the ship was trim,
    Set sail, and kept her reckoning fairly on,
    Except three days of calm when off Cape Bonn.[233]

                        XCVII.

    They reached the Island, he transferred his lading,
      And self and live stock to another bottom,
    And passed for a true Turkey-merchant, trading
      With goods of various names--but I've forgot 'em.
    However, he got off by this evading,
      Or else the people would perhaps have shot him;
    And thus at Venice landed to reclaim
    His wife, religion, house, and Christian name.

                        XCVIII.

    His wife received, the Patriarch re-baptised him,
      (He made the Church a present, by the way;)
    He then threw off the garments which disguised him,
      And borrowed the Count's smallclothes for a day:
    His friends the more for his long absence prized him,
      Finding he'd wherewithal to make them gay,
    With dinners, where he oft became the laugh of them,
    For stories--but _I_ don't believe the half of them.

                        XCIX.

    Whate'er his youth had suffered, his old age
      With wealth and talking made him some amends;
    Though Laura sometimes put him in a rage,
      I've heard the Count and he were always friends.
    My pen is at the bottom of a page,
      Which being finished, here the story ends:
    'Tis to be wished it had been sooner done,
    But stories somehow lengthen when begun.

      I never shall regret the pains it took,
        That's just the sort of fame that I should choose:
      To sail about the world like Captain Cook,
        I'd sling a cot up for my favourite Muse,
      And we'd take verses out to Demerara,
        To New South Wales, and up to Niagara.

      "Poets consume exciseable commodities,
        They raise the nation's spirit when victorious,
      They drive an export trade in whims and oddities,
         Making our commerce and revenue glorious;
      As an industrious and pains-taking body 'tis
         That Poets should be reckoned meritorious:
      And therefore I submissively propose
        To erect one Board for Verse and one for Prose.

      "Princes protecting Sciences and Art
        I've often seen in copper-plate and print;
      I never saw them elsewhere, for my part,

      "From Princes I descend to the Nobility:
        In former times all persons of high stations,
      Lords, Baronets, and Persons of gentility,

      This practice was attended with utility;
        The patrons lived to future generations,
      The poets lived by their industrious earning,--
      So men alive and dead could live by Learning.

      "Then twenty guineas was a little fortune;
        Now, we must starve unless the times should mend:
      Our poets now-a-days are deemed importune
        If their addresses are diffusely penned;
      Most fashionable authors make a short one
        To their own wife, or child, or private friend,
      To show their independence, I suppose;
      And that may do for Gentlemen like those.

    "Lastly, the common people I beseech--
        Dear People! if you think my verses clever,
      Preserve with care your noble parts of speech,
        And take it as a maxim to endeavour
      To talk as your good mothers used to teach,

theological niceties were not regarded, and the great gulph between a
religion and a sect or party was imperfectly discerned. Hence the

Among them, there is a portrait of Ariosto by Titian [now in the

the power of painting or human expression: it is the poetry of portrait,
and the portrait of poetry. There was also one of some learned lady,
centuries old, whose name I forget, but whose features must always be
remembered. I never saw greater beauty, or sweetness, or wisdom:--it is
the kind of face to go mad for, because it cannot walk out of its
frame.... What struck me most in the general collection was the extreme
resemblance of the style of the female faces in the mass of pictures, so
many centuries or generations old, to those you see and meet every day
amongst the existing Italians. The Queen of Cyprus and Giorgione's wife,

caught Byron's fancy was the so-called _Famiglia di Giorgione_, which
was removed from the Manfrini Palace in 1856, and is now in the Palazzo

(see his letter to his uncle Simone di Battista di Ciarla da Urbino,
dated July 1, 1514), and it is a fact that a girl named Margarita,

disclaimer, refers to the firmness of his "former persuasion," and
renews the attack with increased bitterness. "As to _Beppo,_ I will not
alter or suppress a syllable for any man's pleasure but my own. If there
are resemblances between Botherby and Sotheby, or Sotheby and Botherby,
the fault is not mine, but in the person who resembles,--or the persons
who trace a resemblance. _Who_ find out this resemblance? Mr. S.'s
_friends._ _Who_ go about moaning over him and laughing? Mr. S.'s
_friends"_ (Letters to Murray, April 17, 23, 1818, _Letters,_ 1900, iv.
226-230). A writer of satires is of necessity satirical, and Sotheby,
like "Wordswords and Co.," made excellent "copy." If he had not written
the "anonymous note," he was, from Byron's point of view, ridiculous and
a bore, and "ready to hand" to be tossed up in rhyme as _Botherby._ (For
a brief account of Sotheby, see _Poetical Works,_ i. 362, note 2.)]

                            ODE ON VENICE[234]

                        I.

    Oh Venice! Venice! when thy marble walls
      Are level with the waters, there shall be
    A cry of nations o'er thy sunken halls,
      A loud lament along the sweeping sea!
    If I, a northern wanderer, weep for thee,
    What should thy sons do?--anything but weep:
    And yet they only murmur in their sleep.
    In contrast with their fathers--as the slime,
    The dull green ooze of the receding deep,
    Is with the dashing of the spring-tide foam,                        10
    That drives the sailor shipless to his home,
    Are they to those that were; and thus they creep,
    Crouching and crab-like, through their sapping streets.
    Oh! agony--that centuries should reap
    No mellower harvest! Thirteen hundred years[235]
    Of wealth and glory turned to dust and tears;
    And every monument the stranger meets,
    Church, palace, pillar, as a mourner greets;
    And even the Lion all subdued appears,[236]
    And the harsh sound of the barbarian drum,                          20
    With dull and daily dissonance, repeats
    The echo of thy Tyrant's voice along
    The soft waves, once all musical to song,
    That heaved beneath the moonlight with the throng
    Of gondolas[237]--and to the busy hum
    Of cheerful creatures, whose most sinful deeds
    Were but the overbeating of the heart,
    And flow of too much happiness, which needs
    The aid of age to turn its course apart
    From the luxuriant and voluptuous flood                             30
    Of sweet sensations, battling with the blood.
    But these are better than the gloomy errors,
    The weeds of nations in their last decay,
    When Vice walks forth with her unsoftened terrors,
    And Mirth is madness, and but smiles to slay;
    And Hope is nothing but a false delay,
    The sick man's lightning half an hour ere Death,
    When Faintness, the last mortal birth of Pain,
    And apathy of limb, the dull beginning
    Of the cold staggering race which Death is winning,                 40
    Steals vein by vein and pulse by pulse away;
    Yet so relieving the o'er-tortured clay,
    To him appears renewal of his breath,
    And freedom the mere numbness of his chain;
    And then he talks of Life, and how again
    He feels his spirit soaring--albeit weak,
    And of the fresher air, which he would seek;
    And as he whispers knows not that he gasps,
    That his thin finger feels not what it clasps,
    And so the film comes o'er him--and the dizzy                       50
    Chamber swims round and round--and shadows busy,
    At which he vainly catches, flit and gleam,
    Till the last rattle chokes the strangled scream,
    And all is ice and blackness,--and the earth
    That which it was the moment ere our birth.[238]

                        II.

    There is no hope for nations!--Search the page
      Of many thousand years--the daily scene,
    The flow and ebb of each recurring age,
      The everlasting _to be_ which _hath been_,
      Hath taught us nought or little: still we lean                    60
    On things that rot beneath our weight, and wear
    Our strength away in wrestling with the air;
    For't is our nature strikes us down: the beasts
    Slaughtered in hourly hecatombs for feasts
    Are of as high an order--they must go
    Even where their driver goads them, though to slaughter.
    Ye men, who pour your blood for kings as water,
    What have they given your children in return?
    A heritage of servitude and woes,
    A blindfold bondage, where your hire is blows.                      70
    What! do not yet the red-hot ploughshares burn,[239]
    O'er which you stumble in a false ordeal,
    And deem this proof of loyalty the _real_;
    Kissing the hand that guides you to your scars,
    And glorying as you tread the glowing bars?
    All that your Sires have left you, all that Time
    Bequeaths of free, and History of sublime,
    Spring from a different theme!--Ye see and read,
    Admire and sigh, and then succumb and bleed!
    Save the few spirits who, despite of all,                           80
    And worse than all, the sudden crimes engendered
    By the down-thundering of the prison-wall,
    And thirst to swallow the sweet waters tendered,
    Gushing from Freedom's fountains--when the crowd,[240]
    Maddened with centuries of drought, are loud,
    And trample on each other to obtain
    The cup which brings oblivion of a chain
    Heavy and sore,--in which long yoked they ploughed
    The sand,--or if there sprung the yellow grain,
    'Twas not for them, their necks were too much bowed,                90
    And their dead palates chewed the cud of pain:--
    Yes! the few spirits--who, despite of deeds
    Which they abhor, confound not with the cause
    Those momentary starts from Nature's laws,
    Which, like the pestilence and earthquake, smite
    But for a term, then pass, and leave the earth
    With all her seasons to repair the blight
    With a few summers, and again put forth
    Cities and generations--fair, when free--
    For, Tyranny, there blooms no bud for thee!                        100

                        III.

    Glory and Empire! once upon these towers[241]
      With Freedom--godlike Triad! how you sate!
    The league of mightiest nations, in those hours
      When Venice was an envy, might abate,
      But did not quench, her spirit--in her fate
    All were enwrapped: the feasted monarchs knew
      And loved their hostess, nor could learn to hate,
    Although they humbled--with the kingly few
    The many felt, for from all days and climes
    She was the voyager's worship;--even her crimes                    110
    Were of the softer order, born of Love--
    She drank no blood, nor fattened on the dead,
    But gladdened where her harmless conquests spread;
    For these restored the Cross, that from above
    Hallowed her sheltering banners, which incessant
    Flew between earth and the unholy Crescent,[242]
    Which, if it waned and dwindled, Earth may thank
    The city it has clothed in chains, which clank
    Now, creaking in the ears of those who owe
    The name of Freedom to her glorious struggles;                     120
    Yet she but shares with them a common woe,
    And called the "kingdom"[243] of a conquering foe,--
    But knows what all--and, most of all, _we_ know--
    With what set gilded terms a tyrant juggles!

                        IV.

    The name of Commonwealth is past and gone
      O'er the three fractions of the groaning globe;
    Venice is crushed, and Holland deigns to own
      A sceptre, and endures the purple robe;[244]
    If the free Switzer yet bestrides alone
    His chainless mountains, 't is but for a time,                     130
    For Tyranny of late is cunning grown,
    And in its own good season tramples down
    The sparkles of our ashes. One great clime,
    Whose vigorous offspring by dividing ocean[245]
    Are kept apart and nursed in the devotion
    Of Freedom, which their fathers fought for, and
    Bequeathed--a heritage of heart and hand,
    And proud distinction from each other land,
    Whose sons must bow them at a Monarch's motion,
    As if his senseless sceptre were a wand                            140
    Full of the magic of exploded science--
    Still one great clime, in full and free defiance,
    Yet rears her crest, unconquered and sublime,
    Above the far Atlantic!--She has taught
    Her Esau-brethren that the haughty flag,
    The floating fence of Albion's feebler crag,[246]
    May strike to those whose red right hands have bought
    Rights cheaply earned with blood.--Still, still, for ever
    Better, though each man's life-blood were a river,
    That it should flow, and overflow, than creep                      150
    Through thousand lazy channels in our veins,
    Dammed like the dull canal with locks and chains,
    And moving, as a sick man in his sleep,
    Three paces, and then faltering:--better be
    Where the extinguished Spartans still are free,
    In their proud charnel of Thermopylæ,
    Than stagnate in our marsh,--or o'er the deep
    Fly, and one current to the ocean add,
    One spirit to the souls our fathers had,
    One freeman more, America, to thee![247]                           160

                        INTRODUCTION TO _MAZEPPA_

_Mazeppa_, a legend of the Russian Ukraine, or frontier region, is based
on the passage in Voltaire's _Charles XII_. prefixed as the
"Advertisement" to the poem. Voltaire seems to have known very little
about the man or his history, and Byron, though he draws largely on his
imagination, was content to take his substratum of fact from Voltaire.
The "true story of Mazeppa" is worth re-telling for its own sake, and
lends a fresh interest and vitality to the legend. Ivan Stepanovitch
Mazeppa (or Mazepa), born about the year 1645, was of Cossack origin,
but appears to have belonged, by descent or creation, to the lesser
nobility of the semi-Polish Volhynia. He began life (1660) as a page of
honour in the Court of King John Casimir V. of Poland, where he studied
Latin, and acquired the tongue and pen of eloquent statesmanship.
Banished from the court on account of a quarrel, he withdrew to his
mother's estate in Volhynia, and there, to beguile the time, made love
to the wife of a neighbouring magnate, the _pane_ or Lord Falbowski. The
intrigue was discovered, and to avenge his wrongs the outraged husband
caused Mazeppa to be stripped to the skin, and bound to his own steed.
The horse, lashed into madness, and terror-stricken by the discharge of
a pistol, started off at a gallop, and rushing "thorough bush, thorough
briar," carried his torn and bleeding rider into the courtyard of his
own mansion!

With regard to the sequel or issue of this episode, history is silent,
but when the curtain rises again (A.D. 1674) Mazeppa is discovered in
the character of writer-general or foreign secretary to Peter
Doroshénko, hetman or president of the Western Ukraine, on the hither
side of the Dniéper. From the service of Doroshénko, who came to an
untimely end, he passed by a series of accidents into the employ of his
rival, Samoïlovitch, hetman of the Eastern Ukraine, and, as his
secretary or envoy, continued to attract the notice and to conciliate
the good will of the (regent) Tzarina Sophia and her eminent _boyard_,
Prince Basil Golitsyn. A time came (1687) when it served the interests
of Russia to degrade Samoïlovitch, and raise Mazeppa to the post of
hetman, and thenceforward, for twenty years and more, he held something
like a regal sway over the whole of the Ukraine (a fertile "no-man's
land," watered by the Dniéper and its tributaries), openly the loyal and
zealous ally of his neighbour and suzerain, Peter the Great.

How far this allegiance was genuine, or whether a secret preference for
Poland, the land of his adoption, or a long-concealed impatience of
Muscovite suzerainty would in any case have urged him to revolt, must
remain doubtful, but it is certain that the immediate cause of a final
reversal of the allegiance and a break with the Tsar was a second and
still more fateful _affaire du coeur_. The hetman was upwards of sixty
years of age, but, even so, he fell in love with his god-daughter,
Matréna, who, in spite of difference of age and ecclesiastical kinship,
not only returned his love, but, to escape the upbraidings and
persecution of her mother, took refuge under his roof. Mazeppa sent the
girl back to her home, but, as his love-letters testify, continued to
woo her with the tenderest and most passionate solicitings; and,
although she finally yielded to _force majeure_ and married another
suitor, her parents nursed their revenge, and endeavoured to embroil the
hetman with the Tsar. For a time their machinations failed, and
Matréna's father, Kotchúbey, together with his friend Iskra, were
executed with the Tsar's assent and approbation. Before long, however,
Mazeppa, who had been for some time past in secret correspondence with
the Swedes, signalized his defection from Peter by offering his services
first to Stanislaus of Poland, and afterwards to Charles XII. of Sweden,
who was meditating the invasion of Russia.

"Pultowa's day," July 8, 1709, was the last of Mazeppa's power and
influence, and in the following year (March 31, 1710), "he died of old
age, perhaps of a broken heart," at Várnitza, a village near Bender, on
the Dniester, whither he had accompanied the vanquished and fugitive
Charles.

Such was Mazeppa, a man destined to pass through the crowded scenes of
history, and to take his stand among the greater heroes of romance. His
deeds of daring, his intrigues and his treachery, have been and still
are sung by the wandering minstrels of the Ukraine. His story has passed
into literature. His ride forms the subject of an _Orientale_ (1829) by
Victor Hugo, who treats Byron's theme symbolically; and the romance of
his old age, his love for his god-daughter Matréna, with its tragical
issue, the judicial murder of Kotchúbey and Iskra, are celebrated by the
"Russian Byron" Pushkin, in his poem _Poltava_. He forms the subject of
a novel, _Iwan Wizigin_, by Bulgarin, 1830, and of tragedies by I.
Slowacki, 1840, and Rudolph von Gottschall. From literature Mazeppa has
passed into art in the "symphonic poem" of Franz Lizt (1857); and, yet
again, _pour comble de gloire_, _Mazeppa, or The Wild Horse of Tartary_,
is the title of a "romantic drama," first played at the Royal
Amphitheatre, Westminster Bridge, on Easter Monday, 1831; and revived at
Astley's Theatre, when Adah Isaacs Menken appeared as "Mazeppa," October
3, 1864. (_Peter the Great_, by Eugene Schuyler, 1884, ii. 115, _seq_.;
_Le Fils de Pierre Le Grand, Mazeppa, etc_., by Viscount E. Melchior de
Vogüé, Paris, 1884; _Peter the Great_, by Oscar Browning, 1899, pp.
219-229.)

Of the composition of Mazeppa we know nothing, except that on September
24, 1818, "it was still to finish" (_Letters_, 1900, iv. 264). It was
published together with an _Ode_ (_Venice: An Ode_) and _A Fragment_
(see _Letters_, 1899, iii. Appendix IV. pp. 446-453), June 28, 1819.

Notices of _Mazeppa_ appeared in _Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine_, July,
1819, vol. v. p. 429 (for _John Gilpin_ and _Mazeppa_, by William
Maginn, _vide ibid_., pp. 434-439); the _Monthly Review_, July, 1819,
vol. 89, pp. 309-321; and the _Eclectic Review_, August, 1819, vol. xii.
pp. 147-156.

"Celui qui remplissait alors cette place était un gentilhomme Polonais,
nominé Mazeppa, né dans le palatinat de Podolie: il avait été élevé page
de Jean Casimir, et avait pris à sa cour quelque teinture des
belles-lettres. Une intrigue qu'il eut dans sa jeunesse avec la femme
d'un gentilhomme Polonais ayant été découverte, le mari le fit lier tout
nu sur un cheval farouche, et le laissa aller en cet état. Le cheval,
qui était du pays de l'Ukraine, y retourna, et y porta Mazeppa,
demi-mort de fatigue et de faim. Quelques paysans le secoururent: il
resta longtems parmi eux, et se signala dans plusieurs courses contre
les Tartares. La supériorité de ses lumières lui donna une grande
considération parmi les Cosaques: sa réputation s'augmentant de jour en
jour, obligea le Czar à le faire Prince de l'Ukraine."--Voltaire, _Hist.
de Charles XII_., 1772, p. 205.

"Le roi, fuyant et poursuivi, eut son cheval tué sous lui; le Colonel
Gieta, blessé, et perdant tout son sang, lui donna le sien. Ainsi on
remit deux fois à cheval, dans la fuite,[br] ce conquérant qui n'avait
pu y monter pendant la bataille."--p. 222.

"Le roi alla par un autre chemin avec quelques cavaliers. Le carrosse,
où il était, rompit dans la marche; on le remit à cheval. Pour comble de
disgrâce, il s'égara pendant la nuit dans un bois; là, son courage ne
pouvant plus suppléer, à ses forces épuisées, les douleurs de sa
blessure devenues plus insupportables par la fatigue, son cheval étant
tombé de lassitude, il se coucha quelques heures au pied d'un arbre, en
danger d'être surpris à tout moment par les vainqueurs, qui le
cherchaient de tous côtés."--p. 224.

                        I.

    'Twas after dread Pultowa's day,[248]
      When Fortune left the royal Swede--
    Around a slaughtered army lay,
      No more to combat and to bleed.
    The power and glory of the war,
      Faithless as their vain votaries, men,
    Had passed to the triumphant Czar,
      And Moscow's walls were safe again--
    Until a day more dark and drear,[249]
    And a more memorable year,                                          10
    Should give to slaughter and to shame
    A mightier host and haughtier name;
    A greater wreck, a deeper fall,
    A shock to one--a thunderbolt to all.

                        II.

    Such was the hazard of the die;
    The wounded Charles was taught to fly[250]
    By day and night through field and flood,
    Stained with his own and subjects' blood;
    For thousands fell that flight to aid:
    And not a voice was heard to upbraid                                20
    Ambition in his humbled hour,
    When Truth had nought to dread from Power.
    His horse was slain, and Gieta gave
    His own--and died the Russians' slave.
    This, too, sinks after many a league
    Of well-sustained, but vain fatigue;
    And in the depth of forests darkling,
    The watch-fires in the distance sparkling--
      The beacons of surrounding foes--
    A King must lay his limbs at length.                                30
      Are these the laurels and repose
    For which the nations strain their strength?
    They laid him by a savage tree,[251]
    In outworn Nature's agony;
    His wounds were stiff, his limbs were stark;
    The heavy hour was chill and dark;
    The fever in his blood forbade
    A transient slumber's fitful aid:
    And thus it was; but yet through all,
    Kinglike the monarch bore his fall,                                 40
    And made, in this extreme of ill,
    His pangs the vassals of his will:
    All silent and subdued were they.
    As once the nations round him lay.

                        III.

    A band of chiefs!--alas! how few,
      Since but the fleeting of a day
    Had thinned it; but this wreck was true
      And chivalrous: upon the clay
    Each sate him down, all sad and mute,
      Beside his monarch and his steed;                                 50
    For danger levels man and brute,
      And all are fellows in their need.
    Among the rest, Mazeppa made[252]
    His pillow in an old oak's shade--
    Himself as rough, and scarce less old,
    The Ukraine's Hetman, calm and bold;
    But first, outspent with this long course,
    The Cossack prince rubbed down his horse,
    And made for him a leafy bed,
      And smoothed his fetlocks and his mane,                           60
      And slacked his girth, and stripped his rein,
    And joyed to see how well he fed;
    For until now he had the dread
    His wearied courser might refuse
    To browse beneath the midnight dews:
    But he was hardy as his lord,
    And little cared for bed and board;
    But spirited and docile too,
    Whate'er was to be done, would do.
    Shaggy and swift, and strong of limb,                               70
    All Tartar-like he carried him;
    Obeyed his voice, and came to call,
    And knew him in the midst of all:
    Though thousands were around,--and Night,
    Without a star, pursued her flight,--
    That steed from sunset until dawn
    His chief would follow like a fawn.


                        IV.

    This done, Mazeppa spread his cloak,
    And laid his lance beneath his oak,
    Felt if his arms in order good                                      80
    The long day's march had well withstood--
    If still the powder filled the pan,
      And flints unloosened kept their lock--
    His sabre's hilt and scabbard felt,
    And whether they had chafed his belt;
    And next the venerable man,
    From out his havresack and can,
      Prepared and spread his slender stock;
    And to the Monarch and his men
    The whole or portion offered then                                   90
    With far less of inquietude
    Than courtiers at a banquet would.
    And Charles of this his slender share
    With smiles partook a moment there,
    To force of cheer a greater show,
    And seem above both wounds and woe;--
    And then he said--"Of all our band,
    Though firm of heart and strong of hand,
    In skirmish, march, or forage, none
    Can less have said or more have done                               100
    Than thee, Mazeppa! On the earth
    So fit a pair had never birth,
    Since Alexander's days till now,
    As thy Bucephalus and thou:
    All Scythia's fame to thine should yield
    For pricking on o'er flood and field."
    Mazeppa answered--"Ill betide
    The school wherein I learned to ride!"
    Quoth Charles--"Old Hetman, wherefore so,
    Since thou hast learned the art so well?"                          110
    Mazeppa said--"'Twere long to tell;
    And we have many a league to go,
    With every now and then a blow,
    And ten to one at least the foe,
    Before our steeds may graze at ease,
    Beyond the swift Borysthenes:[253]
    And, Sire, your limbs have need of rest,
    And I will be the sentinel
    Of this your troop."--"But I request,"
    Said Sweden's monarch, "thou wilt tell                             120
    This tale of thine, and I may reap,
    Perchance, from this the boon of sleep;
    For at this moment from my eyes
    The hope of present slumber flies."

    "Well, Sire, with such a hope, I'll track
    My seventy years of memory back:
    I think 'twas in my twentieth spring,--
    Aye 'twas,--when Casimir was king[254]--
    John Casimir,--I was his page
    Six summers, in my earlier age:[255]                               130
    A learnéd monarch, faith! was he,
    And most unlike your Majesty;
    He made no wars, and did not gain
    New realms to lose them back again;
    And (save debates in Warsaw's diet)
    He reigned in most unseemly quiet;
    Not that he had no cares to vex;
    He loved the Muses and the Sex;[256]
    And sometimes these so froward are,
    They made him wish himself at war;                                 140
    But soon his wrath being o'er, he took
    Another mistress--or new book:
    And then he gave prodigious fetes--
    All Warsaw gathered round his gates
    To gaze upon his splendid court,
    And dames, and chiefs, of princely port.
    He was the Polish Solomon,
    So sung his poets, all but one,
    Who, being unpensioned, made a satire,
    And boasted that he could not flatter.                             150
    It was a court of jousts and mimes,
    Where every courtier tried at rhymes;
    Even I for once produced some verses,
    And signed my odes 'Despairing Thyrsis.'
    There was a certain Palatine,[257]
      A Count of far and high descent,
    Rich as a salt or silver mine;[258]
    And he was proud, ye may divine,
      As if from Heaven he had been sent;
    He had such wealth in blood and ore                                160
      As few could match beneath the throne;
    And he would gaze upon his store,
    And o'er his pedigree would pore,
    Until by some confusion led,
    Which almost looked like want of head,
      He thought their merits were his own.
    His wife was not of this opinion;
      His junior she by thirty years,
    Grew daily tired of his dominion;
      And, after wishes, hopes, and fears,                             170
      To Virtue a few farewell tears,
    A restless dream or two--some glances
    At Warsaw's youth--some songs, and dances,
    Awaited but the usual chances,
    Those happy accidents which render
    The coldest dames so very tender,
    To deck her Count with titles given,
    'Tis said, as passports into Heaven;
    But, strange to say, they rarely boast
    Of these, who have deserved them most.                             180

                        V.

    "I was a goodly stripling then;
      At seventy years I so may say,
    That there were few, or boys or men,
      Who, in my dawning time of day,
    Of vassal or of knight's degree,
    Could vie in vanities with me;
    For I had strength--youth--gaiety,
    A port, not like to this ye see,
    But smooth, as all is rugged now;
      For Time, and Care, and War, have ploughed                       190
    My very soul from out my brow;
      And thus I should be disavowed
    By all my kind and kin, could they
    Compare my day and yesterday;
    This change was wrought, too, long ere age
    Had ta'en my features for his page:
    With years, ye know, have not declined
    My strength--my courage--or my mind,
    Or at this hour I should not be
    Telling old tales beneath a tree,                                  200
    With starless skies my canopy.
      But let me on: Theresa's[259] form--
    Methinks it glides before me now,
    Between me and yon chestnut's bough,
      The memory is so quick and warm;
    And yet I find no words to tell
    The shape of her I loved so well:
    She had the Asiatic eye,
      Such as our Turkish neighbourhood
      Hath mingled with our Polish blood,                              210
    Dark as above us is the sky;
    But through it stole a tender light,
    Like the first moonrise of midnight;
    Large, dark, and swimming in the stream,
    Which seemed to melt to its own beam;
    All love, half languor, and half fire,
    Like saints that at the stake expire,
    And lift their raptured looks on high,
    As though it were a joy to die.[bs]
    A brow like a midsummer lake,                                      220
      Transparent with the sun therein,
    When waves no murmur dare to make,
      And heaven beholds her face within.
    A cheek and lip--but why proceed?
      I loved her then, I love her still;
    And such as I am, love indeed
      In fierce extremes--in good and ill.
    But still we love even in our rage,
    And haunted to our very age
    With the vain shadow of the past,--                                230
    As is Mazeppa to the last.

                        VI.

    "We met--we gazed--I saw, and sighed;
    She did not speak, and yet replied;
    There are ten thousand tones and signs
    We hear and see, but none defines--
    Involuntary sparks of thought,
    Which strike from out the heart o'erwrought,
    And form a strange intelligence,
    Alike mysterious and intense,
    Which link the burning chain that binds,                           240
    Without their will, young hearts and minds;
    Conveying, as the electric[260] wire,
    We know not how, the absorbing fire.
    I saw, and sighed--in silence wept,
    And still reluctant distance kept,
    Until I was made known to her,
    And we might then and there confer
    Without suspicion--then, even then,
      I longed, and was resolved to speak;
    But on my lips they died again,                                    250
      The accents tremulous and weak,
    Until one hour.--There is a game,
      A frivolous and foolish play,
      Wherewith we while away the day;
    It is--I have forgot the name--
    And we to this, it seems, were set,
    By some strange chance, which I forget:
    I recked not if I won or lost,
      It was enough for me to be
      So near to hear, and oh! to see                                  260
    The being whom I loved the most.
    I watched her as a sentinel,
    (May ours this dark night watch as well!)
      Until I saw, and thus it was,
    That she was pensive, nor perceived
    Her occupation, nor was grieved
    Nor glad to lose or gain; but still
    Played on for hours, as if her will
    Yet bound her to the place, though not
    That hers might be the winning lot[bt].                            270
      Then through my brain the thought did pass,
    Even as a flash of lightning there,
    That there was something in her air
    Which would not doom me to despair;
    And on the thought my words broke forth,
      All incoherent as they were;
    Their eloquence was little worth,
    But yet she listened--'tis enough--
      Who listens once will listen twice;
      Her heart, be sure, is not of ice--                              280
    And one refusal no rebuff.

                        VII.

    "I loved, and was beloved again--
      They tell me, Sire, you never knew
      Those gentle frailties; if 'tis true,
    I shorten all my joy or pain;
    To you 'twould seem absurd as vain;
    But all men are not born to reign,
    Or o'er their passions, or as you
    Thus o'er themselves and nations too.
    I am--or rather _was_--a Prince,                                   290
      A chief of thousands, and could lead
      Them on where each would foremost bleed;
    But could not o'er myself evince
    The like control--But to resume:
      I loved, and was beloved again;
    In sooth, it is a happy doom,
      But yet where happiest ends in pain.--
    We met in secret, and the hour
    Which led me to that lady's bower
    Was fiery Expectation's dower.                                     300
    My days and nights were nothing--all
    Except that hour which doth recall,
    In the long lapse from youth to age,
      No other like itself: I'd give
      The Ukraine back again to live
    It o'er once more, and be a page,
    The happy page, who was the lord
    Of one soft heart, and his own sword,
    And had no other gem nor wealth,
    Save Nature's gift of Youth and Health.                            310
    We met in secret--doubly sweet[261],
    Some say, they find it so to meet;
    I know not that--I would have given
      My life but to have called her mine
    In the full view of Earth and Heaven;
      For I did oft and long repine
    That we could only meet by stealth.

                        VIII.

    "For lovers there are many eyes,
      And such there were on us; the Devil
      On such occasions should be civil--                              320
    The Devil!--I'm loth to do him wrong,
      It might be some untoward saint,
    Who would not be at rest too long,
      But to his pious bile gave vent--
    But one fair night, some lurking spies
    Surprised and seized us both.
    The Count was something more than wroth--
    I was unarmed; but if in steel,
    All cap-à-pie from head to heel,
    What 'gainst their numbers could I do?                             330
    'Twas near his castle, far away
      From city or from succour near,
    And almost on the break of day;
    I did not think to see another,
      My moments seemed reduced to few;
    And with one prayer to Mary Mother,
      And, it may be, a saint or two,
    As I resigned me to my fate,
    They led me to the castle gate:
      Theresa's doom I never knew,                                     340
    Our lot was henceforth separate.
    An angry man, ye may opine,
    Was he, the proud Count Palatine;
    And he had reason good to be,
      But he was most enraged lest such
      An accident should chance to touch
    Upon his future pedigree;
    Nor less amazed, that such a blot
    His noble 'scutcheon should have got,
    While he was highest of his line;                                  350
      Because unto himself he seemed
      The first of men, nor less he deemed
    In others' eyes, and most in mine.
    'Sdeath! with a _page_--perchance a king
    Had reconciled him to the thing;
    But with a stripling of a page--
    I felt--but cannot paint his rage.

                        IX.

    "'Bring forth the horse!'--the horse was brought!
    In truth, he was a noble steed,
      A Tartar of the Ukraine breed,                                   360
    Who looked as though the speed of thought
    Were in his limbs; but he was wild,
      Wild as the wild deer, and untaught,
    With spur and bridle undefiled--
      'Twas but a day he had been caught;
    And snorting, with erected mane,
    And struggling fiercely, but in vain,
    In the full foam of wrath and dread
    To me the desert-born was led:
    They bound me on, that menial throng,
    Upon his back with many a thong;                                   370
    They loosed him with a sudden lash--
    Away!--away!--and on we dash!--
    Torrents less rapid and less rash.

                        X.

    "Away!--away!--My breath was gone,
    I saw not where he hurried on:
    'Twas scarcely yet the break of day,
    And on he foamed--away!--away!
    The last of human sounds which rose,
    As I was darted from my foes,                                      380
    Was the wild shout of savage laughter,
    Which on the wind came roaring after
    A moment from that rabble rout:
    With sudden wrath I wrenched my head,
      And snapped the cord, which to the mane
      Had bound my neck in lieu of rein,
    And, writhing half my form about,
    Howled back my curse; but 'midst the tread,
    The thunder of my courser's speed,
    Perchance they did not hear nor heed:                              390
    It vexes me--for I would fain
    Have paid their insult back again.
    I paid it well in after days:
    There is not of that castle gate,
    Its drawbridge and portcullis' weight,
    Stone--bar--moat--bridge--or barrier left;
    Nor of its fields a blade of grass,
      Save what grows on a ridge of wall,
      Where stood the hearth-stone of the hall;
    And many a time ye there might pass,                               400
    Nor dream that e'er the fortress was.
    I saw its turrets in a blaze,
    Their crackling battlements all cleft,
      And the hot lead pour down like rain
    From off the scorched and blackening roof,
    Whose thickness was not vengeance-proof.
      They little thought that day of pain,
    When launched, as on the lightning's flash,
    They bade me to destruction dash,
      That one day I should come again,                                410
    With twice five thousand horse, to thank
      The Count for his uncourteous ride.
    They played me then a bitter prank,
      When, with the wild horse for my guide,
    They bound me to his foaming flank:
    At length I played them one as frank--
    For Time at last sets all things even--
      And if we do but watch the hour,
      There never yet was human power
    Which could evade, if unforgiven,                                  420
    The patient search and vigil long
    Of him who treasures up a wrong.

                        XI.

    "Away!--away!--my steed and I,
      Upon the pinions of the wind!
      All human dwellings left behind,
    We sped like meteors through the sky,
    When with its crackling sound the night[262]
    Is chequered with the Northern light.
    Town--village--none were on our track,
      But a wild plain of far extent,                                  430
    And bounded by a forest black[263];
      And, save the scarce seen battlement
    On distant heights of some strong hold,
    Against the Tartars built of old,
    No trace of man. The year before
    A Turkish army had marched o'er;
    And where the Spahi's hoof hath trod,
    The verdure flies the bloody sod:
    The sky was dull, and dim, and gray,
      And a low breeze crept moaning by--                              440
      I could have answered with a sigh--
    But fast we fled,--away!--away!--
    And I could neither sigh nor pray;
    And my cold sweat-drops fell like rain
    Upon the courser's bristling mane;
    But, snorting still with rage and fear,
    He flew upon his far career:
    At times I almost thought, indeed,
    He must have slackened in his speed;
    But no--my bound and slender frame                                 450
      Was nothing to his angry might,
    And merely like a spur became:
    Each motion which I made to free
    My swoln limbs from their agony
      Increased his fury and affright:
    I tried my voice,--'twas faint and low--
    But yet he swerved as from a blow;
    And, starting to each accent, sprang
    As from a sudden trumpet's clang:
    Meantime my cords were wet with gore,                              460
    Which, oozing through my limbs, ran o'er;
    And in my tongue the thirst became
    A something fierier far than flame.

                        XII.

    "We neared the wild wood--'twas so wide,
    I saw no bounds on either side:
    'Twas studded with old sturdy trees,
    That bent not to the roughest breeze
    Which howls down from Siberia's waste,
    And strips the forest in its haste,--
    But these were few and far between,                                470
    Set thick with shrubs more young and green,
    Luxuriant with their annual leaves,
    Ere strown by those autumnal eyes
    That nip the forest's foliage dead,
    Discoloured with a lifeless red[bu],
    Which stands thereon like stiffened gore
    Upon the slain when battle's o'er;
    And some long winter's night hath shed
    Its frost o'er every tombless head--
    So cold and stark--the raven's beak                                480
    May peck unpierced each frozen cheek:
    'Twas a wild waste of underwood,
    And here and there a chestnut stood,
    The strong oak, and the hardy pine;
      But far apart--and well it were,
    Or else a different lot were mine--
      The boughs gave way, and did not tear
    My limbs; and I found strength to bear
    My wounds, already scarred with cold;
    My bonds forbade to loose my hold.                                 490
    We rustled through the leaves like wind,--
    Left shrubs, and trees, and wolves behind;
    By night I heard them on the track,
    Their troop came hard upon our back,
    With their long gallop, which can tire
    The hound's deep hate, and hunter's fire:
    Where'er we flew they followed on,
    Nor left us with the morning sun;
    Behind I saw them, scarce a rood,
    At day-break winding through the wood,                             500
    And through the night had heard their feet
    Their stealing, rustling step repeat.
    Oh! how I wished for spear or sword,
    At least to die amidst the horde,
    And perish--if it must be so--
    At bay, destroying many a foe!
    When first my courser's race begun,
    I wished the goal already won;
    But now I doubted strength and speed:
    Vain doubt! his swift and savage breed                             510
    Had nerved him like the mountain-roe--
    Nor faster falls the blinding snow
    Which whelms the peasant near the door
    Whose threshold he shall cross no more,
    Bewildered with the dazzling blast,
    Than through the forest-paths he passed--
    Untired, untamed, and worse than wild--
    All furious as a favoured child
    Balked of its wish; or--fiercer still--
    A woman piqued--who has her will!                                  520

                        XIII.

    "The wood was passed; 'twas more than noon,
    But chill the air, although in June;
    Or it might be my veins ran cold--
    Prolonged endurance tames the bold;
    And I was then not what I seem,
    But headlong as a wintry stream,
    And wore my feelings out before
    I well could count their causes o'er:
    And what with fury, fear, and wrath,
    The tortures which beset my path--                                 530
    Cold--hunger--sorrow--shame--distress--
    Thus bound in Nature's nakedness;
    Sprung from a race whose rising blood
    When stirred beyond its calmer mood,
    And trodden hard upon, is like
    The rattle-snake's, in act to strike--
    What marvel if this worn-out trunk
    Beneath its woes a moment sunk?[264]
    The earth gave way, the skies rolled round,
    I seemed to sink upon the ground;                                  540
    But erred--for I was fastly bound.
    My heart turned sick, my brain grew sore,
    And throbbed awhile, then beat no more:
    The skies spun like a mighty wheel;
    I saw the trees like drunkards reel,
    And a slight flash sprang o'er my eyes,
    Which saw no farther. He who dies
    Can die no more than then I died,
    O'ertortured by that ghastly ride.[265]
    I felt the blackness come and go,                                  550
      And strove to wake; but could not make
    My senses climb up from below:
    I felt as on a plank at sea,
    When all the waves that dash o'er thee,
    At the same time upheave and whelm,
    And hurl thee towards a desert realm.
    My undulating life was as
    The fancied lights that flitting pass
    Our shut eyes in deep midnight, when
    Fever begins upon the brain;                                       560
    But soon it passed, with little pain,
      But a confusion worse than such:
      I own that I should deem it much,
    Dying, to feel the same again;
    And yet I do suppose we must
    Feel far more ere we turn to dust!
    No matter! I have bared my brow
    Full in Death's face--before--and now.

                        XIV.

    "My thoughts came back. Where was I? Cold,
      And numb, and giddy: pulse by pulse                              570
    Life reassumed its lingering hold,
    And throb by throb,--till grown a pang
      Which for a moment would convulse,
      My blood reflowed, though thick and chill;
    My ear with uncouth noises rang,
      My heart began once more to thrill;
    My sight returned, though dim; alas!
    And thickened, as it were, with glass.
    Methought the dash of waves was nigh;
    There was a gleam too of the sky,                                  580
    Studded with stars;--it is no dream;
    The wild horse swims the wilder stream!
    The bright broad river's gushing tide
    Sweeps, winding onward, far and wide,
    And we are half-way, struggling o'er
    To yon unknown and silent shore.
    The waters broke my hollow trance,
    And with a temporary strength
      My stiffened limbs were rebaptized.
    My courser's broad breast proudly braves,                          590
    And dashes off the ascending waves,
    And onward we advance!
    We reach the slippery shore at length,
      A haven I but little prized,
    For all behind was dark and drear,
    And all before was night and fear.
    How many hours of night or day[266]
    In those suspended pangs I lay,
    I could not tell; I scarcely knew
    If this were human breath I drew.                                  600

                        XV.

    "With glossy skin, and dripping mane,
      And reeling limbs, and reeking flank,
    The wild steed's sinewy nerves still strain
      Up the repelling bank.
    We gain the top: a boundless plain
    Spreads through the shadow of the night,
      And onward, onward, onward--seems,
      Like precipices in our dreams,[267]
    To stretch beyond the sight;
    And here and there a speck of white,                               610
      Or scattered spot of dusky green,
    In masses broke into the light,
    As rose the moon upon my right:
      But nought distinctly seen
    In the dim waste would indicate
    The omen of a cottage gate;
    No twinkling taper from afar
    Stood like a hospitable star;
    Not even an ignis-fatuus rose[268]
    To make him merry with my woes:                                    620
      That very cheat had cheered me then!
    Although detected, welcome still,
    Reminding me, through every ill,
      Of the abodes of men.

                        XVI.

    "Onward we went--but slack and slow;
      His savage force at length o'erspent,
    The drooping courser, faint and low,
      All feebly foaming went:
    A sickly infant had had power
    To guide him forward in that hour!                                 630
      But, useless all to me,
    His new-born tameness nought availed--
    My limbs were bound; my force had failed,
      Perchance, had they been free.
    With feeble effort still I tried
    To rend the bonds so starkly tied,
      But still it was in vain;
    My limbs were only wrung the more,
    And soon the idle strife gave o'er,
      Which but prolonged their pain.                                  640
    The dizzy race seemed almost done,
    Although no goal was nearly won:
    Some streaks announced the coming sun--
      How slow, alas! he came!
    Methought that mist of dawning gray
    Would never dapple into day,
    How heavily it rolled away!
      Before the eastern flame
    Rose crimson, and deposed the stars,
    And called the radiance from their cars,[bv]                       650
    And filled the earth, from his deep throne,
    With lonely lustre, all his own.

                        XVII.

    "Uprose the sun; the mists were curled
    Back from the solitary world
    Which lay around--behind--before.
    What booted it to traverse o'er
    Plain--forest--river? Man nor brute,
    Nor dint of hoof, nor print of foot,
    Lay in the wild luxuriant soil--
    No sign of travel, none of toil--                                  660
    The very air was mute:
    And not an insect's shrill small horn,[269]
    Nor matin bird's new voice was borne
    From herb nor thicket. Many a _werst,_
    Panting as if his heart would burst,
    The weary brute still staggered on;
    And still we were--or seemed--alone:
    At length, while reeling on our way,
    Methought I heard a courser neigh,
    From out yon tuft of blackening firs.                              670
    Is it the wind those branches stirs?[270]
    No, no! from out the forest prance
      A trampling troop; I see them come!
    In one vast squadron they advance!
      I strove to cry--my lips were dumb!
    The steeds rush on in plunging pride;
    But where are they the reins to guide?
    A thousand horse, and none to ride!
    With flowing tail, and flying mane,
    Wide nostrils never stretched by pain,                             680
    Mouths bloodless to the bit or rein,
    And feet that iron never shod,
    And flanks unscarred by spur or rod,
    A thousand horse, the wild, the free,
    Like waves that follow o'er the sea,
      Came thickly thundering on,
    As if our faint approach to meet!
    The sight re-nerved my courser's feet,
    A moment staggering, feebly fleet,
    A moment, with a faint low neigh,                                  690
      He answered, and then fell!
    With gasps and glazing eyes he lay,
      And reeking limbs immoveable,
        His first and last career is done!
    On came the troop--they saw him stoop,
      They saw me strangely bound along
      His back with many a bloody thong.
    They stop--they start--they snuff the air,
    Gallop a moment here and there,
    Approach, retire, wheel round and round,                           700
    Then plunging back with sudden bound,
    Headed by one black mighty steed,
    Who seemed the Patriarch of his breed,
      Without a single speck or hair
    Of white upon his shaggy hide;
    They snort--they foam--neigh--swerve aside,
    And backward to the forest fly,
    By instinct, from a human eye.
      They left me there to my despair,
    Linked to the dead and stiffening wretch,                          710
    Whose lifeless limbs beneath me stretch,
    Relieved from that unwonted weight,
    From whence I could not extricate
    Nor him nor me--and there we lay,
      The dying on the dead!
    I little deemed another day
      Would see my houseless, helpless head.

    "And there from morn to twilight bound,
    I felt the heavy hours toil round,
    With just enough of life to see                                    720
    My last of suns go down on me,
    In hopeless certainty of, mind,
    That makes us feel at length resigned
    To that which our foreboding years
    Present the worst and last of fears:
    Inevitable--even a boon,
    Nor more unkind for coming soon,
    Yet shunned and dreaded with such care,
    As if it only were a snare
      That Prudence might escape:                                      730
    At times both wished for and implored,
    At times sought with self-pointed sword,
    Yet still a dark and hideous close
    To even intolerable woes,
      And welcome in no shape.
    And, strange to say, the sons of pleasure,
    They who have revelled beyond measure
    In beauty, wassail, wine, and treasure,
    Die calm, or calmer, oft than he
    Whose heritage was Misery.                                         740
    For he who hath in turn run through
    All that was beautiful and new,
      Hath nought to hope, and nought to leave;
    And, save the future, (which is viewed
    Not quite as men are base or good,
    But as their nerves may be endued,)
      With nought perhaps to grieve:
    The wretch still hopes his woes must end,
    And Death, whom he should deem his friend,
    Appears, to his distempered eyes,                                  750
    Arrived to rob him of his prize,
    The tree of his new Paradise.
    To-morrow would have given him all,
    Repaid his pangs, repaired his fall;
    To-morrow would have been the first
    Of days no more deplored or curst,
    But bright, and long, and beckoning years,
    Seen dazzling through the mist of tears,
    Guerdon of many a painful hour;
    To-morrow would have given him power                               760
    To rule--to shine--to smite--to save--
    And must it dawn upon his grave?

                        XVIII.

    "The sun was sinking--still I lay
      Chained to the chill and stiffening steed!
    I thought to mingle there our clay;[271]
      And my dim eyes of death had need,
      No hope arose of being freed.
    I cast my last looks up the sky,
      And there between me and the sun[272]
    I saw the expecting raven fly,                                     770
    Who scarce would wait till both should die,
      Ere his repast begun;[273]
    He flew, and perched, then flew once more,
    And each time nearer than before;
    I saw his wing through twilight flit,
    And once so near me he alit
      I could have smote, but lacked the strength;
    But the slight motion of my hand,
    And feeble scratching of the sand,
    The exerted throat's faint struggling noise,                       780
    Which scarcely could be called a voice,
      Together scared him off at length.
    I know no more--my latest dream
      Is something of a lovely star
      Which fixed my dull eyes from afar,
    And went and came with wandering beam,
    And of the cold--dull--swimming--dense
    Sensation of recurring sense,
    And then subsiding back to death,
    And then again a little breath,                                    790
    A little thrill--a short suspense,
      An icy sickness curdling o'er
    My heart, and sparks that crossed my brain--
    A gasp--a throb--a start of pain,
      A sigh--and nothing more.

                        XIX.

    "I woke--where was I?--Do I see
    A human face look down on me?
    And doth a roof above me close?
    Do these limbs on a couch repose?
    Is this a chamber where I lie?                                     800
    And is it mortal yon bright eye,
    That watches me with gentle glance?
      I closed my own again once more,
    As doubtful that my former trance
      Could not as yet be o'er.
    A slender girl, long-haired, and tall,
    Sate watching by the cottage wall.
    The sparkle of her eye I caught,
    Even with my first return of thought;
    For ever and anon she threw                                        810
      A prying, pitying glance on me
      With her black eyes so wild and free:
    I gazed, and gazed, until I knew
      No vision it could be,--
    But that I lived, and was released
    From adding to the vulture's feast:
    And when the Cossack maid beheld
    My heavy eyes at length unsealed,
    She smiled--and I essayed to speak,
      But failed--and she approached, and made                         820
      With lip and finger signs that said,
    I must not strive as yet to break
    The silence, till my strength should be
    Enough to leave my accents free;
    And then her hand on mine she laid,
    And smoothed the pillow for my head,
    And stole along on tiptoe tread,
      And gently oped the door, and spake
    In whispers--ne'er was voice so sweet![274]
    Even music followed her light feet.                                830
      But those she called were not awake,
    And she went forth; but, ere she passed,
    Another look on me she cast,
      Another sign she made, to say,
    That I had nought to fear, that all
    Were near, at my command or call,
      And she would not delay
    Her due return:--while she was gone,
    Methought I felt too much alone.

                        XX.

    "She came with mother and with sire--                              840
    What need of more?--I will not tire
    With long recital of the rest,
    Since I became the Cossack's guest.
    They found me senseless on the plain,
      They bore me to the nearest hut,
    They brought me into life again--
    Me--one day o'er their realm to reign!
      Thus the vain fool who strove to glut
    His rage, refining on my pain,
      Sent me forth to the wilderness,                                 850
    Bound--naked--bleeding--and alone,
    To pass the desert to a throne,--
      What mortal his own doom may guess?
      Let none despond, let none despair!
    To-morrow the Borysthenes
    May see our coursers graze at ease
    Upon his Turkish bank,--and never
    Had I such welcome for a river
      As I shall yield when safely there.[275]
    Comrades, good night!"--The Hetman threw                           860
      His length beneath the oak-tree shade,
      With leafy couch already made--
    A bed nor comfortless nor new
    To him, who took his rest whene'er
    The hour arrived, no matter where:
      His eyes the hastening slumbers steep.
    And if ye marvel Charles forgot
    To thank his tale, _he_ wondered not,--
      The King had been an hour asleep!

[248] {207}[The Battle of Poltáva on the Vórskla took place July 8,
1709. "The Swedish troops (under Rehnskjöld) numbered only 12,500
men.... The Russian army was four times as numerous.... The Swedes
seemed at first to get the advantage, ... but everywhere the were
overpowered and surrounded--beaten in detail; and though for two hours
they fought with the fierceness of despair, they were forced either to
surrender or to flee.... Over 2800 officers and men were taken
prisoners."--_Peter the Great_, by Eugene Schuyler, 1884, ii. 148, 149.]

the night of July 7, 1709 ... Charles had the foot carefully dressed,
while he wore a spurred boot on his sound foot, put on his uniform, and
placed himself on a kind of litter, in which he was drawn before the
lines of the array.... [After the battle, July 8] those who survived
took refuge in flight, the King--whose litter had been smashed by a
cannon-ball, and who was carried by the soldiers on crossed poles--going
with them, and the Russians neglecting to pursue. In this manner they
reached their former camp."--_Charles XII._, by Oscar Browning, 1899,

[253] {211}[The Dniéper.]

[254] [John Casimir (1609-1672), Jesuit, cardinal, and king, was a
Little-Polander, not to say a pro-Cossack, and suffered in consequence.
At the time of his proclamation as King of Poland, November, 1649,
Poland was threatened by an incursion of Cossacks. The immediate cause
was, or was supposed to be, the ill treatment which [Bogdán Khmelnítzky]
a Lithuanian had received at the hands of the Polish governor,
Czaplinski. The governor, it was alleged, had carried off, ravished, and
put to death Khmelnítzky's wife, and, not content with this outrage, had
set fire to the house of the Cossack, "in which perished his infant son
in his cradle." Others affirmed that the Cossack had begun the strife by
causing the governor "to be publicly and ignominiously whipped," and
that it was the Cossack's mill and not his house which he burnt. Be that
as it may, Casimir, on being exhorted to take the field, declined, on
the ground that the Poles "ought not to have set fire to Khmelnítzky's
house." It is probably to this unpatriotic determination to look at both
sides of the question that he earned the character of being an unwarlike
prince. As a matter of fact, he fought and was victorious against the
Cossacks and Tartars at Bereteskow and elsewhere. (See _Mod. Univ.
Hist._, xxxiv. 203, 217; Puffend, _Hist. Gener._, 1732, iv. 328; and
_Histoire des Kosaques_, par M. (Charles Louis) Le Sur, 1814, i. 321.)]

[255] [A.D. 1660 or thereabouts.]

[256] {212}[According to the editor of Voltaire's Works (_Oeuvres_,
Beuchot, 1830, xix. 378, note 1), there was a report that Casimir, after
his retirement to Paris in 1670, secretly married "_Marie Mignot, fille
d'une blanchisseuse_;" and there are other tales of other loves, e.g.
Ninon de Lenclos.]

[257] [According to the biographers, Mazeppa's intrigue took place after
he had been banished from the court of Warsaw, and had retired to his
estate in Volhynia. The _pane_ [Lord] Falbowsky, the old husband of the
young wife, was a neighbouring magnate. It was a case of "love in
idlenesse."--_Vide ante_, "The Introduction to _Mazeppa_," p. 201.]

[258] This comparison of a "_salt_ mine" may, perhaps, be permitted to a
Pole, as the wealth of the country consists greatly in the salt mines.

[259] {213}[It is improbable that Byron, when he wrote these lines, was
thinking of Theresa Gamba, Countess Guiccioli. He met her for the first
time "in the autumn of 1818, three days after her marriage," but it was
not till April, 1819, that he made her acquaintance. (See _Life_, p.
393, and _Letters_, 1900, iv. 289.) The copy of _Mazeppa_ sent home to
Murray is in the Countess Guiccioli's handwriting, but the assertion
(see Byron's _Works_, 1832, xi. 178), that "it is impossible not to
suspect that the Poet had some circumstances of his own personal
history, when he portrayed the fair Polish _Theresa_, her faithful
lover, and the jealous rage of the old Count Palatine," is open to
question. It was Marianna Segati who had "large, black, Oriental eyes,
with that peculiar expression in them which is seen rarely among
_Europeans_ ... forehead remarkably good" (see lines 208-220); not
Theresa Guiccioli, who was a "blonde," with a "brilliant complexion and
blue eyes." (See Letters to Moore, November 17, 1816; and to Murray, May
6, 1819: _Letters_, 1900, iv. 8, 289, note 1.) Moreover, the "Maid of
Athens" was called Theresa. Dr. D. Englaender, in his exhaustive
monologue, _Lord Byron's Mazeppa_, pp. 48, sq., insists on the identity
of the Theresa of the poem with the Countess Guiccioli, but from this
contention the late Professor Kölbing (see _Englische Studien_, 1898,
vol. xxiv. pp 448-458) dissents.]

jusqu'au Borysthene, en tirant vers l'orient ce sont des marais, des
déserts, des forêts immenses" (_Oeuvres_, 1829, xxiv. 170). The
exquisite beauty of the virgin steppes, the long rich grass, the
wild-flowers, the "diviner air," to which the Viscount de Vogüé
testifies so eloquently in his _Mazeppa_, were not in the "mind's eye"

                 INTRODUCTION TO _THE PROPHECY OF DANTE_.


The _Prophecy of Dante_ was written at Ravenna, during the month of
June, 1819, "to gratify" the Countess Guiccioli. Before she left Venice
in April she had received a promise from Byron to visit her at Ravenna.
"Dante's tomb, the classical pinewood," and so forth, had afforded a
pretext for the invitation to be given and accepted, and, at length,
when she was, as she imagined, "at the point of death," he arrived,
better late than never, "on the Festival of the _Corpus Domini_" which
fell that year on the tenth of June (see her communication to Moore,
_Life_, p. 399). Horses and books were left behind at Venice, but he
could occupy his enforced leisure by "writing something on the subject
of Dante" (_ibid_., p. 402). A heightened interest born of fuller
knowledge, in Italian literature and Italian politics, lent zest to this
labour of love, and, time and place conspiring, he composed "the best
thing he ever wrote" (Letter to Murray, March 23, 1820, _Letters_, 1900,
iv. 422), his _Vision_ (or _Prophecy_) _of Dante_.

It would have been strange if Byron, who had sounded his _Lament_ over
the sufferings of Tasso, and who had become _de facto_ if not _de jure_
a naturalized Italian, had forborne to associate his name and fame with
the sacred memory of the "Gran padre Alighier." If there had been any
truth in Friedrich Schlegel's pronouncement, in a lecture delivered at
Vienna in 1814, "that at no time has the greatest and most national of
all Italian poets ever been much the favourite of his countrymen," the
reproach had become meaningless. As the sumptuous folio edition (4
vols.) of the _Divina Commedia_, published at Florence, 1817-19; a
quarto edition (4 vols.) published at Rome, 1815-17; a folio edition (3
vols.) published at Bologna 1819-21, to which the Conte Giovanni
Marchetti (_vide_ the Preface, _post_, p. 245) contributed his famous
excursus on the allegory in the First Canto of the _Inferno_, and
numerous other issues remain to testify, Dante's own countrymen were
eager "to pay honours almost divine" to his memory. "The last age,"
writes Hobhouse, in 1817 (note 18 to Canto IV. of _Childe Harold's
Pilgrimage_, _Poetical Works_, 1899, ii. 496), "seemed inclined to
undervalue him.... The present generation ... has returned to the
ancient worship, and the _Danteggiare_ of the northern Italians is
thought even indiscreet by the more moderate Tuscans." Dante was in the
air. As Byron wrote in his Diary (January 29, 1821), "Read Schlegel
[probably in a translation published at Edinburgh, 1818]. Not a
favourite! Why, they talk Dante, write Dante, and think and dream Dante
at this moment (1821), to an excess which would be ridiculous, but that
he deserves it."

There was, too, another reason why he was minded to write a poem "on the
subject of Dante." There was, at this time, a hope, if not a clear
prospect, of political change--of throwing off the yoke of the Bourbon,
of liberating Italy from the tyrant and the stranger. "Dante was the
poet of liberty. Persecution, exile, the dread of a foreign grave, could
not shake his principles" (Medwin, _Conversations_, 1824, p. 242). The
_Prophecy_ was "intended for the Italians," intended to foreshadow as in
a vision "liberty and the resurrection of Italy" (_ibid_., p. 241). As
he rode at twilight through the pine forest, or along "the silent shore
Which bounds Ravenna's immemorial wood," the undying past inspired him
with a vision of the future, delayed, indeed, for a time, "the flame
ending in smoke," but fulfilled after many days, a vision of a redeemed
and united Italy.

"The poem," he says, in the Preface, "may be considered as a metrical
experiment." In _Beppo_, and the two first cantos of _Don Juan_, he had
proved that the _ottava rima_ of the Italians, which Frere had been one
of the first to transplant, might grow and flourish in an alien soil,
and now, by way of a second venture, he proposed to acclimatize the
_terza rima_. He was under the impression that Hayley, whom he had held
up to ridicule as "for ever feeble, and for ever tame," had been the
first and last to try the measure in English; but of Hayley's excellent
translation of the three first cantos of the _Inferno_ (_vide post_, p.
244, note 1), praised but somewhat grudgingly praised by Southey, he had
only seen an extract, and of earlier experiments he was altogether
ignorant. As a matter of fact, many poets had already essayed, but
timidly and without perseverance, to "come to the test in the
metrification" of the _Divine Comedy_. Some twenty-seven lines, "the
sole example in English literature of that period, of the use of _terza
rima_, obviously copied from Dante" (_Complete Works of Chaucer_, by the
Rev. W. Skeat, 1894, i. 76, 261), are imbedded in Chaucer's _Compleint
to his Lady_. In the sixteenth century Sir Thomas Wyatt and Henry
Howard, Earl of Surrey ("Description of the restless state of a lover"),
"as novises newly sprung out of the schools of Dante, Ariosto, and
Petrarch" (Puttenham's _Art of Poesie_, 1589, pp. 48-50); and later
again, Daniel ("To the Lady Lucy, Countess of Bedford"), Ben Jonson, and
Milton (_Psalms_ ii., vi.) afford specimens of _terza rima_. There was,
too, one among Byron's contemporaries who had already made trial of the
metre in his _Prince Athanase_ (1817) and _The Woodman and the
Nightingale_ (1818), and who, shortly, in his _Ode to the West Wind_
(October, 1819, published 1820) was to prove that it was not impossible
to write English poetry, if not in genuine _terza rima_, with its
interchange of double rhymes, at least in what has been happily styled
the "Byronic _terza rima_." It may, however, be taken for granted that,
at any rate in June, 1819, these fragments of Shelley's were unknown to
Byron. Long after Byron's day, but long years before his dream was
realized, Mrs. Browning, in her _Casa Guidi Windows_ (1851), in the same
metre, re-echoed the same aspiration (see her _Preface_), "that the
future of Italy shall not be disinherited." (See for some of these
instances of _terza rima_, _Englische Metrik_, von Dr. J. Schipper,
1888, ii. 896. See, too, _The Metre of Dante's Comedy discussed and
exemplified_, by Alfred Forman and Harry Buxton Forman, 1878, p. 7.)

The MS. of the _Prophecy of Dante_, together with the Preface, was
forwarded to Murray, March 14, 1820; but in spite of some impatience on
the part of the author (Letter to Murray, May 8, 1820, _Letters_, 1901,
v. 20), and, after the lapse of some months, a pretty broad hint
(Letter, August 17, 1820, _ibid_., p. 165) that "the time for the Dante
would be good now ... as Italy is on the eve of great things,"
publication was deferred till the following year. _Marino Faliero, Doge
of Venice_, and the _Prophecy of Dante_ were published in the same
volume, April 21, 1821.

The _Prophecy of Dante_ was briefly but favourably noticed by Jeffrey in
his review of _Marino Faliero_ (_Edinb. Rev._, July, 1821, vol. 35, p.
285). "It is a very grand, fervid, turbulent, and somewhat mystical
composition, full of the highest sentiment and the highest poetry; ...
but disfigured by many faults of precipitation, and overclouded with
many obscurities. Its great fault with common readers will be that it
is not sufficiently intelligible.... It is, however, beyond all
question, a work of a man of great genius."

Other notices of _Marino Faliero_ and the _Prophecy of Dante_ appeared
in _Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine_, April, 1821, vol. 9, pp. 93-103; in
the _Monthly Review_, May, 1821, Enlarged Series, vol. 95, pp. 41-50;
and in the _Eclectic Review_, June 21, New Series, vol. xv. pp.
518-527.

    Lady! if for the cold and cloudy clime
      Where I was born, but where I would not die,
      Of the great Poet-Sire of Italy
    I dare to build[276] the imitative rhyme,
    Harsh Runic[277] copy of the South's sublime,
      Thou art the cause; and howsoever I
      Fall short of his immortal harmony,
    Thy gentle heart will pardon me the crime.
    Thou, in the pride of Beauty and of Youth,
       Spakest; and for thee to speak and be obeyed
    Are one; but only in the sunny South
      Such sounds are uttered, and such charms displayed,
    So sweet a language from so fair a mouth--[278]
      Ah! to what effort would it not persuade?

                                                 Ravenna, June 21, 1819.





                                 PREFACE

In the course of a visit to the city of Ravenna in the summer of 1819,
it was suggested to the author that having composed something on the
subject of Tasso's confinement, he should do the same on Dante's
exile,--the tomb of the poet forming one of the principal objects[279]
of interest in that city, both to the native and to the stranger.

"On this hint I spake," and the result has been the following four
cantos, in _terza rima_, now offered to the reader. If they are
understood and approved, it is my purpose to continue the poem in
various other cantos to its natural conclusion in the present age. The
reader is requested to suppose that Dante addresses him in the interval
between the conclusion of the _Divina Commedia_ and his death, and
shortly before the latter event, foretelling the fortunes of Italy in
general in the ensuing centuries. In adopting this plan I have had in my
mind the Cassandra of Lycophron,[280] and the Prophecy of Nereus by
Horace, as well as the Prophecies of Holy Writ. The measure adopted is
the _terza rima_ of Dante, which I am not aware to have seen hitherto
_tried in our language, except it may be by Mr. Hayley_,[281] of whose
translation I never saw but one extract, quoted in the notes to _Caliph
Vathek_; so that--if I do not err--this poem may be considered as a
metrical experiment. The cantos are short, and about the same length of
those of the poet, whose name I have borrowed and most likely taken in
vain.

Amongst the inconveniences of authors in the present day, it is
difficult for any who have a name, good or bad, to escape translation. I
have had the fortune to see the fourth canto of _Childe Harold_[282]
translated into Italian _versi sciolti_,--that is, a poem written in the
_Spenserean stanza_ into _blank verse_, without regard to the natural
divisions of the stanza or the sense. If the present poem, being on a
national topic, should chance to undergo the same fate, I would request
the Italian reader to remember that when I have failed in the imitation
of his great "Padre Alighier,"[283] I have failed in imitating that
which all study and few understand, since to this very day it is not yet
settled what was the meaning of the allegory[284] in the first canto of
the _Inferno_, unless Count Marchetti's ingenious and probable
conjecture may be considered as having decided the question.

He may also pardon my failure the more, as I am not quite sure that he
would be pleased with my success, since the Italians, with a pardonable
nationality, are particularly jealous of all that is left them as a
nation--their literature; and in the present bitterness of the classic
and romantic war, are but ill disposed to permit a foreigner even to
approve or imitate them, without finding some fault with his
ultramontane presumption. I can easily enter into all this, knowing what
would be thought in England of an Italian imitator of Milton, or if a
translation of Monti, Pindemonte, or Arici,[285] should be held up to
the rising generation as a model for their future poetical essays. But I
perceive that I am deviating into an address to the Italian reader,
where my business is with the English one; and be they few or many, I
must take my leave of both.




                          THE PROPHECY OF DANTE.


                             CANTO THE FIRST.

    Once more in Man's frail world! which I had left
      So long that 'twas forgotten; and I feel
      The weight of clay again,--too soon bereft
    Of the Immortal Vision which could heal
      My earthly sorrows, and to God's own skies
      Lift me from that deep Gulf without repeal,
    Where late my ears rung with the damned cries
      Of Souls in hopeless bale; and from that place
      Of lesser torment, whence men may arise
    Pure from the fire to join the Angelic race;                        10
      Midst whom my own bright Beatricē[286] blessed
      My spirit with her light; and to the base
    Of the Eternal Triad! first, last, best,[287]
      Mysterious, three, sole, infinite, great God!
      Soul universal! led the mortal guest,
    Unblasted by the Glory, though he trod
      From star to star to reach the almighty throne.[bw]
      Oh Beatrice! whose sweet limbs the sod
    So long hath pressed, and the cold marble stone,
      Thou sole pure Seraph of my earliest love,                        20
      Love so ineffable, and so alone,
    That nought on earth could more my bosom move,
      And meeting thee in Heaven was but to meet
      That without which my Soul, like the arkless dove,
    Had wandered still in search of, nor her feet
      Relieved her wing till found; without thy light
      My Paradise had still been incomplete.[288]
    Since my tenth sun gave summer to my sight
      Thou wert my Life, the Essence of my thought,
      Loved ere I knew the name of Love,[289] and bright                30
    Still in these dim old eyes, now overwrought
      With the World's war, and years, and banishment,
      And tears for thee, by other woes untaught;
    For mine is not a nature to be bent
      By tyrannous faction, and the brawling crowd,
      And though the long, long conflict hath been spent
    In vain,--and never more, save when the cloud
      Which overhangs the Apennine my mind's eye
      Pierces to fancy Florence, once so proud
    Of me, can I return, though but to die,                             40
      Unto my native soil,--they have not yet
      Quenched the old exile's spirit, stern and high.
    But the Sun, though not overcast, must set
      And the night cometh; I am old in days,
      And deeds, and contemplation, and have met
    Destruction face to face in all his ways.
      The World hath left me, what it found me, pure,
      And if I have not gathered yet its praise,
    I sought it not by any baser lure;
      Man wrongs, and Time avenges, and my name                         50
      May form a monument not all obscure,
    Though such was not my Ambition's end or aim,
      To add to the vain-glorious list of those
      Who dabble in the pettiness of fame,
    And make men's fickle breath the wind that blows
      Their sail, and deem it glory to be classed
      With conquerors, and Virtue's other foes,
    In bloody chronicles of ages past.
      I would have had my Florence great and free;[290]
      Oh Florence! Florence![291] unto me thou wast                     60
    Like that Jerusalem which the Almighty He
      Wept over, "but thou wouldst not;" as the bird
      Gathers its young, I would have gathered thee
    Beneath a parent pinion, hadst thou heard
      My voice; but as the adder, deaf and fierce,
      Against the breast that cherished thee was stirred
    Thy venom, and my state thou didst amerce,
      And doom this body forfeit to the fire.[292]
      Alas! how bitter is his country's curse
    To him who _for_ that country would expire,                         70
      But did not merit to expire _by_ her,
      And loves her, loves her even in her ire.
    The day may come when she will cease to err,
      The day may come she would be proud to have
      The dust she dooms to scatter, and transfer[bx]
    Of him, whom she denied a home, the grave.
      But this shall not be granted; let my dust
      Lie where it falls; nor shall the soil which gave
    Me breath, but in her sudden fury thrust
      Me forth to breathe elsewhere, so reassume                        80
      My indignant bones, because her angry gust
    Forsooth is over, and repealed her doom;
      No,--she denied me what was mine--my roof,
      And shall not have what is not hers--my tomb.
    Too long her arméd wrath hath kept aloof
      The breast which would have bled for her, the heart
      That beat, the mind that was temptation proof,
    The man who fought, toiled, travelled, and each part
      Of a true citizen fulfilled, and saw
      For his reward the Guelf's ascendant art                          90
    Pass his destruction even into a law.
      These things are not made for forgetfulness,
      Florence shall be forgotten first; too raw
    The wound, too deep the wrong, and the distress
      Of such endurance too prolonged to make
      My pardon greater, her injustice less,
    Though late repented; yet--yet for her sake
      I feel some fonder yearnings, and for thine,
      My own Beatricē, I would hardly take
    Vengeance upon the land which once was mine,                       100
      And still is hallowed by thy dust's return,
      Which would protect the murderess like a shrine,
    And save ten thousand foes by thy sole urn.
      Though, like old Marius from Minturnæ's marsh
      And Carthage ruins, my lone breast may burn
    At times with evil feelings hot and harsh,[293]
      And sometimes the last pangs of a vile foe
      Writhe in a dream before me, and o'erarch
    My brow with hopes of triumph,--let them go!
      Such are the last infirmities of those                           110
      Who long have suffered more than mortal woe,
    And yet being mortal still, have no repose
      But on the pillow of Revenge--Revenge,
      Who sleeps to dream of blood, and waking glows
    With the oft-baffled, slakeless thirst of change,
      When we shall mount again, and they that trod
      Be trampled on, while Death and Até range
    O'er humbled heads and severed necks----Great God!
      Take these thoughts from me--to thy hands I yield
      My many wrongs, and thine Almighty rod                           120
    Will fall on those who smote me,--be my Shield!
      As thou hast been in peril, and in pain,
      In turbulent cities, and the tented field--
    In toil, and many troubles borne in vain
      For Florence,--I appeal from her to Thee!
      Thee, whom I late saw in thy loftiest reign,
    Even in that glorious Vision, which to see
      And live was never granted until now,
      And yet thou hast permitted this to me.
    Alas! with what a weight upon my brow                              130
      The sense of earth and earthly things come back,
      Corrosive passions, feelings dull and low,
    The heart's quick throb upon the mental rack,
      Long day, and dreary night; the retrospect
      Of half a century bloody and black,
    And the frail few years I may yet expect
      Hoary and hopeless, but less hard to bear,
      For I have been too long and deeply wrecked
    On the lone rock of desolate Despair,
      To lift my eyes more to the passing sail                         140
      Which shuns that reef so horrible and bare;
    Nor raise my voice--for who would heed my wail?
      I am not of this people, nor this age,
      And yet my harpings will unfold a tale
    Which shall preserve these times when not a page
      Of their perturbéd annals could attract
      An eye to gaze upon their civil rage,[by]
    Did not my verse embalm full many an act
      Worthless as they who wrought it: 'tis the doom
      Of spirits of my order to be racked                              150
    In life, to wear their hearts out, and consume
      Their days in endless strife, and die alone;
      Then future thousands crowd around their tomb,
    And pilgrims come from climes where they have known
      The name of him--who now is but a name,
      And wasting homage o'er the sullen stone,
    Spread his--by him unheard, unheeded--fame;
      And mine at least hath cost me dear: to die
      Is nothing; but to wither thus--to tame
    My mind down from its own infinity--                               160
      To live in narrow ways with little men,
      A common sight to every common eye,
    A wanderer, while even wolves can find a den,
      Ripped from all kindred, from all home, all things
      That make communion sweet, and soften pain--
    To feel me in the solitude of kings
      Without the power that makes them bear a crown--
      To envy every dove his nest and wings
    Which waft him where the Apennine looks down
      On Arno, till he perches, it may be,                             170
      Within my all inexorable town,
    Where yet my boys are, and that fatal She,[294]
      Their mother, the cold partner who hath brought
      Destruction for a dowry--this to see
    And feel, and know without repair, hath taught
      A bitter lesson; but it leaves me free:
      I have not vilely found, nor basely sought,
    They made an Exile--not a Slave of me.


                            CANTO THE SECOND.

    The Spirit of the fervent days of Old,
      When words were things that came to pass, and Thought
      Flashed o'er the future, bidding men behold
    Their children's children's doom already brought
      Forth from the abyss of Time which is to be,
      The Chaos of events, where lie half-wrought
    Shapes that must undergo mortality;
      What the great Seers of Israel wore within,
      That Spirit was on them, and is on me,
    And if, Cassandra-like, amidst the din                              10
      Of conflict none will hear, or hearing heed
      This voice from out the Wilderness, the sin
    Be theirs, and my own feelings be my meed,
      The only guerdon I have ever known.
      Hast thou not bled? and hast thou still to bleed,
    Italia? Ah! to me such things, foreshown
      With dim sepulchral light, bid me forget
      In thine irreparable wrongs my own;
    We can have but one Country, and even yet
      Thou'rt mine--my bones shall be within thy breast,                20
      My Soul within thy language, which once set
    With our old Roman sway in the wide West;
      But I will make another tongue arise
      As lofty and more sweet, in which expressed
    The hero's ardour, or the lover's sighs,
      Shall find alike such sounds for every theme
      That every word, as brilliant as thy skies,
    Shall realise a Poet's proudest dream,
      And make thee Europe's Nightingale of Song;[295]
      So that all present speech to thine shall seem                    30
    The note of meaner birds, and every tongue
      Confess its barbarism when compared with thine.[bz]
      This shalt thou owe to him thou didst so wrong,
    Thy Tuscan bard, the banished Ghibelline.
      Woe! woe! the veil of coming centuries
      Is rent,--a thousand years which yet supine
    Lie like the ocean waves ere winds arise,
      Heaving in dark and sullen undulation,
      Float from Eternity into these eyes;
    The storms yet sleep, the clouds still keep their station,          40
      The unborn Earthquake yet is in the womb,
      The bloody Chaos yet expects Creation,
    But all things are disposing for thy doom;
      The Elements await but for the Word,
      "Let there be darkness!" and thou grow'st a tomb!
    Yes! thou, so beautiful, shalt feel the sword,[296]
      Thou, Italy! so fair that Paradise,
      Revived in thee, blooms forth to man restored:
    Ah! must the sons of Adam lose it twice?
      Thou, Italy! whose ever golden fields,                            50
      Ploughed by the sunbeams solely, would suffice
    For the world's granary; thou, whose sky Heaven gilds[ca]
      With brighter stars, and robes with deeper blue;
      Thou, in whose pleasant places Summer builds
    Her palace, in whose cradle Empire grew,
      And formed the Eternal City's ornaments
      From spoils of Kings whom freemen overthrew;
    Birthplace of heroes, sanctuary of Saints,
      Where earthly first, then heavenly glory made[cb]
      Her home; thou, all which fondest Fancy paints,                   60
    And finds her prior vision but portrayed
      In feeble colours, when the eye--from the Alp
      Of horrid snow, and rock, and shaggy shade
    Of desert-loving pine, whose emerald scalp
      Nods to the storm--dilates and dotes o'er thee,
      And wistfully implores, as 'twere, for help
    To see thy sunny fields, my Italy,
      Nearer and nearer yet, and dearer still
      The more approached, and dearest were they free,
    Thou--Thou must wither to each tyrant's will:                       70
      The Goth hath been,--the German, Frank, and Hun[297]
      Are yet to come,--and on the imperial hill
    Ruin, already proud of the deeds done
      By the old barbarians, there awaits the new,
      Throned on the Palatine, while lost and won
    Rome at her feet lies bleeding; and the hue
      Of human sacrifice and Roman slaughter
      Troubles the clotted air, of late so blue,
    And deepens into red the saffron water
      Of Tiber, thick with dead; the helpless priest,                   80
      And still more helpless nor less holy daughter,
    Vowed to their God, have shrieking fled, and ceased
      Their ministry: the nations take their prey,
      Iberian, Almain, Lombard, and the beast
    And bird, wolf, vulture, more humane than they
      Are; these but gorge the flesh, and lap the gore
      Of the departed, and then go their way;
    But those, the human savages, explore
      All paths of torture, and insatiate yet,
      With Ugolino hunger prowl for more.                               90
    Nine moons shall rise o'er scenes like this and set;[298]
      The chiefless army of the dead, which late
      Beneath the traitor Prince's banner met,
    Hath left its leader's ashes at the gate;
      Had but the royal Rebel lived, perchance
      Thou hadst been spared, but his involved thy fate.
    Oh! Rome, the Spoiler or the spoil of France,
      From Brennus to the Bourbon, never, never
      Shall foreign standard to thy walls advance,
    But Tiber shall become a mournful river.                           100
      Oh! when the strangers pass the Alps and Po,
      Crush them, ye Rocks! Floods whelm them, and for ever!
    Why sleep the idle Avalanches so,
      To topple on the lonely pilgrim's head?
      Why doth Eridanus but overflow
    The peasant's harvest from his turbid bed?
      Were not each barbarous horde a nobler prey?
      Over Cambyses' host[299] the desert spread
    Her sandy ocean, and the Sea-waves' sway
      Rolled over Pharaoh and his thousands,--why,[cc]                 110
      Mountains and waters, do ye not as they?
    And you, ye Men! Romans, who dare not die,
      Sons of the conquerors who overthrew
      Those who overthrew proud Xerxes, where yet lie
    The dead whose tomb Oblivion never knew,
      Are the Alps weaker than Thermopylæ?
      Their passes more alluring to the view
    Of an invader? is it they, or ye,
      That to each host the mountain-gate unbar,
      And leave the march in peace, the passage free?                  120
    Why, Nature's self detains the Victor's car,
      And makes your land impregnable, if earth
      Could be so; but alone she will not war,
    Yet aids the warrior worthy of his birth
      In a soil where the mothers bring forth men:
      Not so with those whose souls are little worth;
    For them no fortress can avail,--the den
      Of the poor reptile which preserves its sting
      Is more secure than walls of adamant, when
    The hearts of those within are quivering.                          130
      Are ye not brave? Yes, yet the Ausonian soil
      Hath hearts, and hands, and arms, and hosts to bring
    Against Oppression; but how vain the toil,
      While still Division sows the seeds of woe
      And weakness, till the Stranger reaps the spoil.[300]
    Oh! my own beauteous land! so long laid low,
      So long the grave of thy own children's hopes,
      When there is but required a single blow
    To break the chain, yet--yet the Avenger stops,
      And Doubt and Discord step 'twixt thine and thee,                140
      And join their strength to that which with thee copes;
    What is there wanting then to set thee free,
      And show thy beauty in its fullest light?
      To make the Alps impassable; and we,
    Her Sons, may do this with one deed--Unite.


                            CANTO THE THIRD.

    From out the mass of never-dying ill,[cd]
      The Plague, the Prince, the Stranger, and the Sword,
      Vials of wrath but emptied to refill
    And flow again, I cannot all record
      That crowds on my prophetic eye: the Earth
      And Ocean written o'er would not afford
    Space for the annal, yet it shall go forth;
      Yes, all, though not by human pen, is graven,
      There where the farthest suns and stars have birth,
    Spread like a banner at the gate of Heaven,                         10
      The bloody scroll of our millennial wrongs
      Waves, and the echo of our groans is driven
    Athwart the sound of archangelic songs,
      And Italy, the martyred nation's gore,
      Will not in vain arise to where belongs[ce]
    Omnipotence and Mercy evermore:
      Like to a harpstring stricken by the wind,
      The sound of her lament shall, rising o'er
    The Seraph voices, touch the Almighty Mind.
      Meantime I, humblest of thy sons, and of                          20
      Earth's dust by immortality refined
    To Sense and Suffering, though the vain may scoff,
      And tyrants threat, and meeker victims bow
      Before the storm because its breath is rough,
    To thee, my Country! whom before, as now,
      I loved and love, devote the mournful lyre
      And melancholy gift high Powers allow
    To read the future: and if now my fire
      Is not as once it shone o'er thee, forgive!
      I but foretell thy fortunes--then expire;                         30
    Think not that I would look on them and live.
      A Spirit forces me to see and speak,
      And for my guerdon grants _not_ to survive;
    My Heart shall be poured over thee and break:
      Yet for a moment, ere I must resume
      Thy sable web of Sorrow, let me take
    Over the gleams that flash athwart thy gloom
      A softer glimpse; some stars shine through thy night,
      And many meteors, and above thy tomb
    Leans sculptured Beauty, which Death cannot blight:                 40
      And from thine ashes boundless Spirits rise
      To give thee honour, and the earth delight;
    Thy soil shall still be pregnant with the wise,
      The gay, the learned, the generous, and the brave,
      Native to thee as Summer to thy skies,
    Conquerors on foreign shores, and the far wave,[301]
      Discoverers of new worlds, which take their name;[302]
      For _thee_ alone they have no arm to save,
    And all thy recompense is in their fame,
      A noble one to them, but not to thee--                            50
      Shall they be glorious, and thou still the same?
    Oh! more than these illustrious far shall be
      The Being--and even yet he may be born--
      The mortal Saviour who shall set thee free,
    And see thy diadem, so changed and worn
      By fresh barbarians, on thy brow replaced;
      And the sweet Sun replenishing thy morn,
    Thy moral morn, too long with clouds defaced,
      And noxious vapours from Avernus risen,
      Such as all they must breathe who are debased                     60
    By Servitude, and have the mind in prison.[303]
      Yet through this centuried eclipse of woe[cf]
      Some voices shall be heard, and Earth shall listen;
    Poets shall follow in the path I show,
      And make it broader: the same brilliant sky
      Which cheers the birds to song shall bid them glow,[cg]
    And raise their notes as natural and high;
      Tuneful shall be their numbers; they shall sing
      Many of Love, and some of Liberty,
    But few shall soar upon that Eagle's wing,                          70
      And look in the Sun's face, with Eagle's gaze,
      All free and fearless as the feathered King,
    But fly more near the earth; how many a phrase
      Sublime shall lavished be on some small prince
      In all the prodigality of Praise!
    And language, eloquently false, evince[ch]
      The harlotry of Genius, which, like Beauty,[ci]
      Too oft forgets its own self-reverence,
    And looks on prostitution as a duty.[304]
      He who once enters in a Tyrant's hall[cj][305]                    80
      As guest is slave--his thoughts become a booty,
    And the first day which sees the chain enthral
      A captive, sees his half of Manhood gone[306]--
      The Soul's emasculation saddens all
    His spirit; thus the Bard too near the throne
      Quails from his inspiration, bound to _please_,--
      How servile is the task to please alone!
    To smooth the verse to suit his Sovereign's ease
      And royal leisure, nor too much prolong
      Aught save his eulogy, and find, and seize,                       90
    Or force, or forge fit argument of Song!
      Thus trammelled, thus condemned to Flattery's trebles,
      He toils through all, still trembling to be wrong:
    For fear some noble thoughts, like heavenly rebels,
      Should rise up in high treason to his brain,
      He sings, as the Athenian spoke, with pebbles
    In's mouth, lest Truth should stammer through his strain.
      But out of the long file of sonneteers
      There shall be some who will not sing in vain,
    And he, their Prince, shall rank among my peers,[307]
      And Love shall be his torment; but his grief
      Shall make an immortality of tears,
    And Italy shall hail him as the Chief
      Of Poet-lovers, and his higher song
      Of Freedom wreathe him with as green a leaf.
    But in a farther age shall rise along
      The banks of Po two greater still than he;
      The World which smiled on him shall do them wrong
    Till they are ashes, and repose with me.
      The first will make an epoch with his lyre,                      110
      And fill the earth with feats of Chivalry:[308]
    His Fancy like a rainbow, and his Fire,
      Like that of Heaven, immortal, and his Thought
      Borne onward with a wing that cannot tire;
    Pleasure shall, like a butterfly new caught,
      Flutter her lovely pinions o'er his theme,
      And Art itself seem into Nature wrought
    By the transparency of his bright dream.--
      The second, of a tenderer, sadder mood,
      Shall pour his soul out o'er Jerusalem;                          120
    He, too, shall sing of Arms, and Christian blood
      Shed where Christ bled for man; and his high harp
      Shall, by the willow over Jordan's flood,
    Revive a song of Sion, and the sharp
      Conflict, and final triumph of the brave
      And pious, and the strife of Hell to warp
    Their hearts from their great purpose, until wave
      The red-cross banners where the first red Cross
      Was crimsoned from His veins who died to save,[ck]
    Shall be his sacred argument; the loss                             130
      Of years, of favour, freedom, even of fame
      Contested for a time, while the smooth gloss
    Of Courts would slide o'er his forgotten name
      And call Captivity a kindness--meant
      To shield him from insanity or shame--
    Such shall be his meek guerdon! who was sent
      To be Christ's Laureate--they reward him well!
      Florence dooms me but death or banishment,
    Ferrara him a pittance and a cell,[309]
      Harder to bear and less deserved, for I                          140
      Had stung the factions which I strove to quell;
    But this meek man who with a lover's eye
      Will look on Earth and Heaven, and who will deign
      To embalm with his celestial flattery,
    As poor a thing as e'er was spawned to reign,[310]
      What will _he_ do to merit such a doom?
      Perhaps he'll _love_,--and is not Love in vain
    Torture enough without a living tomb?
      Yet it will be so--he and his compeer,
      The Bard of Chivalry, will both consume[311]                     150
    In penury and pain too many a year,
      And, dying in despondency, bequeath
      To the kind World, which scarce will yield a tear,
    A heritage enriching all who breathe
      With the wealth of a genuine Poet's soul,
      And to their country a redoubled wreath,
    Unmatched by time; not Hellas can unroll
      Through her Olympiads two such names, though one[312]
      Of hers be mighty;--and is this the whole
    Of such men's destiny beneath the Sun?[313]                        160
      Must all the finer thoughts, the thrilling sense,
      The electric blood with which their arteries run,[cl]
    Their body's self turned soul with the intense
      Feeling of that which is, and fancy of
      That which should be, to such a recompense
    Conduct? shall their bright plumage on the rough
      Storm be still scattered? Yes, and it must be;
      For, formed of far too penetrable stuff,
    These birds of Paradise[314] but long to flee
      Back to their native mansion, soon they find                     170
      Earth's mist with their pure pinions not agree,
    And die or are degraded; for the mind
      Succumbs to long infection, and despair,
      And vulture Passions flying close behind,
    Await the moment to assail and tear;[315]
      And when, at length, the wingéd wanderers stoop,
      Then is the Prey-birds' triumph, then they share
    The spoil, o'erpowered at length by one fell swoop.
      Yet some have been untouched who learned to bear,
      Some whom no Power could ever force to droop,                    180
    Who could resist themselves even, hardest care!
      And task most hopeless; but some such have been,
      And if my name amongst the number were,
    That Destiny austere, and yet serene,
      Were prouder than more dazzling fame unblessed;
      The Alp's snow summit nearer heaven is seen
    Than the Volcano's fierce eruptive crest,
      Whose splendour from the black abyss is flung,
      While the scorched mountain, from whose burning breast
    A temporary torturing flame is wrung,                              190
      Shines for a night of terror, then repels
      Its fire back to the Hell from whence it sprung,
    The Hell which in its entrails ever dwells.


                           CANTO THE FOURTH.

    Many are Poets who have never penned
      Their inspiration, and perchance the best:
      They felt, and loved, and died, but would not lend
    Their thoughts to meaner beings; they compressed
      The God within them, and rejoined the stars
      Unlaurelled upon earth, but far more blessed
    Than those who are degraded by the jars
      Of Passion, and their frailties linked to fame,
      Conquerors of high renown, but full of scars.
    Many are Poets but without the name;                                10
      For what is Poesy but to create
      From overfeeling Good or Ill; and aim[316]
    At an external life beyond our fate,
      And be the new Prometheus of new men,[317]
      Bestowing fire from Heaven, and then, too late,
    Finding the pleasure given repaid with pain,
      And vultures to the heart of the bestower,
      Who, having lavished his high gift in vain,
    Lies to his lone rock by the sea-shore?
      So be it: we can bear.--But thus all they                         20
      Whose Intellect is an o'ermastering Power
    Which still recoils from its encumbering clay
      Or lightens it to spirit, whatsoe'er
      The form which their creations may essay,
    Are bards; the kindled Marble's bust may wear
      More poesy upon its speaking brow
      Than aught less than the Homeric page may bear;
    One noble stroke with a whole life may glow,
      Or deify the canvass till it shine
      With beauty so surpassing all below,                              30
    That they who kneel to Idols so divine
      Break no commandment, for high Heaven is there
      Transfused, transfigurated:[318] and the line
    Of Poesy, which peoples but the air
      With Thought and Beings of our thought reflected,
      Can do no more: then let the artist share
    The palm, he shares the peril, and dejected
      Faints o'er the labour unapproved--Alas!
      Despair and Genius are too oft connected.
    Within the ages which before me pass                                40
      Art shall resume and equal even the sway
      Which with Apelles and old Phidias
    She held in Hellas' unforgotten day.
      Ye shall be taught by Ruin to revive
      The Grecian forms at least from their decay,
    And Roman souls at last again shall live
      In Roman works wrought by Italian hands,
      And temples, loftier than the old temples, give
    New wonders to the World; and while still stands
      The austere Pantheon, into heaven shall soar                      50
      A Dome,[319] its image, while the base expands
    Into a fane surpassing all before,
      Such as all flesh shall flock to kneel in: ne'er
      Such sight hath been unfolded by a door
    As this, to which all nations shall repair,
      And lay their sins at this huge gate of Heaven.
      And the bold Architect[320] unto whose care
    The daring charge to raise it shall be given,
      Whom all Arts shall acknowledge as their Lord,
      Whether into the marble chaos driven                              60
    His chisel bid the Hebrew,[321] at whose word
      Israel left Egypt, stop the waves in stone,[cm]
      Or hues of Hell be by his pencil poured
    Over the damned before the Judgement-throne,[322]
      Such as I saw them, such as all shall see,
      Or fanes be built of grandeur yet unknown--
    The Stream of his great thoughts shall spring from me[323]
      The Ghibelline, who traversed the three realms
      Which form the Empire of Eternity.
    Amidst the clash of swords, and clang of helms,                     70
      The age which I anticipate, no less
      Shall be the Age of Beauty, and while whelms
    Calamity the nations with distress,
      The Genius of my Country shall arise,
      A Cedar towering o'er the Wilderness,
    Lovely in all its branches to all eyes,
      Fragrant as fair, and recognised afar,
      Wafting its native incense through the skies.
    Sovereigns shall pause amidst their sport of war,
      Weaned for an hour from blood, to turn and gaze                   80
      On canvass or on stone; and they who mar
    All beauty upon earth, compelled to praise,
      Shall feel the power of that which they destroy;
      And Art's mistaken gratitude shall raise
    To tyrants, who but take her for a toy,
      Emblems and monuments, and prostitute
      Her charms to Pontiffs proud,[324] who but employ
    The man of Genius as the meanest brute
      To bear a burthen, and to serve a need,
      To sell his labours, and his soul to boot.                        90
    Who toils for nations may be poor indeed,
      But free; who sweats for Monarchs is no more
      Than the gilt Chamberlain, who, clothed and feed,
    Stands sleek and slavish, bowing at his door.
      Oh, Power that rulest and inspirest! how
      Is it that they on earth, whose earthly power[325]
    Is likest thine in heaven in outward show,
      Least like to thee in attributes divine,
      Tread on the universal necks that bow,
    And then assure us that their rights are thine?                    100
      And how is it that they, the Sons of Fame,
      Whose inspiration seems to them to shine
    From high, they whom the nations oftest name,
      Must pass their days in penury or pain,
      Or step to grandeur through the paths of shame,
    And wear a deeper brand and gaudier chain?
      Or if their Destiny be born aloof
      From lowliness, or tempted thence in vain,
    In their own souls sustain a harder proof,
      The inner war of Passions deep and fierce?                       110
      Florence! when thy harsh sentence razed my roof,
    I loved thee; but the vengeance of my verse,
      The hate of injuries which every year
      Makes greater, and accumulates my curse,
    Shall live, outliving all thou holdest dear--
      Thy pride, thy wealth, thy freedom, and even _that_,
      The most infernal of all evils here,
    The sway of petty tyrants in a state;
      For such sway is not limited to Kings,
      And Demagogues yield to them but in date,                        120
    As swept off sooner; in all deadly things,
      Which make men hate themselves, and one another,
      In discord, cowardice, cruelty, all that springs
    From Death the Sin-born's incest with his mother,[326]
      In rank oppression in its rudest shape,
      The faction Chief is but the Sultan's brother,
    And the worst Despot's far less human ape.
      Florence! when this lone spirit, which so long
      Yearned, as the captive toiling at escape,
    To fly back to thee in despite of wrong,                           130
      An exile, saddest of all prisoners,[327]
      Who has the whole world for a dungeon strong,
    Seas, mountains, and the horizon's[328] verge for bars,[cn]
      Which shut him from the sole small spot of earth
      Where--whatsoe'er his fate--he still were hers,
    His Country's, and might die where he had birth--
      Florence! when this lone Spirit shall return
      To kindred Spirits, thou wilt feel my worth,
    And seek to honour with an empty urn[329]
      The ashes thou shalt ne'er obtain--Alas!                         140
      "What have I done to thee, my People?"[330] Stern
    Are all thy dealings, but in this they pass
      The limits of Man's common malice, for
      All that a citizen could be I was--
    Raised by thy will, all thine in peace or war--
      And for this thou hast warred with me.--'Tis done:
      I may not overleap the eternal bar[331]
    Built up between us, and will die alone,
      Beholding with the dark eye of a Seer
      The evil days to gifted souls foreshown,                         150
    Foretelling them to those who will not hear;
      As in the old time, till the hour be come
      When Truth shall strike their eyes through many a tear,
    And make them own the Prophet in his tomb.

[280] [The _Cassandra_ or _Alexandra_ of Lycophron, one of the seven
"Pleiades" who adorned the court of Ptolemy Philadelphus (third century
B.C.), is "an iambic monologue of 1474 verses, in which Cassandra is
made to prophesy the fall of Troy ... with numerous other historical
events, ... ending with [the reign of] Alexandra the Great." Byron had
probably read a translation of the _Cassandra_ by Philip Yorke, Viscount
Royston (born 1784, wrecked in the _Agatha_ off Memel, April 7, 1808),
which was issued at Cambridge in 1806. The _Alexandra_ forms part of the

_Poetical Works_, 1898, i. 321, note 1) prints a translation of the
three first cantos of the _Inferno_, which, he says (p. 172), was
written "a few years ago to oblige a particular friend." "Of all
Hayley's compositions," writes Southey (_Quart. Rev._, vol. xxxi. pp.
283, 284), "these specimens are the best ... in thus following his
original Hayley was led into a sobriety and manliness of diction which
... approached ... to the manner of a better age."

[284] [The Panther, the Lion, and the She-wolf, which Dante encountered
on the "desert slope" (_Inferno_, Canto I. lines 31, _sq._), were no
doubt suggested by Jer. v. 6: "Idcirco percussit eos leo de silva, lupus
ad vesperam vastavit eos, pardus vigilans super civitates corum."
Symbolically they have been from the earliest times understood as
denoting--the panther, lust; the lion, pride; the wolf, avarice; the
sins affecting youth, maturity, and old age. Later commentators have
suggested that there may be an underlying political symbolism as well,
and that the three beasts may stand for Florence with her "Black" and
"White" parties, the power of France, and the Guelf party as typically
representative of these vices (_The Hell of Dante_, by A. J. Butler,
1892, p. 5, note).

mud.... They hauled him out naked and covered with dirt, and carried him
to Minturnæ." Afterwards, when he sailed for Carthage, he had no sooner
landed than he was ordered by the governor (Sextilius) to quit Africa.
On his once more gaining the ascendancy and re-entering Rome (B.C. 87),
he justified the massacre of Sulla's adherents in a blood-thirsty
oration. Past ignominy and present triumph seem to have turned his head
("ut erat inter iram toleratæ fortunæ, et lætitiam emendatæ, parum
compos animi").--Plut., "Marius," _apud_ Langhorne, 1838, p. 304; Livii

[by] {252}----_their civic rage_.--[MS. Alternative reading.]

[294] {253} This lady, whose name was _Gemma_, sprung from one of the
most powerful Guelph families, named Donati. Corso Donati was the
principal adversary of the Ghibellines. She is--described as being
"_Admodum morosa, ut de Xantippe Socratis philosophi conjuge scriptum
esse legimus,_" according to Giannozzo Manetti. But Lionardo Aretino is
scandalised with Boccace, in his life of Dante, for saying that literary
men should not marry. "Qui il Boccaccio non ha pazienza, e dice, le
mogli esser contrarie agli studj; e non si ricorda che Socrate, il più
nobile filosofo che mai fusse, ebbe moglie e figliuoli e ufici nella
Repubblica nella sua Città; e Aristotile che, etc., etc., ebbe due
moglie in varj tempi, ed ebbe figliuoli, e ricchezze assai.--E Marco
Tullio--e Catone--e Varrone--e Seneca--ebbero moglie," etc., etc. [_Le
Vite di Dante, etc._, Firenze, 1677, pp. 22, 23]. It is odd that honest
Lionardo's examples, with the exception of Seneca, and, for anything I
know, of Aristotle, are not the most felicitous. Tully's Terentia, and
Socrates' Xantippe, by no means contributed to their husbands'
happiness, whatever they might do to their philosophy--Cato gave away
his wife--of Varro's we know nothing--and of Seneca's, only that she was
disposed to die with him, but recovered and lived several years
afterwards. But says Leonardo, "L'uomo è _animale civile_, secondo piace
a tutti i filosofi." And thence concludes that the greatest proof of the
_animal's civism_ is "la prima congiunzione, dalla quale multiplicata
nasce la Città."

[There is nothing in the _Divina Commedia_, or elsewhere in his
writings, to justify the common belief that Dante was unhappily married,
unless silence may be taken to imply dislike and alienation. It has been
supposed that he alludes to his wife, Gemma Donati, in the _Vita Nuova_,
§ 36, "as a young and very beautiful lady, who was gazing upon me from a
window, with a gaze full of pity," "who remembered me many times of my
own most noble lady," whom he consented to serve "more because of her
gentle goodness than from any choice" of his own (_Convito_, ii. 2. 7),
but there are difficulties in the way of accepting this theory. There
is, however, not the slightest reason for believing that the words which
he put into the mouth of Jacopo Rusticucci, "La fiera moglie più
ch'altro, mi nuoce" ["and truly, my savage wife, more than aught else,
doth harm me"] (_Inferno_, xvi. 45), were winged with any personal
reminiscence or animosity. But with Byron (see his letter to Lady Byron,
dated April 3, 1820, in which he quotes these lines "with intention"
[_Letters_, 1901, v. 2]), as with Boccaccio, "the wish was father to the
thought," and both were glad to quote Dante as a victim to matrimony.

Seven children were born to Dante and Gemma. Of these "his son Pietro,
who wrote a commentary on the _Divina Commedia_, settled as judge in
Verona. His daughter Beatrice lived as a nun in Ravenna" (_Dante_, by
Oscar Browning, 1891, p. 47).]

[295] {256}[In his defence of the "mother-tongue" as a fitting vehicle
for a commentary on his poetry, Dante argues "that natural love moves
the lover principally to three things: the one is to exalt the loved
object, the second is to be jealous thereof, the third is to defend it
... and these three things made me adopt it, that is, our mother-tongue,
which naturally and accidentally I love and have loved." Again, having
laid down the premiss that "the magnanimous man always praises himself
in his heart; and so the pusillanimous man always deems himself less
than he is," he concludes, "Wherefore many on account of this vileness
of mind, depreciate their native tongue, and applaud that of others; and
all such as these are the abominable wicked men of Italy, who hold this
precious mother-tongue in vile contempt, which, if it be vile in any
case, is so only inasmuch as it sounds in the evil mouth of these
adulterers."--_Il Convito_, caps. x., xi., translated by Elizabeth Price
Sayer, 1887, pp. 34-40.]

The "traitor Prince" was Charles IV., Connétable de Bourbon, Comte de
Montpensier, born 1490, who was killed at the capture of Rome, May 6,
1527. "His death, far from restraining the ardour of the assailants [the
Imperial troops, consisting of Germans and Spanish foot], increased it;
and with the loss of about 1000 men, they entered and sacked the
city.... The disorders committed by the soldiers were dreadful, and the
booty they made incredible. They added insults to cruelty, and scoffs to
rapaciousness. Upon the news of Bourbon's death, His Holiness, imagining
that his troops, no longer animated by his implacable spirit, might
listen to an accommodation, demanded a parley; but ... neglected all
means for defence.... Cardinals and bishops were ignominiously exposed
upon asses with their legs and hands bound; and wealthy citizens ...
suspected of having secreted their effects ... were tortured ... to
oblige them to make discoveries, ... the booty ... is said to have
amounted to about two millions and a half of ducats."--_Mod. Univ.

up the cause of Italian independence, or definitely threw in his lot
with the Carbonari, but his intimacy with the Gambas, which dates from
his migration to Ravenna in 1819, must from the first have brought him
within the area of political upheaval and disturbance. A year after
(April 16, 1820) he writes to Murray, "I have, besides, another reason
for desiring you to be speedy, which is, that there is that brewing in
Italy which will speedily cut off all security of communication.... I
shall, if permitted by the natives, remain to see what will come of it,
... for I shall think it by far the most interesting spectacle and
moment in existence, to see the Italians send the Barbarians of all
nations back to their own dens. I have lived long enough among them to
feel more for them as a nation than for any other people in existence:
but they want Union [see line 145], and they want principle; and I doubt
their success."--_Letters_, 1901, v. 8, note 1.]

Purgatorio_; and the subject of the Brazen Serpent, in the Sistine
Chapel, must remind every reader of Canto XXV. dell' _Inferno_."--_Life
of Michael Angelo_ by R. Duppa, 1856, p. 120.]

[323] I have read somewhere (if I do not err, for I cannot recollect
where,) that Dante was so great a favourite of Michael Angelo's, that he
had designed the whole of the Divina Commedia: but that the volume
containing these studies was lost by sea.

[Michel Angelo's copy of Dante, says Duppa (_ibid_., and note 1), "was a
large folio, with Landino's commentary; and upon the broad margin of the
leaves he designed with a pen and ink, all the interesting subjects.
This book was possessed by Antonio Montanti, a sculptor and architect in
Florence, who, being appointed architect to St. Peter's, removed to
Rome, and shipped his ... effects at Leghorn for Cività Vecchia, among
which was this edition of Dante. In the voyage the vessel foundered at
sea, and it was unfortunately lost in the wreck."]

[324] {273} See the treatment of Michel Angelo by Julius II., and his
neglect by Leo X. [Julius II. encouraged his attendance at the Vatican,
but one morning he was stopped by the chamberlain in waiting, who said,
"I have an order not to let you enter." Michel Angelo, indignant at the
insult, left Rome that very evening. Though Julius despatched five
couriers to bring him back, it was some months before he returned. Even
a letter (July 8, 1506), in which the Pope promised his "dearly beloved
Michel Angelo" that he should not be touched nor offended, but be
"reinstated in the apostolic grace," met with no response. It was this
quarrel with Julius II. which prevented the completion of the sepulchral
monument. The "Moses" and the figures supposed to represent the Active
and the Contemplative Life, and three Caryatides (since removed)
represent the whole of the original design, "a parallelogram surmounted
with forty statues, and covered with reliefs and other ornaments."--See

needed; that neither others had done me wrong, nor myself undergone
penalty undeservedly,--the penalty, I say, of exile and of poverty. For
it pleased the citizens of the fairest and most renowned daughter of
Rome--Florence--to cast me out of her most sweet bosom, where I was born
and bred, and passed half of the life of man, and in which, with her
good leave, I still desire with all my heart to repose my weary spirit,
and finish the days allotted me; and so I have wandered in almost every
place to which our language extends, a stranger, almost a beggar,
exposing against my will the wounds given me by fortune, too often
unjustly imputed to the sufferer's fault. Truly I have been a vessel
without sail and without rudder, driven about upon different ports and
shores by the dry wind that springs out of dolorous poverty; and hence
have I appeared vile in the eyes of many, who, perhaps, by some better
report, had conceived of me a different impression, and in whose sight
not only has my person become thus debased, but an unworthy opinion
created of everything which I did, or which I had to do."--_Il Convito_,

Poets_, 1846, i. 22, 23.]

                          THE MORGANTE MAGGIORE

                                 OF PULCI.




                 INTRODUCTION TO THE _MORGANTE MAGGIORE_.

It is possible that Byron began his translation of the First Canto of
Pulci's _Morgante Maggiore_ (so called to distinguish the entire poem of
twenty-eight cantos from the lesser _Morgante_ [or, to coin a title,
"_Morganid_"] which was published separately) in the late autumn of
1819, before he had left Venice (see his letter to Bankes, February 19,
1820, _Letters_, 1900, iv. 403). It is certain that it was finished at
Ravenna during the first week of his "domestication" in the Palazzo
Guiccioli (Letters to Murray, February 7, February 21, 1820). He took a
deal of pains with his self-imposed task, "servilely translating stanza
from stanza, and line from line, two octaves every night;" and when the
first canto was finished he was naturally and reasonably proud of his
achievement. More than two years had elapsed since Frere's
_Whistlecraft_ had begotten _Beppo_, and in the interval he had written
four cantos of _Don Juan_, outstripping his "immediate model," and
equalling if not surpassing his model's parents and precursors, the
masters of "narrative romantic poetry among the Italians."

In attempting this translation--something, as he once said of his
Armenian studies, "craggy for his mind to break upon" (Letter to Moore,
December 5, 1816, _Letters_, 1900, iv. 10)--Byron believed that he was
working upon virgin soil. He had read, as he admits in his
"Advertisement," John Herman Merivale's poem, _Orlando in Roncesvalles_,
which is founded upon the _Morgante Maggiore_; but he does not seem to
have been aware that many years before (1806, 1807) the same writer (one
of the "associate bards") had published in the _Monthly Magazine_ (May,
July, 1806, etc., _vide ante_ Introduction to _Beppo_, p. 156) a series
of translations of selected passages of the poem. There is no
resemblance whatever between Byron's laboured and faithful rendering of
the text, and Merivale's far more readable paraphrase, and it is
evident that if these selections ever passed before his eyes, they had
left no impression on his memory. He was drawn to the task partly on
account of its difficulty, but chiefly because in Pulci he recognized a
kindred spirit who suggested and compelled a fresh and final dedication
of his genius to the humorous epopee. The translation was an act of
devotion, the offering of a disciple to a master.

"The apparent contradictions of the _Morgante Maggiore_ ... the brusque
transition from piety to ribaldry, from pathos to satire," the
paradoxical union of persiflage with gravity, a confession of faith
alternating with a profession of mockery and profanity, have puzzled and
confounded more than one student and interpreter. An intimate knowledge
of the history, the literature, the art, the manners and passions of the
times has enabled one of his latest critics and translators, John
Addington Symonds, to come as near as may be to explaining the
contradictions; but the essential quality of Pulci's humour eludes
analysis.

We know that the poem itself, as Pio Rajna has shown, "the _rifacimento_
of two earlier popular poems," was written to amuse Lucrezia Tornabuoni,
the mother of Lorenzo de' Medici, and that it was recited, canto by
canto, in the presence of such guests as Poliziano, Ficino, and
Michelangelo Buonarotti; but how "it struck these contemporaries," and
whether a subtler instinct permitted them to untwist the strands and to
appraise the component parts at their precise ethical and spiritual
value, are questions for the exercise of the critical imagination. That
which attracted Byron to Pulci's writings was, no doubt, the co-presence
of faith, a certain _simplicity_ of faith, with an audacious and even
outrageous handling of the objects of faith, combined with a facile and
wanton alternation of romantic passion with a cynical mockery of
whatsoever things are sober and venerable. _Don Juan_ and the _Vision of
Judgment_ owe their existence to the _Morgante Maggiore_.

The MS. of the translation of Canto I. was despatched to England,
February 28, 1820. It is evident (see Letters, March 29, April 23, May
18, 1820, _Letters_, 1900, iv. 425, 1901, v. 17, 21) that Murray looked
coldly on Byron's "masterpiece" from the first. It was certain that any
new work by the author of _Don Juan_ would be subjected to the severest
and most hostile scrutiny, and it was doubtful if a translation of part
of an obscure and difficult poem, vaguely supposed to be coarse and
irreligious, would meet with even a tolerable measure of success. At any
rate, in spite of many inquiries and much vaunting of its excellence
(see Letters, June 29, September 12, 1821, _Letters_, 1901, v. 314,
362), the MS. remained for more than two years in Murray's hands, and it
was not until other arrangements came into force that the translation of
the First Canto of the _Morgante Maggiore_ appeared in the fourth and
last number of _The Liberal_, which was issued (by John Hunt) July 30,
1823.

For critical estimates of Luigi Pulci and the _Morgante Maggiore_, see

The Morgante Maggiore, of the first canto of which this translation is
offered, divides with the Orlando Innamorato the honour of having formed
and suggested the style and story of Ariosto.[332] The great defects of
Boiardo were his treating too seriously the narratives of chivalry, and
his harsh style. Ariosto, in his continuation, by a judicious mixture of
the gaiety of Pulci, has avoided the one; and Berni, in his reformation
of Boiardo's poem, has corrected the other. Pulci may be considered as
the precursor and model of Berni altogether, as he has partly been to
Ariosto, however inferior to both his copyists. He is no less the
founder of a new style of poetry very lately sprung up in England. I
allude to that of the ingenious Whistlecraft. The serious poems on
Roncesvalles in the same language, and more particularly the excellent
one of Mr. Merivale, are to be traced to the same source.[333] It has
never yet been decided entirely whether Pulci's intention was or was not
to deride the religion which is one of his favourite topics. It appears
to me, that such an intention would have been no less hazardous to the
poet than to the priest, particularly in that age and country; and the
permission to publish the poem, and its reception among the classics of
Italy, prove that it neither was nor is so interpreted. That he
intended to ridicule the monastic life, and suffered his imagination to
play with the simple dulness of his converted giant, seems evident
enough; but surely it were as unjust to accuse him of irreligion on this
account, as to denounce Fielding for his Parson Adams, Barnabas,[334]
Thwackum, Supple, and the Ordinary in Jonathan Wild,--or Scott, for the
exquisite use of his Covenanters in the "Tales of my Landlord."

In the following translation I have used the liberty of the original
with the proper names, as Pulci uses Gan, Ganellon, or Ganellone; Carlo,
Carlomagno, or Carlornano; Rondel, or Rondello, etc., as it suits his
convenience; so has the translator. In other respects the version is
faithful to the best of the translator's ability in combining his
interpretation of the one language with the not very easy task of
reducing it to the same versification in the other. The reader, on
comparing it with the original, is requested to remember that the
antiquated language of Pulci, however pure, is not easy to the
generality of Italians themselves, from its great mixture of Tuscan
proverbs; and he may therefore be more indulgent to the present attempt.
How far the translator has succeeded, and whether or no he shall
continue the work, are questions which the public will decide. He was
induced to make the experiment partly by his love for, and partial
intercourse with, the Italian language, of which it is so easy to
acquire a slight knowledge, and with which it is so nearly impossible
for a foreigner to become accurately conversant. The Italian language is
like a capricious beauty, who accords her smiles to all, her favours to
few, and sometimes least to those who have courted her longest. The
translator wished also to present in an English dress a part at least of
a poem never yet rendered into a northern language; at the same time
that it has been the original of some of the most celebrated productions
on this side of the Alps, as well of those recent experiments in poetry
in England which have been already mentioned.

    In the beginning was the Word next God;
      God was the Word, the Word no less was He:
    This was in the beginning, to my mode
      Of thinking, and without Him nought could be:
    Therefore, just Lord! from out thy high abode,
      Benign and pious, bid an angel flee,
    One only, to be my companion, who
    Shall help my famous, worthy, old song through.

                        II.

    And thou, oh Virgin! daughter, mother, bride,
      Of the same Lord, who gave to you each key
    Of Heaven, and Hell, and every thing beside,
      The day thy Gabriel said "All hail!" to thee,
    Since to thy servants Pity's ne'er denied,
      With flowing rhymes, a pleasant style and free,
    Be to my verses then benignly kind,
    And to the end illuminate my mind.

                        III.

    'Twas in the season when sad Philomel[336]
      Weeps with her sister, who remembers and
    Deplores the ancient woes which both befel,
      And makes the nymphs enamoured, to the hand
    Of Phaëton, by Phoebus loved so well,
      His car (but tempered by his sire's command)
    Was given, and on the horizon's verge just now
    Appeared, so that Tithonus scratched his brow:

                        IV.

    When I prepared my bark first to obey,
      As it should still obey, the helm, my mind,
    And carry prose or rhyme, and this my lay
      Of Charles the Emperor, whom you will find
    By several pens already praised; but they
      Who to diffuse his glory were inclined,
    For all that I can see in prose or verse,
    Have understood Charles badly, and wrote worse.

                        V.

    Leonardo Aretino said already,[337]
      That if, like Pepin, Charles had had a writer
    Of genius quick, and diligently steady,
      No hero would in history look brighter;
    He in the cabinet being always ready,
      And in the field a most victorious fighter,
    Who for the church and Christian faith had wrought,
    Certes, far more than yet is said or thought.

                        VI.

    You still may see at Saint Liberatore,[338]
      The abbey, no great way from Manopell,
    Erected in the Abruzzi to his glory,
      Because of the great battle in which fell
    A pagan king, according to the story,
      And felon people whom Charles sent to Hell:
    And there are bones so many, and so many,
    Near them Giusaffa's[339] would seem few, if any.

                        VII.

    But the world, blind and ignorant, don't prize
      His virtues as I wish to see them: thou,
    Florence, by his great bounty don't arise,[340]
      And hast, and may have, if thou wilt allow,
    All proper customs and true courtesies:
      Whate'er thou hast acquired from then till now,
    With knightly courage, treasure, or the lance,
    Is sprung from out the noble blood of France.


                        VIII.

    Twelve Paladins had Charles in court, of whom
      The wisest and most famous was Orlando;
    Him traitor Gan[341] conducted to the tomb
      In Roncesvalles, as the villain planned too,
    While the horn rang so loud, and knelled the doom
      Of their sad rout, though he did all knight can do:
    And Dante in his comedy has given
    To him a happy seat with Charles in Heaven.[342]

                        IX.

    'Twas Christmas-day; in Paris all his court
      Charles held; the Chief, I say, Orlando was,
    The Dane; Astolfo there too did resort,
      Also Ansuigi, the gay time to pass
    In festival and in triumphal sport,
      The much-renowned St. Dennis being the cause;
    Angiolin of Bayonne, and Oliver,
    And gentle Belinghieri too came there:

                        X.

    Avolio, and Arino, and Othone
      Of Normandy, and Richard Paladin,
    Wise Hamo, and the ancient Salamone,
      Walter of Lion's Mount, and Baldovin,
    Who was the son of the sad Ganellone,
      Were there, exciting too much gladness in
    The son of Pepin:--when his knights came hither,
    He groaned with joy to see them altogether.

                        XI.

    But watchful Fortune, lurking, takes good heed
      Ever some bar 'gainst our intents to bring.
    While Charles reposed him thus, in word and deed,
      Orlando ruled court, Charles, and every thing;
    Curst Gan, with envy bursting, had such need
      To vent his spite, that thus with Charles the king
    One day he openly began to say,
    "Orlando must we always then obey?

                        XII.

    "A thousand times I've been about to say,
      Orlando too presumptuously goes on;
    Here are we, counts, kings, dukes, to own thy sway,
      Hamo, and Otho, Ogier, Solomon,
    Each have to honour thee and to obey;
      But he has too much credit near the throne,
    Which we won't suffer, but are quite decided
    By such a boy to be no longer guided.

                        XIII.

    "And even at Aspramont thou didst begin
      To let him know he was a gallant knight,
    And by the fount did much the day to win;
      But I know _who_ that day had won the fight
    If it had not for good Gherardo been;
      The victory was Almonte's else; his sight
    He kept upon the standard--and the laurels,
    In fact and fairness, are his earning, Charles!

                        XIV.

    "If thou rememberest being in Gascony,
      When there advanced the nations out of Spain
    The Christian cause had suffered shamefully,
      Had not his valour driven them back again.
    Best speak the truth when there's a reason why:
      Know then, oh Emperor! that all complain:
    As for myself, I shall repass the mounts
    O'er which I crossed with two and sixty counts.

                        XV.

    "'Tis fit thy grandeur should dispense relief,
      So that each here may have his proper part,
    For the whole court is more or less in grief:
      Perhaps thou deem'st this lad a Mars in heart?"
    Orlando one day heard this speech in brief,
      As by himself it chanced he sate apart:
    Displeased he was with Gan because he said it,
    But much more still that Charles should give him credit.

                        XVI.

    And with the sword he would have murdered Gan,
      But Oliver thrust in between the pair,
    And from his hand extracted Durlindan,
      And thus at length they separated were.
    Orlando angry too with Carloman,
      Wanted but little to have slain him there;
    Then forth alone from Paris went the Chief,
    And burst and maddened with disdain and grief.

                        XVII.

    From Ermellina, consort of the Dane,
      He took Cortana, and then took Rondell,
    And on towards Brara pricked him o'er the plain;
      And when she saw him coming, Aldabelle
    Stretched forth her arms to clasp her lord again:
      Orlando, in whose brain all was not well,
    As "Welcome, my Orlando, home," she said,
    Raised up his sword to smite her on the head.

                        XVIII.

    Like him a Fury counsels, his revenge
      On Gan in that rash act he seemed to take,
    Which Aldabella thought extremely strange;
      But soon Orlando found himself awake;
    And his spouse took his bridle on this change,
      And he dismounted from his horse, and spake
    Of every thing which passed without demur,
    And then reposed himself some days with her.

                        XIX.

    Then full of wrath departed from the place,
      As far as pagan countries roamed astray,
    And while he rode, yet still at every pace
      The traitor Gan remembered by the way;
    And wandering on in error a long space,
      An abbey which in a lone desert lay,
    'Midst glens obscure, and distant lands, he found,
    Which formed the Christian's and the Pagan's bound.

                        XX.

    The Abbot was called Clermont, and by blood
      Descended from Angrante: under cover
    Of a great mountain's brow the abbey stood,
      But certain savage giants looked him over;
    One Passamont was foremost of the brood,
      And Alabaster and Morgante hover
    Second and third, with certain slings, and throw
    In daily jeopardy the place below.

                        XXI.

    The monks could pass the convent gate no more,
      Nor leave their cells for water or for wood;
    Orlando knocked, but none would ope, before
      Unto the Prior it at length seemed good;
    Entered, he said that he was taught to adore
      Him who was born of Mary's holiest blood,
    And was baptized a Christian; and then showed
    How to the abbey he had found his road.

                        XXII.

    Said the Abbot, "You are welcome; what is mine
      We give you freely, since that you believe
    With us in Mary Mother's Son divine;
      And that you may not, Cavalier, conceive
    The cause of our delay to let you in
      To be rusticity, you shall receive
    The reason why our gate was barred to you:
    Thus those who in suspicion live must do.

                        XXIII.

    "When hither to inhabit first we came
      These mountains, albeit that they are obscure,
    As you perceive, yet without fear or blame
      They seemed to promise an asylum sure:
    From savage brutes alone, too fierce to tame,
      'Twas fit our quiet dwelling to secure;
    But now, if here we'd stay, we needs must guard
    Against domestic beasts with watch and ward.

                        XXIV.

    "These make us stand, in fact, upon the watch;
      For late there have appeared three giants rough,
    What nation or what kingdom bore the batch
      I know not, but they are all of savage stuff;
    When Force and Malice with some genius match,
      You know, they can do all--_we_ are not enough:
    And these so much our orisons derange,
    I know not what to do, till matters change.

                        XXV.

    "Our ancient fathers, living the desert in,
      For just and holy works were duly fed;
    Think not they lived on locusts sole, 'tis certain
      That manna was rained down from heaven instead;
    But here 'tis fit we keep on the alert in
      Our bounds, or taste the stones showered down for bread,
    From off yon mountain daily raining faster,
    And flung by Passamont and Alabaster.

                        XXVI.

    "The third, Morgante, 's savagest by far; he
      Plucks up pines, beeches, poplar-trees, and oaks,
    And flings them, our community to bury;
      And all that I can do but more provokes."
    While thus they parley in the cemetery,
      A stone from one of their gigantic strokes,
    Which nearly crushed Rondell, came tumbling over,
    So that he took a long leap under cover.

                        XXVII.

    "For God-sake, Cavalier, come in with speed;
      The manna's falling now," the Abbot cried.
    "This fellow does not wish my horse should feed,
      Dear Abbot," Roland unto him replied,
    "Of restiveness he'd cure him had he need;
      That stone seems with good will and aim applied."
    The holy father said, "I don't deceive;
    They'll one day fling the mountain, I believe."

                        XXVIII.

    Orlando bade them take care of Rondello,
      And also made a breakfast of his own;
    "Abbot," he said, "I want to find that fellow
      Who flung at my good horse yon corner-stone."
    Said the abbot, "Let not my advice seem shallow;
      As to a brother dear I speak alone;
    I would dissuade you, Baron, from this strife,
    As knowing sure that you will lose your life.

                        XXIX.

    "That Passamont has in his hand three darts--
      Such slings, clubs, ballast-stones, that yield you must:
    You know that giants have much stouter hearts
      Than us, with reason, in proportion just:
    If go you will, guard well against their arts,
      For these are very barbarous and robust."
    Orlando answered," This I'll see, be sure,
    And walk the wild on foot to be secure."

                        XXX.

    The Abbot signed the great cross on his front,
      "Then go you with God's benison and mine."
    Orlando, after he had scaled the mount,
      As the Abbot had directed, kept the line
    Right to the usual haunt of Passamont;
      Who, seeing him alone in this design,
    Surveyed him fore and aft with eyes observant,
    Then asked him, "If he wished to stay as servant?"

                        XXXI.

    And promised him an office of great ease.
      But, said Orlando, "Saracen insane!
    I come to kill you, if it shall so please
      God, not to serve as footboy in your train;
    You with his monks so oft have broke the peace--
      Vile dog! 'tis past his patience to sustain."
    The Giant ran to fetch his arms, quite furious,
    When he received an answer so injurious.

                        XXXII.

    And being returned to where Orlando stood,
      Who had not moved him from the spot, and swinging
    The cord, he hurled a stone with strength so rude,
      As showed a sample of his skill in slinging;
    It rolled on Count Orlando's helmet good
      And head, and set both head and helmet ringing,
    So that he swooned with pain as if he died,
    But more than dead, he seemed so stupified.

                        XXXIII.

    Then Passamont, who thought him slain outright,
      Said, "I will go, and while he lies along,
    Disarm me: why such craven did I fight?"
      But Christ his servants ne'er abandons long,
    Especially Orlando, such a knight,
      As to desert would almost be a wrong.
    While the giant goes to put off his defences,
    Orlando has recalled his force and senses:

                        XXXIV.

    And loud he shouted, "Giant, where dost go?
      Thou thought'st me doubtless for the bier outlaid;
    To the right about--without wings thou'rt too slow
      To fly my vengeance--currish renegade!
    'Twas but by treachery thou laid'st me low."
      The giant his astonishment betrayed,
    And turned about, and stopped his journey on,
    And then he stooped to pick up a great stone.

                        XXXV.

    Orlando had Cortana bare in hand;
      To split the head in twain was what he schemed:
    Cortana clave the skull like a true brand,
      And pagan Passamont died unredeemed;
    Yet harsh and haughty, as he lay he banned,
      And most devoutly Macon still blasphemed[343];
    But while his crude, rude blasphemies he heard,
    Orlando thanked the Father and the Word,--

                        XXXVI.

    Saying, "What grace to me thou'st this day given!
      And I to thee, O Lord! am ever bound;
    I know my life was saved by thee from Heaven,
      Since by the Giant I was fairly downed.
    All things by thee are measured just and even;
      Our power without thine aid would nought be found:
    I pray thee take heed of me, till I can
    At least return once more to Carloman."

                        XXXVII.

    And having said thus much, he went his way;
      And Alabaster he found out below,
    Doing the very best that in him lay
      To root from out a bank a rock or two.
    Orlando, when he reached him, loud 'gan say,
      "How think'st thou, glutton, such a stone to throw?"
    When Alabaster heard his deep voice ring,
    He suddenly betook him to his sling,

                        XXXVIII.

    And hurled a fragment of a size so large
      That if it had in fact fulfilled its mission,
    And Roland not availed him of his targe,
      There would have been no need of a physician[344].
    Orlando set himself in turn to charge,
      And in his bulky bosom made incision
    With all his sword. The lout fell; but o'erthrown, he
    However by no means forgot Macone.

                        XXXIX.

    Morgante had a palace in his mode,
      Composed of branches, logs of wood, and earth,
    And stretched himself at ease in this abode,
      And shut himself at night within his berth.
    Orlando knocked, and knocked again, to goad
      The giant from his sleep; and he came forth,
    The door to open, like a crazy thing,
    For a rough dream had shook him slumbering.

                        XL.

    He thought that a fierce serpent had attacked him,
      And Mahomet he called; but Mahomet
    Is nothing worth, and, not an instant backed him;
      But praying blessed Jesu, he was set
    At liberty from all the fears which racked him;
      And to the gate he came with great regret--
    "Who knocks here?" grumbling all the while, said he.
    "That," said Orlando, "you will quickly see:

                        XLI.

    "I come to preach to you, as to your brothers,--
      Sent by the miserable monks--repentance;
    For Providence divine, in you and others,
      Condemns the evil done, my new acquaintance!
    'Tis writ on high--your wrong must pay another's:
      From Heaven itself is issued out this sentence.
    Know then, that colder now than a pilaster
    I left your Passamont and Alabaster."

                        XLII.

    Morgante said, "Oh gentle Cavalier!
      Now by thy God say me no villany;
    The favour of your name I fain would hear,
      And if a Christian, speak for courtesy."
    Replied Orlando, "So much to your ear
      I by my faith disclose contentedly;
    Christ I adore, who is the genuine Lord,
    And, if you please, by you may be adored."

                        XLIII.

    The Saracen rejoined in humble tone,
      "I have had an extraordinary vision;
    A savage serpent fell on me alone,
      And Macon would not pity my condition;
    Hence to thy God, who for ye did atone
      Upon the cross, preferred I my petition;
    His timely succour set me safe and free,
    And I a Christian am disposed to be."

                        XLIV.

    Orlando answered, "Baron just and pious,
      If this good wish your heart can really move
    To the true God, who will not then deny us
      Eternal honour, you will go above,
    And, if you please, as friends we will ally us,
      And I will love you with a perfect love.
    Your idols are vain liars, full of fraud:
    The only true God is the Christian's God.

                        XLV.

    "The Lord descended to the virgin breast
      Of Mary Mother, sinless and divine;
    If you acknowledge the Redeemer blest,
      Without whom neither sun nor star can shine,
    Abjure bad Macon's false and felon test,
      Your renegado god, and worship mine,
    Baptize yourself with zeal, since you repent."
    To which Morgante answered, "I'm content."

                        XLVI.

    And then Orlando to embrace him flew,
      And made much of his convert, as he cried,
    "To the abbey I will gladly marshal you."
      To whom Morgante, "Let us go," replied:
    "I to the friars have for peace to sue."
      Which thing Orlando heard with inward pride,
    Saying, "My brother, so devout and good,
    Ask the Abbot pardon, as I wish you would:

                        XLVII.

    "Since God has granted your illumination,
      Accepting you in mercy for his own,
    Humility should be your first oblation."
      Morgante said, "For goodness' sake, make known,--
    Since that your God is to be mine--your station,
      And let your name in verity be shown;
    Then will I everything at your command do."
    On which the other said, he was Orlando.

                        XLVIII.

    "Then," quoth the Giant, "blessed be Jesu
      A thousand times with gratitude and praise!
    Oft, perfect Baron! have I heard of you
      Through all the different periods of my days:
    And, as I said, to be your vassal too
      I wish, for your great gallantry always."
    Thus reasoning, they continued much to say,
    And onwards to the abbey went their way.

                        XLIX.

    And by the way about the giants dead
      Orlando with Morgante reasoned: "Be,
    For their decease, I pray you, comforted,
      And, since it is God's pleasure, pardon me;
    A thousand wrongs unto the monks they bred;
      And our true Scripture soundeth openly,
    Good is rewarded, and chastised the ill,
    Which the Lord never faileth to fulfil:

                        L.

    "Because His love of justice unto all
      Is such, He wills His judgment should devour
    All who have sin, however great or small;
      But good He well remembers to restore.
    Nor without justice holy could we call
      Him, whom I now require you to adore.
    All men must make His will their wishes sway,
    And quickly and spontaneously obey.

                        LI.

    "And here our doctors are of one accord,
      Coming on this point to the same conclusion,--
    That in their thoughts, who praise in Heaven the Lord,
      If Pity e'er was guilty of intrusion
    For their unfortunate relations stored
      In Hell below, and damned in great confusion,
    Their happiness would be reduced to nought,--
    And thus unjust the Almighty's self be thought.

                        LII.

    "But they in Christ have firmest hope, and all
      Which seems to Him, to them too must appear
    Well done; nor could it otherwise befall;
      He never can in any purpose err.
    If sire or mother suffer endless thrall,
      They don't disturb themselves for him or her:
    What pleases God to them must joy inspire;--
    Such is the observance of the eternal choir."

                        LIII.

    "A word unto the wise," Morgante said,
      "Is wont to be enough, and you shall see
    How much I grieve about my brethren dead;
      And if the will of God seem good to me,
    Just, as you tell me, 'tis in Heaven obeyed--
      Ashes to ashes,--merry let us be!
    I will cut off the hands from both their trunks,
    And carry them unto the holy monks.

                        LIV.

    "So that all persons may be sure and certain
      That they are dead, and have no further fear
    To wander solitary this desert in,
      And that they may perceive my spirit clear
    By the Lord's grace, who hath withdrawn the curtain
      Of darkness, making His bright realm appear."
    He cut his brethren's hands off at these words,
    And left them to the savage beasts and birds.

                        LV.

    Then to the abbey they went on together,
      Where waited them the Abbot in great doubt.
    The monks, who knew not yet the fact, ran thither
      To their superior, all in breathless rout,
    Saying with tremor, "Please to tell us whether
      You wish to have this person in or out?"
    The Abbot, looking through upon the Giant,
    Too greatly feared, at first, to be compliant.

                        LVI.

    Orlando seeing him thus agitated,
      Said quickly, "Abbot, be thou of good cheer;
    He Christ believes, as Christian must be rated,
      And hath renounced his Macon false;" which here
    Morgante with the hands corroborated,
      A proof of both the giants' fate quite clear:
    Thence, with due thanks, the Abbot God adored,
    Saying, "Thou hast contented me, O Lord!"

                        LVII.

    He gazed; Morgante's height he calculated,
      And more than once contemplated his size;
    And then he said, "O Giant celebrated!
      Know, that no more my wonder will arise,
    How you could tear and fling the trees you late did,
      When I behold your form with my own eyes.
    You now a true and perfect friend will show
    Yourself to Christ, as once you were a foe.

                        LVIII.

    "And one of our apostles, Saul once named,
      Long persecuted sore the faith of Christ,
    Till, one day, by the Spirit being inflamed,
      'Why dost thou persecute me thus?' said Christ;
    And then from his offence he was reclaimed,
      And went for ever after preaching Christ,
    And of the faith became a trump, whose sounding
    O'er the whole earth is echoing and rebounding.

                        LIX.

    "So, my Morgante, you may do likewise:
      He who repents--thus writes the Evangelist--
    Occasions more rejoicing in the skies
      Than ninety-nine of the celestial list.
    You may be sure, should each desire arise
      With just zeal for the Lord, that you'll exist
    Among the happy saints for evermore;
    But you were lost and damned to Hell before!"

                        LX.

    And thus great honour to Morgante paid
      The Abbot: many days they did repose.
    One day, as with Orlando they both strayed,
      And sauntered here and there, where'er they chose,
    The Abbot showed a chamber, where arrayed
      Much armour was, and hung up certain bows;
    And one of these Morgante for a whim
    Girt on, though useless, he believed, to him.

                        LXI.

    There being a want of water in the place,
      Orlando, like a worthy brother, said,
    "Morgante, I could wish you in this case
      To go for water." "You shall be obeyed
    In all commands," was the reply, "straight ways."
      Upon his shoulder a great tub he laid,
    And went out on his way unto a fountain,
    Where he was wont to drink, below the mountain.

                        LXII.

    Arrived there, a prodigious noise he hears,
      Which suddenly along the forest spread;
    Whereat from out his quiver he prepares
      An arrow for his bow, and lifts his head;
    And lo! a monstrous herd of swine appears,
      And onward rushes with tempestuous tread,
    And to the fountain's brink precisely pours;
    So that the Giant's joined by all the boars.

                        LXIII.

    Morgante at a venture shot an arrow,
      Which pierced a pig precisely in the ear,
    And passed unto the other side quite through;
      So that the boar, defunct, lay tripped up near.
    Another, to revenge his fellow farrow,
      Against the Giant rushed in fierce career,
    And reached the passage with so swift a foot,
    Morgante was not now in time to shoot.

                        LXIV.

    Perceiving that the pig was on him close,
      He gave him such a punch upon the head[345],
    As floored him so that he no more arose,
      Smashing the very bone; and he fell dead
    Next to the other. Having seen such blows,
      The other pigs along the valley fled;
    Morgante on his neck the bucket took,
    Full from the spring, which neither swerved nor shook.

                        LXV.

    The tub was on one shoulder, and there were
      The hogs on t'other, and he brushed apace
    On to the abbey, though by no means near,
      Nor spilt one drop of water in his race.
    Orlando, seeing him so soon appear
      With the dead boars, and with that brimful vase,
    Marvelled to see his strength so very great;
    So did the Abbot, and set wide the gate.

                        LXVI.

    The monks, who saw the water fresh and good[346],
      Rejoiced, but much more to perceive the pork;
    All animals are glad at sight of food:
      They lay their breviaries to sleep, and work
    With greedy pleasure, and in such a mood,
      That the flesh needs no salt beneath their fork.
    Of rankness and of rot there is no fear,
    For all the fasts are now left in arrear.

                        LXVII.

    As though they wished to burst at once, they ate;
      And gorged so that, as if the bones had been
    In water, sorely grieved the dog and cat,
      Perceiving that they all were picked too clean.
    The Abbot, who to all did honour great,
      A few days after this convivial scene,
    Gave to Morgante a fine horse, well trained,
    Which he long time had for himself maintained.

                        LXVIII.

    The horse Morgante to a meadow led,
      To gallop, and to put him to the proof,
    Thinking that he a back of iron had,
      Or to skim eggs unbroke was light enough;
    But the horse, sinking with the pain, fell dead,
      And burst, while cold on earth lay head and hoof.
    Morgante said, "Get up, thou sulky cur!"
    And still continued pricking with the spur.

                        LXIX.

    But finally he thought fit to dismount,
      And said, "I am as light as any feather,
    And he has burst;--to this what say you, Count?"
      Orlando answered, "Like a ship's mast rather
    You seem to me, and with the truck for front:
      Let him go! Fortune wills that we together
    Should march, but you on foot Morgante still."
    To which the Giant answered," So I will.

                        LXX.

    "When there shall be occasion, you will see
      How I approve my courage in the fight."
    Orlando said, "I really think you'll be,
      If it should prove God's will, a goodly knight;
    Nor will you napping there discover me.
      But never mind your horse, though out of sight
    'Twere best to carry him into some wood,
    If but the means or way I understood."

                        LXXI.

    The Giant said, "Then carry him I will,
      Since that to carry me he was so slack--
    To render, as the gods do, good for ill;
      But lend a hand to place him on my back."
    Orlando answered, "If my counsel still
      May weigh, Morgante, do not undertake
    To lift or carry this dead courser, who,
    As you have done to him, will do to you.

                        LXXII.

    "Take care he don't revenge himself, though dead,
      As Nessus did of old beyond all cure.
    I don't know if the fact you've heard or read;
      But he will make you burst, you may be sure."
    "But help him on my back," Morgante said,
      "And you shall see what weight I can endure.
    In place, my gentle Roland, of this palfrey,
    With all the bells, I'd carry yonder belfry."

                        LXXIII.

    The Abbot said, "The steeple may do well,
      But for the bells, you've broken them, I wot."
    Morgante answered, "Let them pay in Hell
      The penalty who lie dead in yon grot;"
    And hoisting up the horse from where he fell,
      He said, "Now look if I the gout have got,
    Orlando, in the legs,--or if I have force;"--
    And then he made two gambols with the horse.

                        LXXIV.

    Morgante was like any mountain framed;
      So if he did this 'tis no prodigy;
    But secretly himself Orlando blamed,
      Because he was one of his family;
    And fearing that he might be hurt or maimed,
      Once more he bade him lay his burden by:
    "Put down, nor bear him further the desert in."
    Morgante said, "I'll carry him for certain."

                        LXXV.

    He did; and stowed him in some nook away,
      And to the abbey then returned with speed.
    Orlando said, "Why longer do we stay?
      Morgante, here is nought to do indeed."
    The Abbot by the hand he took one day,
      And said, with great respect, he had agreed
    To leave his reverence; but for this decision
    He wished to have his pardon and permission.

                        LXXVI.

    The honours they continued to receive
      Perhaps exceeded what his merits claimed:
    He said, "I mean, and quickly, to retrieve
      The lost days of time past, which may be blamed;
    Some days ago I should have asked your leave,
      Kind father, but I really was ashamed,
    And know not how to show my sentiment,
    So much I see you with our stay content.

                        LXXVII.

    "But in my heart I bear through every clime
      The Abbot, abbey, and this solitude--
    So much I love you in so short a time;
      For me, from Heaven reward you with all good
    The God so true, the eternal Lord sublime!
      Whose kingdom at the last hath open stood.
    Meantime we stand expectant of your blessing.
    And recommend us to your prayers with pressing."

                        LXXVIII.

    Now when the Abbot Count Orlando heard,
      His heart grew soft with inner tenderness,
    Such fervour in his bosom bred each word;
      And, "Cavalier," he said, "if I have less
    Courteous and kind to your great worth appeared,
      Than fits me for such gentle blood to express,
    I know I have done too little in this case;
    But blame our ignorance, and this poor place.

                        LXXIX.

    "We can indeed but honour you with masses,
      And sermons, thanksgivings, and pater-nosters,
    Hot suppers, dinners (fitting other places
      In verity much rather than the cloisters);
    But such a love for you my heart embraces,
      For thousand virtues which your bosom fosters,
    That wheresoe'er you go I too shall be,
    And, on the other part, you rest with me.

                        LXXX.

    "This may involve a seeming contradiction;
      But you I know are sage, and feel, and taste,
    And understand my speech with full conviction.
      For your just pious deeds may you be graced
    With the Lord's great reward and benediction,
      By whom you were directed to this waste:
    To His high mercy is our freedom due,
    For which we render thanks to Him and you.

                        LXXXI.

    "You saved at once our life and soul: such fear
      The Giants caused us, that the way was lost
    By which we could pursue a fit career
      In search of Jesus and the saintly Host;
    And your departure breeds such sorrow here,
      That comfortless we all are to our cost;
    But months and years you would not stay in sloth,
    Nor are you formed to wear our sober cloth,

                        LXXXII.

    "But to bear arms, and wield the lance; indeed,
      With these as much is done as with this cowl;
    In proof of which the Scripture you may read,
      This Giant up to Heaven may bear his soul
    By your compassion: now in peace proceed.
      Your state and name I seek not to unroll;
    But, if I'm asked, this answer shall be given,
    That here an angel was sent down from Heaven.

                        LXXXIII.

    "If you want armour or aught else, go in,
      Look o'er the wardrobe, and take what you choose,
    And cover with it o'er this Giant's skin."
      Orlando answered, "If there should lie loose
    Some armour, ere our journey we begin,
      Which might be turned to my companion's use,
    The gift would be acceptable to me."
    The Abbot said to him, "Come in and see."

                        LXXXIV.

    And in a certain closet, where the wall
      Was covered with old armour like a crust,
    The Abbot said to them, "I give you all."
      Morgante rummaged piecemeal from the dust
    The whole, which, save one cuirass[347], was too small,
      And that too had the mail inlaid with rust.
    They wondered how it fitted him exactly,
    Which ne'er had suited others so compactly.

                        LXXXV.

    'Twas an immeasurable Giant's, who
      By the great Milo of Agrante fell
    Before the abbey many years ago.
      The story on the wall was figured well;
    In the last moment of the abbey's foe,
      Who long had waged a war implacable:
    Precisely as the war occurred they drew him,
    And there was Milo as he overthrew him.

                        LXXXVI.

    Seeing this history, Count Orlando said
      In his own heart, "O God who in the sky
    Know'st all things! how was Milo hither led?
      Who caused the Giant in this place to die?"
    And certain letters, weeping, then he read,
      So that he could not keep his visage dry,--
    As I will tell in the ensuing story:
    From evil keep you the high King of Glory!

[Note to Stanza v. Lines 1, 2.--In an Edition of the _Morgante Maggiore_
issued at Florence by G. Pulci, in 1900, line 2 of stanza v. runs thus--

    "Com' egli ebbe un Ormanno e 'l suo Turpino."

The allusion to "Ormanno," who has been identified with a mythical
chronicler, "Urmano from Paris" (see Rajna's _Ricerche sui Reali di
Francia_, 1872, p. 51), and the appeal to the authority of Leonardo
Aretino, must not be taken _au pied de la lettre_. At the same time, the
opinion attributed to Leonardo is in accordance with contemporary
sentiment and phraseology. Compare "Horum res gestas si qui auctores
digni celebrassent, quam magnæ, quam admirabiles, quam veteribus illis
similes viderentur."--B. Accolti Aretini (_ob._ 1466) _Dialogus de
Præstantiâ Virorum sui Ævi_. P. Villani, _Liber de Florentiæ Famosis
Civibus_, 1847, p. 112. From information kindly supplied by Professor V.
Rossi, of the University of Pavia.]

plot, killed her babe, and served up his flesh in a dish for her
husband's dinner. The sisters fled, and when Tereus pursued them with an
axe they besought the gods to change them into birds. Thereupon Procne
became a swallow, and Philomela a nightingale. So Hyginus, _Fabulæ_,

thus: "_comegliebbe u armano el suo turpino_;" and, apparently, it was
not till 1518 (Milano, by Zarotti) that _Pipino_ was substituted for
_Turpino_. Leonardo Bruni, surnamed Aretino (1369-1444), in his _Istoria
Fiorentina_ (1861, pp. 43, 47), commemorates the imperial magnificence
of _Carlo Magno_, and speaks of his benefactions to the Church, but does
not--in that work, at any rate--mention his biographers. It is possible
that if Pulci or Bruni had read Eginhard, they thought that his
chronicle was derogatory to Charlemagne. (See Gibbon's _Decline and
Fall_, 1825, iii. 376, note 1, and Hallam's _Europe during the Middle

413-417). _Sbergo_ or _usbergo_, as Moore points out (_Life_, p. 438,
note 2), "is obviously the same as hauberk, habergeon, etc., all from
the German _halsberg_, or covering for the neck." An old dictionary
which Byron might have consulted, _Vocabolario Italiano-Latino_, Venice,
1794, gives _thorax_, _lorica_, as the Latin equivalent of "Usbergo =
armadura del busto, corazza." (See, too, for an authority quoted in the

                  INTRODUCTION TO _FRANCESCA OF RIMINI_.


The MS. of "a _literal_ translation, word for word (versed like the
original), of the episode of Francesca of Rimini" (Letter March 23,
1820, _Letters_, 1900, iv. 421), was sent to Murray from Ravenna, March
20, 1820 (_ibid_., p. 419), a week after Byron had forwarded the MS. of
the _Prophecy of Dante_. Presumably the translation had been made in the
interval by way of illustrating and justifying the unfamiliar metre of
the "Dante Imitation." In the letter which accompanied the translation
he writes, "Enclosed you will find, _line for line_, in _third rhyme_
(_terza rima_,) of which your British Blackguard reader as yet
understands nothing, Fanny of Rimini. You know that she was born here,
and married, and slain, from Cary, Boyd, and such people already. I have
done it into _cramp_ English, line for line, and rhyme for rhyme, to try
the possibility. You had best append it to the poems already sent by
last three posts."

In the matter of the "British Blackguard," that is, the general reader,
Byron spoke by the card. Hayley's excellent translation of the three
first cantos of the _Inferno_ (_vide ante_, "Introduction to the
_Prophecy of Dante_," p. 237), which must have been known to a previous
generation, was forgotten, and with earlier experiments in _terza rima_,
by Chaucer and the sixteenth and seventeenth century poets, neither
Byron nor the British public had any familiar or definite acquaintance.
But of late some interest had been awakened or revived in Dante and the
_Divina Commedia_.

Cary's translation--begun in 1796, but not published as a whole till
1814--had met with a sudden and remarkable success. "The work, which had
been published four years, but had remained in utter obscurity, was at
once eagerly sought after. About a thousand copies of the first edition,
that remained on hand, were immediately disposed of; in less than three
months a new edition was called for." Moreover, the _Quarterly_ and
_Edinburgh Reviews_ were loud in its praises (_Memoir of H. F. Cary_,
1847, ii. 28). Byron seems to have thought that a fragment of the
_Inferno_, "versed like the original," would challenge comparison with
Cary's rendering in blank verse, and would lend an additional interest
to the "Pulci Translations, and the Dante Imitation." _Dîs aliter
visum_, and Byron's translation of the episode of _Francesca of Rimini_,
remained unpublished till it appeared in the pages of _The Letters and
Journals of Lord Byron_, 1830, ii. 309-311. (For separate translations
of the episode, see _Stories of the Italian Poets_, by Leigh Hunt, 1846,
i. 393-395, and for a rendering in blank verse by Lord [John] Russell,
see _Literary Souvenir_, 1830, pp. 285-287.)

                        FROM THE INFERNO OF DANTE.


                             CANTO THE FIFTH.

    "The Land where I was born[349] sits by the Seas
      Upon that shore to which the Po descends,
      With all his followers, in search of peace.
    Love, which the gentle heart soon apprehends,
      Seized him for the fair person which was ta'en
      From me[350], and me even yet the mode offends.
    Love, who to none beloved to love again
      Remits, seized me with wish to please, so strong[351],
      That, as thou see'st, yet, yet it doth remain.
    Love to one death conducted us along,                               10
      But Caina[352] waits for him our life who ended:"
      These were the accents uttered by her tongue.--
    Since I first listened to these Souls offended,
      I bowed my visage, and so kept it till--
      'What think'st thou?' said the bard[353]; when I unbended,
    And recommenced: 'Alas! unto such ill
      How many sweet thoughts, what strong ecstacies,
      Led these their evil fortune to fulfill!'
    And then I turned unto their side my eyes,
      And said, 'Francesca, thy sad destinies                           20
      Have made me sorrow till the tears arise.
    But tell me, in the Season of sweet sighs,
      By what and how thy Love to Passion rose,
      So as his dim desires to recognize?'
    Then she to me: 'The greatest of all woes
      Is to remind us of our happy days[co][354]
      In misery, and that thy teacher knows.
    But if to learn our Passion's first root preys
      Upon thy spirit with such Sympathy,
      I will do even as he who weeps and says.[cp][355]                 30
    We read one day for pastime, seated nigh,
      Of Lancilot, how Love enchained him too.
      We were alone, quite unsuspiciously.
    But oft our eyes met, and our Cheeks in hue
      All o'er discoloured by that reading were;
      But one point only wholly us o'erthrew;[cq]
    When we read the long-sighed-for smile of her,[cr]
      To be thus kissed by such devoted lover,[cs]
      He, who from me can be divided ne'er,
    Kissed my mouth, trembling in the act all over:                     40
      Accurséd was the book and he who wrote![356]
      That day no further leaf we did uncover.'
    While thus one Spirit told us of their lot,
      The other wept, so that with Pity's thralls
      I swooned, as if by Death I had been smote,[357]
    And fell down even as a dead body falls."[358]

                              CANTO QUINTO.

    'Siede la terra dove nata fui
      Sulla marina, dove il Po discende
      Per aver pace co' seguaci sui.
    Amor, che al cor gentil ratto s'apprende,
      Prese costui della bella persona
      Che mi fu tolta, e il modo ancor m' offende.
    Amor, che a nullo amato amar perdona,
      Mi prese del costui piacer si forte,
      Che, come vedi, ancor non mi abbandona.
    Amor condusse noi ad una morte:                                     10
      Caino attende chi vita ci spense.'
      Queste parole da lor ci fur porte.
    Da che io intesi quelle anime offense
      Chinai 'l viso, e tanto il tenni basso,
      Finchè il Poeta mi disse: 'Che pense?'
    Quando risposi, cominciai: 'O lasso!
      Quanti dolci pensier, quanto disio
      Menò costoro al doloroso passo!'
    Poi mi rivolsi a loro, e parla' io,
      E cominciai: 'Francesca, i tuoi martiri                           20
      A lagrimar mi fanno tristo e pio.
    Ma dimmi: al tempo de' dolci sospiri
      A che e come concedette Amore,
      Che conoscesti i dubbiosi desiri?'
    Ed ella a me: 'Nessun maggior dolore
      Che ricordarsi del tempo felice
      Nella miseria; e ciò sa il tuo dottore.
    Ma se a conoscer la prima radice
      Del nostro amor tu hai cotanto affetto
      Farò come colui che piange e dice.                                30
    Noi leggevamo un giorno per diletto
      Di Lancelotto, come Amor lo strinse:
      Soli eravamo, e senza alcun sospetto.
    Per più fiate gli occhi ci sospinse
      Quella lettura, e scolorocci il viso:
      Ma solo un punto fu quel che ci vinse.
    Quando leggemmo il disiato riso
      Esser baciato da cotanto amante,
      Questi, che mai da me non fia diviso,
    La bocca mi baciò tutto tremante:                                   40
      Galeotto fu il libro, e chi lo scrisse--
      Quel giorno più non vi leggemmo avante
    Mentre che l'uno spirto questo disse,
      L'altro piangeva sì che di pietade

[348] {317}[Dante, in his _Inferno_ (Canto V. lines 97-142), places
Francesca and her lover Paolo among the lustful in the second circle of
Hell. Francesca, daughter of Guido Vecchio da Polenta, Lord of Ravenna,
married (circ. 1275) Gianciotto, second son of Malatesta da Verrucchio,
Lord of Rimini. According to Boccaccio (_Il Comento sopra la Commedia_,
1863, i. 476, _sq._), Gianciotto was "hideously deformed in countenance
and figure," and determined to woo and marry Francesca by proxy. He
accordingly "sent, as his representative, his younger brother Paolo, the
handsomest and most accomplished man in all Italy. Francesca saw Paolo
arrive, and imagined she beheld her future husband. That mistake was the
commencement of her passion." A day came when the lovers were surprised
together, and Gianciotto slew both his brother and his wife.]

                    INTRODUCTION TO _MARINO FALIERO_.


Byron had no sooner finished the first draft of _Manfred_ than he began
(February 25, 1817) to lay the foundation of another tragedy. Venice was
new to him, and, on visiting the Doge's Palace, the veiled space
intended for the portrait of Marin Falier, and the "Giants' Staircase,"
where, as he believed, "he was once crowned and afterwards decapitated,"
had laid hold of his imagination, while the legend of the _Congiura_,
"an old man jealous and conspiring against the state of which he was ...
Chief," promised a subject which the "devil himself" might have
dramatized _con amore_.

But other interests and ideas claimed his attention, and for more than
three years the project slept. At length he slips into the postscript of
a letter to Murray, dated, "Ravenna, April 9, 1820" (_Letters_, 1901, v.
7), an intimation that he had begun "a tragedy on the subject of Marino
Faliero, the Doge of Venice." The "Imitation of Dante, the Translation
of Pulci, the Danticles," etc., were worked off, and, in prospecting for
a new vein, a fresh lode of literary ore, he passed, by a natural
transition, from Italian literature to Italian history, from the
romantic and humorous _epopee_ of Pulci and Berni, to the pseudo-classic
drama of Alfieri and Monti.

Jealousy, as "Monk" Lewis had advised him (August, 1817), was an
"exhausted passion" in the drama, and to lay the scene in Venice was to
provoke comparison with Shakespeare and Otway; but the man himself, the
fiery Doge, passionate but not jealous, a noble turned democrat _pro hac
vice_, an old man "greatly" finding "quarrel in a straw," afforded a
theme historically time-honoured, and yet unappropriated by tragic art.

There was, too, a living interest in the story. For history was
repeating itself, and "politics were savage and uncertain." "Mischief
was afoot," and the tradition of a conspiracy which failed might find an
historic parallel in a conspiracy which would succeed. There was "that
brewing in Italy" which might, perhaps, inspire "a people to redress
itself," "and with a cry of, 'Up with the Republic!' 'Down with the
Nobility!' send the Barbarians of all nations back to their own dens!"
(_Letters_, 1901, v. 10, 12, 19.)

In taking the field as a dramatist, Byron sought to win distinction for
himself--in the first place by historical accuracy, and, secondly, by
artistic regularity--by a stricter attention to the dramatic "unities."
"History is closely followed," he tells Murray, in a letter dated July
17, 1820; and, again, in the Preface (_vide post_, pp. 332-337), which
is an expansion of the letter, he gives a list of the authorities which
he had consulted, and claims to have "transferred into our language an
historical fact worthy of commemoration." More than once in his letters
to Murray he reverts to this profession of accuracy, and encloses some
additional note, in which he points out and rectifies an occasional
deviation from the historical record. In this respect, at any rate, he
could contend on more than equal terms "with established writers," that
is, with Shakespeare and Otway, and could present to his countrymen an
exacter and, so, more lifelike picture of the Venetian Republic. It is
plain, too, that he was bitten with the love of study for its own sake,
with a premature passion for erudition, and that he sought and found
relief from physical and intellectual excitement in the intricacies of
research. If his history is at fault, it was not from any lack of
diligence on his part, but because the materials at his disposal or
within his cognizance were inaccurate and misleading. He makes no
mention of the huge collection of Venetian archives which had recently
been deposited in the Convent of the Frari, or of Doria's transcript of
Sanudo's Diaries, bequeathed in 1816 to the Library of St. Mark; but he
quotes as his authorities the _Vitæ Ducum Venetorum_, of Marin Sanudo
(1466-1535), the _Storia, etc._, of Andrea Navagero (1483-1529), and the
_Principj di Storia, etc._, of Vettor Sandi, which belongs to the latter
half of the eighteenth century. Byron's chroniclers were ancient, but
not ancient enough; and, though they "handed down the story" (see
Medwin, _Conversations_, p. 173), they depart in numerous particulars
from the facts recorded in contemporary documents. Unquestionably the
legend, as it appears in Sanudo's perplexing and uncritical narrative
(see, for the translation of an original version of the Italian,
_Appendix_, pp. 462-467), is more dramatic than the "low beginnings" of
the myth, which may be traced to the annalists of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries; but, like other legends, it is insusceptible of
proof. Byron's Doge is almost, if not quite, as unhistorical as his
Bonivard or his Mazeppa. (See _Nuovo Archivio Veneto_, 1893, vol. v. pt.
i. pp. 95-197; 1897, vol. xiii. pt. i. pp. 5-107; pt. ii. pp. 277-374;
_Les Archives de Venise_, par Armand Baschet, 1870; _Storia della
Repubblica di Venizia_, Giuseppe Cappelletti, 1849, iv. pp. 262-317.)

At the close of the Preface, by way of an afterthought, Byron announces
his determination to escape "the reproach of the English theatrical
compositions" "by preserving a nearer approach to unity," by
substituting the regularity of French and Italian models for the
barbarities of the Elizabethan dramatists and their successors. Goethe
(_Conversations_, 1874, p. 114) is said to have "laughed to think that
Byron, who, in practical life, could never adapt himself, and never even
asked about a law, finally subjected himself to the stupidest of
laws--that of the _three unities_." It was, perhaps, in part with this
object in view, to make his readers smile, to provoke their
astonishment, that he affected a severity foreign to his genius and at
variance with his record. It was an agreeable thought that he could so
easily pass from one extreme to another, from _Manfred_ to _Marino
Faliero_, and, at the same time, indulge "in a little sally of
gratuitous sauciness" (_Quarterly Review_, July, 1822, vol. xxvii, p.
480) at the expense of his own countrymen. But there were other
influences at work. He had been powerfully impressed by the energy and
directness of Alfieri's work, and he was eager to emulate the gravity
and simplicity, if not the terseness and conciseness, of his style and
language. The drama was a new world to conquer, and so far as "his own
literature" was concerned it appeared that success might be attainable
by "a severer approach to the rules" (Letter to Murray, February 16,
1821)--that by taking Alfieri as his model he might step into the first
rank of English dramatists.

Goethe thought that Byron failed "to understand the purpose" of the
"three unities," that he regarded the law as an end in itself, and did
not perceive that if a play was comprehensible the unities might be
neglected and disregarded. It is possible that his "blind obedience to
the law" may have been dictated by the fervour of a convert; but it is
equally possible that he looked beyond the law or its fulfilment to an
ulterior object, the discomfiture of the romantic school, with its
contempt for regularity, its passionate appeal from art to nature. If he
was minded to raise a "Grecian temple of the purest architecture"
(_Letters_, 1901, v. Appendix III. p. 559), it was not without some
thought and hope of shaming, by force of contrast, the "mosque," the
"grotesque edifice" of barbarian contemporaries and rivals. Byron was
"ever a fighter," and his claim to regularity, to a closer preservation
of the "unities," was of the nature of a challenge.

_Marino Faliero_ was dedicated to "Baron Goethe," but the letter which
should have contained the dedication was delayed in transit. Goethe
never saw the dedication till it was placed in his hands by John Murray
the Third, in 1831, but he read the play, and after Byron's death bore
testimony to its peculiar characteristics and essential worth. "Lord
Byron, notwithstanding his predominant personality, has sometimes had
the power of renouncing himself altogether, as may be seen in some of
his dramatic pieces, particularly in his _Marino Faliero_. In this piece
one quite forgets that Lord Byron, or even an Englishman, wrote it. We
live entirely in Venice, and entirely in the time in which the action
takes place. The personages speak quite from themselves and their own
condition, without having any of the subjective feelings, thoughts, and
opinions of the poet" (_Conversations_, 1874, p. 453).

Byron spent three months over the composition of _Marino Faliero_. The
tragedy was completed July 17 (_Letters_, 1901, v. 52), and the copying
(_vide post_, p. 461, note 2) a month later (August 16, 17, 1820). The
final draft of "all the acts corrected" was despatched to England some
days before October 6, 1820.

Early in January, 1821 (see Letters to Murray, January 11, 20, 1821,
_Letters_, 1901, v. 221-228), an announcement reached Byron that his
play was to be brought out at Drury Lane Theatre, by Elliston. Against
this he protested by every means in his power, and finally, on
Wednesday, April 25, four days after the publication of the first
edition (April 21, 1821), an injunction was obtained from Lord
Chancellor Eldon, prohibiting a performance announced for that evening.
Elliston pursued the Chancellor to the steps of his own house, and at
the last moment persuaded him to allow the play to be acted on that
night only. Legal proceeedings were taken, but, in the end, the
injunction was withdrawn, with the consent of Byron's solicitors, and
the play was represented again on April 30, and on five nights in the
following May. As Byron had foreseen, _Marino Faliero_ was coldly
received by the playgoing public, and proved a loss to the "speculating
buffoons," who had not realized that it was "unfit for their Fair or
their booth" (Letter to Murray, January 20, 1821, _Letters_, 1901, v.
228, and p. 226, note 2. See, too, _Memoirs of Robert W. Elliston_,
1845, pp. 268-271).

Byron was the first to perceive that the story of Marino Faliero was a
drama "ready to hand;" but he has had many followers, if not imitators
or rivals.

"_Marino Faliero_, tragédie en cinq actes," by Casimir Jean François
Delavigne, was played for the first time at the Theatre of Porte Saint
Martin, May 31, 1829.

Ludwig, Leipzig, 1874; Martin Grief, Vienna, 1879; Murad Effendi (Franz
von Werner), 1881, and others (_Englische Studien_, vol. xxvii. pp. 146,

                                 PREFACE.

The conspiracy of the Doge Marino Faliero is one of the most remarkable
events in the annals of the most singular government, city, and people
of modern history. It occurred in the year 1355. Every thing about
Venice is, or was, extraordinary--her aspect is like a dream, and her
history is like a romance. The story of this Doge is to be found in all
her Chronicles, and particularly detailed in the "Lives of the Doges,"
by Marin Sanuto, which is given in the Appendix. It is simply and
clearly related, and is perhaps more dramatic in itself than any scenes
which can be founded upon the subject.

Marino Faliero appears to have been a man of talents and of courage. I
find him commander-in-chief of the land forces at the siege of
Zara,[359] where he beat the King of Hungary and his army of eighty
thousand men, killing eight thousand men, and keeping the besieged at
the same time in check; an exploit to which I know none similar in
history, except that of Cæsar at Alesia,[360] and of Prince Eugene at
Belgrade. He was afterwards commander of the fleet in the same war. He
took Capo d'Istria. He was ambassador at Genoa and Rome,--at which last
he received the news of his election to the dukedom; his absence being a
proof that he sought it by no intrigue, since he was apprised of his
predecessor's death and his own succession at the same moment. But he
appears to have been of an ungovernable temper. A story is told by
Sanuto, of his having, many years before, when podesta and captain at
Treviso, boxed the ears of the bishop, who was somewhat tardy in
bringing the Host.[361] For this, honest Sanuto "saddles him with a
judgment," as Thwackum did Square;[362] but he does not tell us whether
he was punished or rebuked by the Senate for this outrage at the time of
its commission. He seems, indeed, to have been afterwards at peace with
the church, for we find him ambassador at Rome, and invested with the
fief of Val di Marino, in the march of Treviso, and with the title of
count, by Lorenzo, Count-bishop of Ceneda. For these facts my
authorities are Sanuto, Vettor Sandi,[363] Andrea Navagero,[364] and the
account of the siege of Zara, first published by the indefatigable Abate
Morelli, in his _Monumenti Veneziani di varia Letteratura_, printed in
1796,[365] all of which I have looked over in the original language. The
moderns, Darù, Sismondi, and Laugier, nearly agree with the ancient
chroniclers. Sismondi attributes the conspiracy to his _jealousy_; but I
find this nowhere asserted by the national historians. Vettor Sandi,
indeed, says that "Altri scrissero che....dalla gelosa suspizion di esso
Doge siasi fatto (Michel Steno) staccar con violenza," etc., etc.; but
this appears to have been by no means the general opinion, nor is it
alluded to by Sanuto, or by Navagero; and Sandi himself adds, a moment
after, that "per altre Veneziane memorie traspiri, che non il _solo_
desiderio di vendetta lo dispose alla congiura ma anche la innata
abituale ambizion sua, per cui aneleva a farsi principe independente."
The first motive appears to have been excited by the gross affront of
the words written by Michel Steno on the ducal chair, and by the light
and inadequate sentence of the Forty on the offender, who was one of
their "tre Capi."[366] The attentions of Steno himself appear to have
been directed towards one of her damsels, and not to the
"Dogaressa"[367] herself, against whose fame not the slightest
insinuation appears, while she is praised for her beauty, and remarked
for her youth. Neither do I find it asserted (unless the hint of Sandi
be an assertion) that the Doge was actuated by jealousy of his wife; but
rather by respect for her, and for his own honour, warranted by his past
services and present dignity.

I know not that the historical facts are alluded to in English, unless
by Dr. Moore in his View of Italy[368]. His account is false and
flippant, full of stale jests about old men and young wives, and
wondering at so great an effect from so slight a cause. How so acute
and severe an observer of mankind as the author of Zeluco could wonder
at this is inconceivable. He knew that a basin of water spilt on Mrs.
Masham's gown deprived the Duke of Marlborough of his command, and led
to the inglorious peace of Utrecht--that Louis XIV. was plunged into the
most desolating wars, because his minister was nettled at his finding
fault with a window, and wished to give him another occupation--that
Helen lost Troy--that Lucretia expelled the Tarquins from Rome--and that
Cava brought the Moors to Spain--that an insulted husband led the Gauls
to Clusium, and thence to Rome--that a single verse of Frederick
II.[369] of Prussia on the Abbé de Bernis, and a jest on Madame de
Pompadour, led to the battle of Rosbach--that the elopement of
Dearbhorgil[370] with Mac Murchad conducted the English to the slavery
of Ireland that a personal pique between Maria Antoinette and the Duke
of Orleans precipitated the first expulsion of the Bourbons--and, not to
multiply instances of the _teterrima causa,_ that Commodus, Domitian,
and Caligula fell victims not to their public tyranny, but to private
vengeance--and that an order to make Cromwell disembark from the ship in
which he would have sailed to America destroyed both King and
Commonwealth. After these instances, on the least reflection it is
indeed extraordinary in Dr. Moore to seem surprised that a man used to
command, who had served and swayed in the most important offices, should
fiercely resent, in a fierce age, an unpunished affront, the grossest
that can be offered to a man, be he prince or peasant. The age of
Faliero is little to the purpose, unless to favour it--

    "The young man's wrath is like [light] straw on fire,
    _But like red hot steel is the old man's ire._"

                        [Davie Gellatley's song in _Waverley_, chap. xiv.]

    "Young men soon give and soon forget affronts,
    Old age is slow at both."

Laugier's reflections are more philosophical:--"Tale fù il fine
ignominioso di un' uomo, che la sua nascità, la sua età, il suo
carattere dovevano tener lontano dalle passioni produttrici di grandi
delitti. I suoi _talenti_ per lungo tempo esercitati ne' maggiori
impieghi, la sua capacità sperimentata ne' governi e nelle ambasciate,
gli avevano acquistato la stima e la fiducia de' cittadini, ed avevano
uniti i suffragj per collocarlo alla testa della repubblica. Innalzato
ad un grado che terminava gloriosamente la sua vita, il risentimento di
un' ingiuria leggiera insinuò nel suo cuore tal veleno che bastò a
corrompere le antiche sue qualità, e a condurlo al termine dei
scellerati; serio esempio, che prova _non esservi età, in cui la
prudenza umana sia sicura, e che nell' uomo restano sempre passioni
capaci a disonorarlo, quando non invigili sopra se stesso_."[371]

Where did Dr. Moore find that Marino Faliero begged his life? I have
searched the chroniclers, and find nothing of the kind: it is true that
he avowed all. He was conducted to the place of torture, but there is no
mention made of any application for mercy on his part; and the very
circumstance of their having taken him to the rack seems to argue any
thing but his having shown a want of firmness, which would doubtless
have been also mentioned by those minute historians, who by no means
favour him: such, indeed, would be contrary to his character as a
soldier, to the age in which he lived, and _at_ which he died, as it is
to the truth of history. I know no justification, at any distance of
time, for calumniating an historical character: surely truth belongs to
the dead, and to the unfortunate: and they who have died upon a scaffold
have generally had faults enough of their own, without attributing to
them that which the very incurring of the perils which conducted them to
their violent death renders, of all others, the most improbable. The
black veil which is painted over the place of Marino Faliero amongst
the Doges, and the Giants' Staircase[372], where he was crowned, and
discrowned, and decapitated, struck forcibly upon my imagination; as did
his fiery character and strange story. I went, in 1819, in search of his
tomb more than once to the church San Giovanni e San Paolo; and, as I
was standing before the monument of another family, a priest came up to
me and said, "I can show you finer monuments than that." I told him that
I was in search of that of the Faliero family, and particularly of the
Doge Marino's. "Oh," said he, "I will show it you;" and, conducting me
to the outside, pointed out a sarcophagus in the wall with an illegible
inscription[373]. He said that it had been in a convent adjoining, but
was removed after the French came, and placed in its present situation;
that he had seen the tomb opened at its removal; there were still some
bones remaining, but no positive vestige of the decapitation. The
equestrian statue[374] of which I have made mention in the third act as
before that church is not, however, of a Faliero, but of some other now
obsolete warrior, although of a later date. There were two other Doges
of this family prior to Marino; Ordelafo, who fell in battle at Zara, in
1117 (where his descendant afterwards conquered the Huns), and Vital
Faliero, who reigned in 1082. The family, originally from Fano, was of
the most illustrious in blood and wealth in the city of once the most
wealthy and still the most ancient families in Europe. The length I have
gone into on this subject will show the interest I have taken in it.
Whether I have succeeded or not in the tragedy, I have at least
transferred into our language an historical fact worthy of
commemoration.

It is now four years that I have meditated this work; and before I had
sufficiently examined the records, I was rather disposed to have made it
turn on a jealousy in Faliero. But, perceiving no foundation for this in
historical truth, and aware that jealousy is an exhausted passion in the
drama, I have given it a more historical form. I was, besides, well
advised by the late Matthew Lewis[375] on that point, in talking with
him of my intention at Venice in 1817. "If you make him jealous," said
he, "recollect that you have to contend with established writers, to say
nothing of Shakespeare, and an exhausted subject:--stick to the old
fiery Doge's natural character, which will bear you out, if properly
drawn; and make your plot as regular as you can." Sir William
Drummond[376] gave me nearly the same counsel. How far I have followed
these instructions, or whether they have availed me, is not for me to
decide. I have had no view to the stage; in its present state it is,
perhaps, not a very exalted object of ambition; besides, I have been too
much behind the scenes to have thought it so at any time.[ct] And I
cannot conceive any man of irritable feeling[cu] putting himself at the
mercies of an audience. The sneering reader, and the loud critic, and
the tart review, are scattered and distant calamities; but the trampling
of an intelligent or of an ignorant audience on a production which, be
it good or bad, has been a mental labour to the writer, is a palpable
and immediate grievance, heightened by a man's doubt of their competency
to judge, and his certainty of his own imprudence in electing them his
judges. Were I capable of writing a play which could be deemed
stage-worthy, success would give me no pleasure, and failure great pain.
It is for this reason that, even during the time of being one of the
committee of one of the theatres, I never made the attempt, and never
will[377]. But I wish that others would, for surely there is dramatic
power somewhere, where Joanna Baillie, and Milman, and John Wilson
exist. The _City of the Plague_[1816] and the _Fall of Jerusalem_ [1820]
are full of the best "_matériel_" for tragedy that has been seen since
Horace Walpole, except passages of _Ethwald_[1802] and _De
Montfort_[1798]. It is the fashion to underrate Horace Walpole; firstly,
because he was a nobleman, and secondly, because he was a gentleman;
but, to say nothing of the composition of his incomparable letters, and
of the _Castle of Otranto_[1765], he is the "Ultimus Romanorum," the
author of the _Mysterious Mother_[1768], a tragedy of the highest order,
and not a puling love-play. He is the father of the first romance and of
the last tragedy in our language, and surely worthy of a higher place
than any living writer, be he who he may.[378]

In speaking of the drama of _Marino Faliero_, I forgot to mention that
the desire of preserving, though still too remote, a nearer approach to
unity than the irregularity, which is the reproach of the English
theatrical compositions, permits, has induced me to represent the
conspiracy as already formed, and the Doge acceding to it; whereas, in
fact, it was of his own preparation and that of Israel Bertuccio. The
other characters (except that of the Duchess), incidents, and almost the
time, which was wonderfully short for such a design in real life, are
strictly historical, except that all the consultations took place in the
palace. Had I followed this, the unity would have been better preserved;
but I wished to produce the Doge in the full assembly of the
conspirators, instead of monotonously placing him always in dialogue
with the same individuals. For the real facts, I refer to the
Appendix.[379]

                  (AN HISTORICAL TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS.)




                                  ACT I.


             SCENE I.--_An Antechamber in the Ducal Palace_.

                PIETRO _speaks, in entering, to_ BATTISTA.

    _Pie_. Is not the messenger returned?[cv]

    _Bat_.                                   Not yet;
    I have sent frequently, as you commanded,
    But still the Signory[380] is deep in council,
    And long debate on Steno's accusation.

    _Pie_. Too long--at least so thinks the Doge.

    _Bat_.                                       How bears he
    These moments of suspense?

    _Pie_.                    With struggling patience.[cw]
    Placed at the Ducal table, covered o'er
    With all the apparel of the state--petitions,
    Despatches, judgments, acts, reprieves, reports,--
    He sits as rapt in duty; but whene'er[cx]                           10
    He hears the jarring of a distant door,
    Or aught that intimates a coming step,[cy]
    Or murmur of a voice, his quick eye wanders,
    And he will start up from his chair, then pause,
    And seat himself again, and fix his gaze
    Upon some edict; but I have observed
    For the last hour he has not turned a leaf.

    _Bat_. 'Tis said he is much moved,--and doubtless 'twas
    Foul scorn in Steno to offend so grossly.

    _Pie_. Aye, if a poor man: Steno's a patrician,                     20
    Young, galliard, gay, and haughty.[cz]

    _Bat_.                                Then you think
    He will not be judged hardly?

    _Pie_.                       'Twere enough
    He be judged justly; but 'tis not for us
    To anticipate the sentence of the Forty.

    _Bat_. And here it comes.--What news, Vincenzo?

                                _Enter_ VINCENZO.

    _Vin_.                                           'Tis
    Decided; but as yet his doom's unknown:
    I saw the President in act to seal
    The parchment which will bear the Forty's judgment
    Unto the Doge, and hasten to inform him.
    [_Exeunt_.


                      SCENE II.--The Ducal Chamber.

     MARINO FALIERO, _Doge; and his Nephew_, BERTUCCIO FALIERO.[381]

    _Ber. F._ It cannot be but they will do you justice.

    _Doge_. Aye, such as the Avogadori[382] did,
    Who sent up my appeal unto the Forty
    To try him by his peers, his own tribunal.

    _Ber. F._ His peers will scarce protect him; such an act
    Would bring contempt on all authority.

    _Doge_. Know you not Venice? Know you not the Forty?
    But we shall see anon.

    _Ber. F._ (_addressing_ VINCENZO, _then entering_.)
                           How now--what tidings?

    _Vin_. I am charged to tell his Highness that the court
    Has passed its resolution, and that, soon                           10
    As the due forms of judgment are gone through,
    The sentence will be sent up to the Doge;
    In the mean time the Forty doth salute
    The Prince of the Republic, and entreat
    His acceptation of their duty.

    _Doge_.                       Yes--
    They are wond'rous dutiful, and ever humble.
    Sentence is passed, you say?

    _Vin_.                      It is, your Highness:
    The President was sealing it, when I
    Was called in, that no moment might be lost
    In forwarding the intimation due                                    20
    Not only to the Chief of the Republic,
    But the complainant, both in one united.

    _Ber. F._ Are you aware, from aught you have perceived,
    Of their decision?

    _Vin_.            No, my Lord; you know
    The secret custom of the courts in Venice.

    _Ber. F._ True; but there still is something given to guess,
    Which a shrewd gleaner and quick eye would catch at;
    A whisper, or a murmur, or an air
    More or less solemn spread o'er the tribunal.
    The Forty are but men--most worthy men,                             30
    And wise, and just, and cautious--this I grant--
    And secret as the grave to which they doom
    The guilty: but with all this, in their aspects--
    At least in some, the juniors of the number--
    A searching eye, an eye like yours, Vincenzo,
    Would read the sentence ere it was pronounced.

    _Vin_. My Lord, I came away upon the moment,
    And had no leisure to take note of that
    Which passed among the judges, even in seeming;
    My station near the accused too, Michel Steno,                      40
    Made me--

    _Doge_ (_abruptly_). And how looked _he_? deliver that.

    _Vin_. Calm, but not overcast, he stood resigned
    To the decree, whate'er it were;--but lo!
    It comes, for the perusal of his Highness.

                  _Enter the_ SECRETARY _of the Forty_.

    _Sec_. The high tribunal of the Forty sends
    Health and respect to the Doge Faliero,[da]
    Chief magistrate of Venice, and requests
    His Highness to peruse and to approve
    The sentence passed on Michel Steno, born
    Patrician, and arraigned upon the charge                            50
    Contained, together with its penalty,
    Within the rescript which I now present.

    _Doge_. Retire, and wait without.
    [_Exeunt_ SECRETARY _and_ VINCENZO.]
                                               Take thou this paper:
    The misty letters vanish from my eyes;
    I cannot fix them.

    _Ber. F._          Patience, my dear Uncle:
    Why do you tremble thus?--nay, doubt not, all
    Will be as could be wished.

    _Doge_.                    Say on.

    _Ber. F._ (_reading_).           "Decreed
    In council, without one dissenting voice,
    That Michel Steno, by his own confession,
    Guilty on the last night of Carnival                                60
    Of having graven on the ducal throne
    The following words--"[383]

    _Doge_.                Would'st thou repeat them?
    Would'st _thou_ repeat them--_thou_, a Faliero,
    Harp on the deep dishonour of our house,
    Dishonoured in its Chief--that Chief the Prince
    Of Venice, first of cities?--To the sentence.

    _Ber. F._ Forgive me, my good Lord; I will obey--
    (_Reads_) "That Michel Steno be detained a month
    In close arrest."[384]

    _Doge_.             Proceed.

    _Ber. F._                  My Lord, 'tis finished.

    _Doge_. How say you?--finished! Do I dream?--'tis false--           70
    Give me the paper--(_snatches the paper and reads_)--
                      "'Tis decreed in council
    That Michel Steno"--Nephew, thine arm!

    _Ber. F._                          Nay,
    Cheer up, be calm; this transport is uncalled for--
    Let me seek some assistance.

    _Doge_.                     Stop, sir--Stir not--
    'Tis past.

    _Ber. F._   I cannot but agree with you
    The sentence is too slight for the offence;
    It is not honourable in the Forty
    To affix so slight a penalty to that
    Which was a foul affront to you, and even
    To them, as being your subjects; but 'tis not                       80
    Yet without remedy: you can appeal
    To them once more, or to the Avogadori,
    Who, seeing that true justice is withheld,
    Will now take up the cause they once declined,
    And do you right upon the bold delinquent.
    Think you not thus, good Uncle? why do you stand
    So fixed? You heed me not:--I pray you, hear me!

    _Doge_ (_dashing down the ducal bonnet, and offering to
    trample upon it, exclaims, as he is withheld by his nephew_).
    Oh! that the Saracen were in St. Mark's!
    Thus would I do him homage.

    _Ber. F._                  For the sake
    Of Heaven and all its saints, my Lord--

    _Doge_.                                Away!                        90
    Oh, that the Genoese were in the port!
    Oh, that the Huns whom I o'erthrew at Zara[385]
    Were ranged around the palace!

    _Ber. F._                      'Tis not well
    In Venice' Duke to say so.

    _Doge_.                   Venice' Duke!
    Who now is Duke in Venice? let me see him,
    That he may do me right.

    _Ber. F._               If you forget
    Your office, and its dignity and duty.
    Remember that of man, and curb this passion.
    The Duke of Venice----

    _Doge_ (_interrupting him_). There is no such thing--
    It is a word--nay, worse--a worthless by-word:                     100
    The most despised, wronged, outraged, helpless wretch,
    Who begs his bread, if 'tis refused by one,
    May win it from another kinder heart;
    But he, who is denied his right by those
    Whose place it is to do no wrong, is poorer
    Than the rejected beggar--he's a slave--
    And that am I--and thou--and all our house,
    Even from this hour; the meanest artisan
    Will point the finger, and the haughty noble
    May spit upon us:--where is our redress?                           110

    _Ber. F._ The law, my Prince--

    _Doge_ (_interrupting him_). You see what it has done;
    I asked no remedy but from the law--[386]
    I sought no vengeance but redress by law--
    I called no judges but those named by law--
    As Sovereign, I appealed unto my subjects,
    The very subjects who had made me Sovereign,
    And gave me thus a double right to be so.
    The rights of place and choice, of birth and service,
    Honours and years, these scars, these hoary hairs,
    The travel--toil--the perils--the fatigues--                       120
    The blood and sweat of almost eighty years,
    Were weighed i' the balance, 'gainst the foulest stain,
    The grossest insult, most contemptuous crime
    Of a rank, rash patrician--and found wanting!
    And this is to be borne!

    _Ber. F._                I say not that:--
    In case your fresh appeal should be rejected,
    We will find other means to make all even.

    _Doge_. Appeal again! art thou my brother's son?
    A scion of the house of Faliero?
    The nephew of a Doge? and of that blood                            130
    Which hath already given three dukes to Venice?
    But thou say'st well--we must be humble now.

    _Ber. F._ My princely Uncle! you are too much moved;--
    I grant it was a gross offence, and grossly
    Left without fitting punishment: but still
    This fury doth exceed the provocation,
    Or any provocation: if we are wronged,
    We will ask justice; if it be denied,
    We'll take it; but may do all this in calmness--
    Deep Vengeance is the daughter of deep Silence.                    140
    I have yet scarce a third part of your years,
    I love our house, I honour you, its Chief,
    The guardian of my youth, and its instructor--
    But though I understand your grief, and enter
    In part of your disdain, it doth appal me
    To see your anger, like our Adrian waves,
    O'ersweep all bounds, and foam itself to air.

    _Doge_. I tell thee--_must_ I tell thee--what thy father
    Would have required no words to comprehend?
    Hast thou no feeling save the external sense                       150
    Of torture from the touch? hast thou no soul--
    No pride--no passion--no deep sense of honour?

    _Ber. F._ 'Tis the first time that honour has been doubted,
    And were the last, from any other sceptic.

    _Doge_. You know the full offence of this born villain,
    This creeping, coward, rank, acquitted felon,
    Who threw his sting into a poisonous libel,[db]
    And on the honour of--Oh God! my wife,
    The nearest, dearest part of all men's honour,
    Left a base slur to pass from mouth to mouth                       160
    Of loose mechanics, with all coarse foul comments,
    And villainous jests, and blasphemies obscene;
    While sneering nobles, in more polished guise,
    Whispered the tale, and smiled upon the lie
    Which made me look like them--a courteous wittol,
    Patient--aye--proud, it may be, of dishonour.

    _Ber. F._ But still it was a lie--you knew it false,
    And so did all men.

    _Doge_.             Nephew, the high Roman
    Said, "Cæsar's wife must not even be suspected,"[387]
    And put her from him.

    _Ber. F._             True--but in those days----                  170

    _Doge_. What is it that a Roman would not suffer,
    That a Venetian Prince must bear? old Dandolo[dc]
    Refused the diadem of all the Cæsars,[388]
    And wore the ducal cap _I_ trample on--
    Because 'tis now degraded.

    _Ber. F._                  'Tis even so.

    _Doge_. It is--it is;--I did not visit on
    The innocent creature thus most vilely slandered
    Because she took an old man for her lord,
    For that he had been long her father's friend
    And patron of her house, as if there were                          180
    No love in woman's heart but lust of youth
    And beardless faces;--I did not for this
    Visit the villain's infamy on her,
    But craved my country's justice on his head,
    The justice due unto the humblest being
    Who hath a wife whose faith is sweet to him,
    Who hath a home whose hearth is dear to him--
    Who hath a name whose honour's all to him,
    When these are tainted by the accursing breath
    Of Calumny and Scorn.

    _Ber. F._             And what redress                             190
    Did you expect as his fit punishment?

    _Doge_. Death! Was I not the Sovereign of the state--
    Insulted on his very throne, and made
    A mockery to the men who should obey me?
    Was I not injured as a husband? scorned
    As man? reviled, degraded, as a Prince?
    Was not offence like his a complication
    Of insult and of treason?--and he lives!
    Had he instead of on the Doge's throne
    Stamped the same brand upon a peasant's stool,                     200
    His blood had gilt the threshold; for the carle
    Had stabbed him on the instant.

    _Ber. F._                      Do not doubt it,
    He shall not live till sunset--leave to me
    The means, and calm yourself.

    _Doge_.                       Hold, nephew: this
    Would have sufficed but yesterday; at present
    I have no further wrath against this man.

    _Ber. F._ What mean you? is not the offence redoubled
    By this most rank--I will not say--acquittal;
    For it is worse, being full acknowledgment
    Of the offence, and leaving it unpunished?                         210

    _Doge_. It is _redoubled_, but not now by him:
    The Forty hath decreed a month's arrest--
    We must obey the Forty.

    _Ber. F._               Obey _them_!
    Who have forgot their duty to the Sovereign?

    _Doge_. Why, yes;--boy, you perceive it then at last;
    Whether as fellow citizen who sues
    For justice, or as Sovereign who commands it,
    They have defrauded me of both my rights
    (For here the Sovereign is a citizen);
    But, notwithstanding, harm not thou a hair                         220
    Of Steno's head--he shall not wear it long.

    _Ber. F._ Not twelve hours longer, had you left to me
    The mode and means; if you had calmly heard me,
    I never meant this miscreant should escape,
    But wished you to suppress such gusts of passion,
    That we more surely might devise together
    His taking off.

    _Doge_.         No, nephew, he must live;
    At least, just now--a life so vile as his
    Were nothing at this hour; in th' olden time[dd]
    Some sacrifices asked a single victim,                             230
    Great expiations had a hecatomb.

    _Ber. F._ Your wishes are my law: and yet I fain
    Would prove to you how near unto my heart
    The honour of our house must ever be.

    _Doge_. Fear not; you shall have time and place of proof:
    But be not thou too rash, as I have been.
    I am ashamed of my own anger now;
    I pray you, pardon me.

    _Ber. F._              Why, that's my uncle!
    The leader, and the statesman, and the chief
    Of commonwealths, and sovereign of himself!                        240
    I wondered to perceive you so forget
    All prudence in your fury at these years,
    Although the cause--

    _Doge_.              Aye--think upon the cause--
    Forget it not:--When you lie down to rest,
    Let it be black among your dreams; and when
    The morn returns, so let it stand between
    The Sun and you, as an ill-omened cloud
    Upon a summer-day of festival:
    So will it stand to me;--but speak not, stir not,--
    Leave all to me; we shall have much to do,                         250
    And you shall have a part.--But now retire,
    'Tis fit I were alone.

    _Ber. F._ (_taking up and placing the ducal bonnet on the table_).
                           Ere I depart,
    I pray you to resume what you have spurned,
    Till you can change it--haply, for a crown!
    And now I take my leave, imploring you
    In all things to rely upon my duty,
    As doth become your near and faithful kinsman,
    And not less loyal citizen and subject.
                                                  [Exit BERTUCCIO FALIERO.

    _Doge_ (_solus_). Adieu, my worthy nephew.--Hollow bauble!
                                               [_Taking up the ducal cap_.
    Beset with all the thorns that line a crown,                       260
    Without investing the insulted brow
    With the all-swaying majesty of Kings;
    Thou idle, gilded, and degraded toy,
    Let me resume thee as I would a vizor.                  [_Puts it on_.
    How my brain aches beneath thee! and my temples
    Throb feverish under thy dishonest weight.
    Could I not turn thee to a diadem?
    Could I not shatter the Briarean sceptre
    Which in this hundred-handed Senate rules,
    Making the people nothing, and the Prince                          270
    A pageant? In my life I have achieved
    Tasks not less difficult--achieved for them,
    Who thus repay me! Can I not requite them?
    Oh for one year! Oh! but for even a day
    Of my full youth, while yet my body served
    My soul as serves the generous steed his lord,
    I would have dashed amongst them, asking few
    In aid to overthrow these swoln patricians;
    But now I must look round for other hands
    To serve this hoary head; but it shall plan                        280
    In such a sort as will not leave the task
    Herculean, though as yet 'tis but a chaos
    Of darkly brooding thoughts: my fancy is
    In her first work, more nearly to the light
    Holding the sleeping images of things
    For the selection of the pausing judgment.--
    The troops are few in----

                            _Enter_ VINCENZO.

    _Vin_.                     There is one without
    Craves audience of your Highness.

    _Doge_.                           I'm unwell--
    I can see no one, not even a patrician--
    Let him refer his business to the Council.                         290

    _Vin_. My Lord, I will deliver your reply;
    It cannot much import--he's a plebeian,
    The master of a galley, I believe.

    _Doge_. How! did you say the patron of a galley?[389]
    That is--I mean--a servant of the state:
    Admit him, he may be on public service.
                                                         [_Exit_ VINCENZO.

    _Doge_ (_solus_). This patron may be sounded; I will try him.
    I know the people to be discontented:
    They have cause, since Sapienza's[390] adverse day,
    When Genoa conquered: they have further cause,                     300
    Since they are nothing in the state, and in
    The city worse than nothing--mere machines,
    To serve the nobles' most patrician pleasure.
    The troops have long arrears of pay, oft promised,
    And murmur deeply--any hope of change
    Will draw them forward: they shall pay themselves
    With plunder:--but the priests--I doubt the priesthood
    Will not be with us; they have hated me
    Since that rash hour, when, maddened with the drone,
    I smote the tardy Bishop at Treviso,[391]                          310
    Quickening his holy march; yet, ne'ertheless,
    They may be won, at least their Chief at Rome,
    By some well-timed concessions; but, above
    All things, I must be speedy: at my hour
    Of twilight little light of life remains.
    Could I free Venice, and avenge my wrongs,
    I had lived too long, and willingly would sleep
    Next moment with my sires; and, wanting this,
    Better that sixty of my fourscore years
    Had been already where--how soon, I care not--                     320
    The whole must be extinguished;--better that
    They ne'er had been, than drag me on to be
    The thing these arch-oppressors fain would make me.
    Let me consider--of efficient troops
    There are three thousand posted at----

                 _Enter_ VINCENZO _and_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO.

    _Vin_.                                 May it please
    Your Highness, the same patron whom I spake of
    Is here to crave your patience.

    _Doge_.                        Leave the chamber,
    Vincenzo.--
                                                         [_Exit_ VINCENZO.
                Sir, you may advance--what would you?

    _I. Ber_.  Redress.

    _Doge_.             Of whom?

    _I. Ber_.                    Of God and of the Doge.

    _Doge_. Alas! my friend, you seek it of the twain                  330
    Of least respect and interest in Venice.
    You must address the Council.

    _I. Ber_.                    'Twere in vain;
    For he who injured me is one of them.

    _Doge_. There's blood upon thy face--how came it there?

    _I. Ber_. 'Tis mine, and not the first I've shed for Venice,
    But the first shed by a Venetian hand:
    A noble smote me.

    _Doge_.          Doth he live?

    _I. Ber_.                     Not long--
    But for the hope I had and have, that you,
    My Prince, yourself a soldier, will redress
    Him, whom the laws of discipline and Venice                        340
    Permit not to protect himself:--if not--
    I say no more.

    _Doge_.        But something you would do--
    Is it not so?

    _I. Ber_.     I am a man, my Lord.

    _Doge_. Why so is he who smote you.

    _I. Ber_.                          He is called so;
    Nay, more, a noble one--at least, in Venice:
    But since he hath forgotten that I am one,
    And treats me like a brute, the brute may turn--
    'Tis said the worm will.

    _Doge_.                 Say--his name and lineage?

    _I. Ber_. Barbaro.

    _Doge_.           What was the cause? or the pretext?

    _I. Ber_. I am the chief of the arsenal,[392] employed             350
    At present in repairing certain galleys
    But roughly used by the Genoese last year.
    This morning comes the noble Barbaro[393]
    Full of reproof, because our artisans
    Had left some frivolous order of his house,
    To execute the state's decree: I dared
    To justify the men--he raised his hand;--
    Behold my blood! the first time it e'er flowed
    Dishonourably.

    _Doge_.        Have you long time served?

    _I. Ber_. So long as to remember Zara's siege,                     360
    And fight beneath the Chief who beat the Huns there,
    Sometime my general, now the Doge Faliero.--

    _Doge_. How! are we comrades?--the State's ducal robes
    Sit newly on me, and you were appointed
    Chief of the arsenal ere I came from Rome;
    So that I recognised you not. Who placed you?

    _I. Ber_. The late Doge; keeping still my old command
    As patron of a galley: my new office
    Was given as the reward of certain scars
    (So was your predecessor pleased to say):                          370
    I little thought his bounty would conduct me
    To his successor as a helpless plaintiff;
    At least, in such a cause.

    _Doge_.                   Are you much hurt?

    _I. Ber_. Irreparably in my self-esteem.

    _Doge_. Speak out; fear nothing: being stung at heart,
    What would you do to be revenged on this man?

    _I. Ber_. That which I dare not name, and yet will do.

    _Doge_. Then wherefore came you here?

    _I. Ber_.                             I come for justice,
    Because my general is Doge, and will not
    See his old soldier trampled on. Had any,                          380
    Save Faliero, filled the ducal throne,
    This blood had been washed out in other blood.

    _Doge_. You come to me for justice--unto _me!_
    The Doge of Venice, and I cannot give it;
    I cannot even obtain it--'twas denied
    To me most solemnly an hour ago!

    _I. Ber_. How says your Highness?

    _Doge_.                           Steno is condemned
    To a month's confinement.

    _I. Ber_.                 What! the same who dared
    To stain the ducal throne with those foul words,
    That have cried shame to every ear in Venice?                      390

    _Doge_. Aye, doubtless they have echoed o'er the arsenal,
    Keeping due time with every hammer's clink,
    As a good jest to jolly artisans;
    Or making chorus to the creaking oar,
    In the vile tune of every galley-slave,
    Who, as he sung the merry stave, exulted
    _He_ was not a shamed dotard like the Doge.

    _I. Ber_. Is't possible? a month's imprisonment!
    No more for Steno?

    _Doge_.           You have heard the offence,
    And now you know his punishment; and then                          400
    You ask redress of _me_! Go to the Forty,
    Who passed the sentence upon Michel Steno;
    They'll do as much by Barbaro, no doubt.

    _I. Ber_. Ah! dared I speak my feelings!

    _Doge_.                                 Give them breath.
    Mine have no further outrage to endure.

    _I. Ber_. Then, in a word, it rests but on your word
    To punish and avenge--I will not say
    _My_ petty wrong, for what is a mere blow,
    However vile, to such a thing as I am?--
    But the base insult done your state and person.                    410

    _Doge_. You overrate my power, which is a pageant.
    This Cap is not the Monarch's crown; these robes
    Might move compassion, like a beggar's rags;
    Nay, more, a beggar's are his own, and these
    But lent to the poor puppet, who must play
    Its part with all its empire in this ermine.

    _I. Ber_. Wouldst thou be King?

    _Doge_.                        Yes--of a happy people.

    _I. Ber_. Wouldst thou be sovereign lord of Venice?

    _Doge_.                                            Aye,
    If that the people shared that sovereignty,
    So that nor they nor I were further slaves                         420
    To this o'ergrown aristocratic Hydra,[394]
    The poisonous heads of whose envenomed body
    Have breathed a pestilence upon us all.

    _I. Ber_. Yet, thou wast born, and still hast lived, patrician.

    _Doge_. In evil hour was I so born; my birth
    Hath made me Doge to be insulted: but
    I lived and toiled a soldier and a servant
    Of Venice and her people, not the Senate;
    Their good and my own honour were my guerdon.
    I have fought and bled; commanded, aye, and conquered;             430
    Have made and marred peace oft in embassies,
    As it might chance to be our country's 'vantage;
    Have traversed land and sea in constant duty,
    Through almost sixty years, and still for Venice,
    My fathers' and my birthplace, whose dear spires,
    Rising at distance o'er the blue Lagoon,
    It was reward enough for me to view
    Once more; but not for any knot of men,
    Nor sect, nor faction, did I bleed or sweat!
    But would you know why I have done all this?                       440
    Ask of the bleeding pelican why she
    Hath ripped her bosom? Had the bird a voice,
    She'd tell thee 'twas for _all_ her little ones.

    _I. Ber_. And yet they made thee Duke.

    _Doge_.                           _They made_ me so;
    I sought it not, the flattering fetters met me
    Returning from my Roman embassy,
    And never having hitherto refused
    Toil, charge, or duty for the state, I did not,
    At these late years, decline what was the highest
    Of all in seeming, but of all most base                            450
    In what we have to do and to endure:
    Bear witness for me thou, my injured subject,
    When I can neither right myself nor thee.

    _I. Ber_. You shall do both, if you possess the will;
    And many thousands more not less oppressed,
    Who wait but for a signal--will you give it?

    _Doge_. You speak in riddles.

    _I. Ber_.                     Which shall soon be read
    At peril of my life--if you disdain not
    To lend a patient ear.

    _Doge_.               Say on.

    _I. Ber_.                       Not thou,
    Nor I alone, are injured and abused,                               460
    Contemned and trampled on; but the whole people
    Groan with the strong conception of their wrongs:
    The foreign soldiers in the Senate's pay
    Are discontented for their long arrears;
    The native mariners, and civic troops,
    Feel with their friends; for who is he amongst them
    Whose brethren, parents, children, wives, or sisters,
    Have not partook[395] oppression, or pollution,
    From the patricians? And the hopeless war
    Against the Genoese, which is still maintained                     470
    With the plebeian blood, and treasure wrung
    From their hard earnings, has inflamed them further:
    Even now--but, I forget that speaking thus,
    Perhaps I pass the sentence of my death!

    _Doge_. And suffering what thou hast done--fear'st thou death?
    Be silent then, and live on, to be beaten
    By those for whom thou hast bled.

    _I. Ber_.                       No, I will speak
    At every hazard; and if Venice' Doge
    Should turn delator, be the shame on him,
    And sorrow too; for he will lose far more                          480
    Than I.

    _Doge_. From me fear nothing; out with it!

    _I. Ber_. Know then, that there are met and sworn in secret
    A band of brethren, valiant hearts and true;
    Men who have proved all fortunes, and have long
    Grieved over that of Venice, and have right
    To do so; having served her in all climes,
    And having rescued her from foreign foes,
    Would do the same from those within her walls.
    They are not numerous, nor yet too few
    For their great purpose; they have arms, and means,                490
    And hearts, and hopes, and faith, and patient courage.

    _Doge_. For what then do they pause?

    _I. Ber_.                           An hour to strike.

    _Doge_ (_aside_). Saint Mark's shall strike that hour![396]

    _I. Ber_.                                    I now have placed
    My life, my honour, all my earthly hopes
    Within thy power, but in the firm belief
    That injuries like ours, sprung from one cause,
    Will generate one vengeance: should it be so,
    Be our Chief now--our Sovereign hereafter.

    _Doge_. How many are ye?

    _I. Ber_.               I'll not answer that
    Till I am answered.

    _Doge_.            How, sir! do you menace?                        500

    _I. Ber_. No; I affirm. I have betrayed myself;
    But there's no torture in the mystic wells
    Which undermine your palace, nor in those
    Not less appalling cells, the "leaden roofs,"
    To force a single name from me of others.
    The Pozzi[397] and the Piombi were in vain;
    They might wring blood from me, but treachery never.
    And I would pass the fearful "Bridge of Sighs,"
    Joyous that mine must be the last that e'er
    Would echo o'er the Stygian wave which flows                       510
    Between the murderers and the murdered, washing
    The prison and the palace walls: there are
    Those who would live to think on't, and avenge me.

    _Doge_. If such your power and purpose, why come here
    To sue for justice, being in the course
    To do yourself due right?

    _I. Ber_.                 Because the man,
    Who claims protection from authority,
    Showing his confidence and his submission
    To that authority, can hardly be
    Suspected of combining to destroy it.                              520
    Had I sate down too humbly with this blow,
    A moody brow and muttered threats had made me
    A marked man to the Forty's inquisition;
    But loud complaint, however angrily
    It shapes its phrase, is little to be feared,
    And less distrusted. But, besides all this,
    I had another reason.

    _Doge_.              What was that?

    _I. Ber_. Some rumours that the Doge was greatly moved
    By the reference of the Avogadori
    Of Michel Steno's sentence to the Forty                            530
    Had reached me. I had served you, honoured you,
    And felt that you were dangerously insulted,
    Being of an order of such spirits, as
    Requite tenfold both good and evil: 'twas
    My wish to prove and urge you to redress.
    Now you know all; and that I speak the truth,
    My peril be the proof.

    _Doge_.                 You have deeply ventured;
    But all must do so who would greatly win:
    Thus far I'll answer you--your secret's safe.

    _I. Ber_. And is this all?

    _Doge_.                   Unless with all intrusted,               540
    What would you have me answer?

    _I. Ber_.                     I would have you
    Trust him who leaves his life in trust with you.

    _Doge_. But I must know your plan, your names, and numbers;
    The last may then be doubled, and the former
    Matured and strengthened.

    _I. Ber_.                We're enough already;
    You are the sole ally we covet now.

    _Doge_. But bring me to the knowledge of your chiefs.

    _I. Ber_. That shall be done upon your formal pledge
    To keep the faith that we will pledge to you.

    _Doge_. When? where?

    _I. Ber_.           This night I'll bring to your apartment        550
    Two of the principals: a greater number
    Were hazardous.

    _Doge_.        Stay, I must think of this.--
    What if I were to trust myself amongst you,
    And leave the palace?

    _I. Ber_.            You must come alone.

    _Doge_. With but my nephew.

    _I. Ber_.                  Not were he your son!

    _Doge_. Wretch! darest thou name my son? He died in arms
    At Sapienza[398] for this faithless state.
    Oh! that he were alive, and I in ashes!
    Or that he were alive ere I be ashes!
    I should not need the dubious aid of strangers.                    560

    _I. Ber_. Not one of all those strangers whom thou doubtest,
    But will regard thee with a filial feeling,
    So that thou keep'st a father's faith with them.

    _Doge_. The die is cast. Where is the place of meeting?

    _I. Ber_. At midnight I will be alone and masked
    Where'er your Highness pleases to direct me,
    To wait your coming, and conduct you where
    You shall receive our homage, and pronounce
    Upon our project.

    _Doge_.           At what hour arises
    The moon?

    _I. Ber_.  Late, but the atmosphere is thick and dusky,          570
    'Tis a sirocco.

    _Doge_.           At the midnight hour, then,
    Near to the church where sleep my sires;[399] the same,
    Twin-named from the apostles John and Paul;
    A gondola,[400] with one oar only, will
    Lurk in the narrow channel which glides by.
    Be there.

    _I. Ber_. I will not fail.

    _Doge_.                     And now retire----

    _I. Ber_. In the full hope your Highness will not falter
    In your great purpose. Prince, I take my leave.
                                                 [_Exit_ Isreal Bertuccio.

    _Doge_ (_solus_). At midnight, by the church Saints John and Paul,
    Where sleep my noble fathers, I repair--                           580
    To what? to hold a council in the dark
    With common ruffians leagued to ruin states!
    And will not my great sires leap from the vault,
    Where lie two Doges who preceded me,
    And pluck me down amongst them? Would they could!
    For I should rest in honour with the honoured.
    Alas! I must not think of them, but those
    Who have made me thus unworthy of a name
    Noble and brave as aught of consular
    On Roman marbles; but I will redeem it                             590
    Back to its antique lustre in our annals,
    By sweet revenge on all that's base in Venice,
    And freedom to the rest, or leave it black
    To all the growing calumnies of Time,
    Which never spare the fame of him who fails,
    But try the Cæsar, or the Catiline,
    By the true touchstone of desert--Success.[401]




                                 ACT II.


              SCENE I.--_An Apartment in the Ducal Palace_.

           ANGIOLINA[402] (_wife of the_ DOGE) _and_ MARIANNA.

    _Ang_. What was the Doge's answer?

    _Mar_.                            That he was
    That moment summoned to a conference;
    But 'tis by this time ended. I perceived
    Not long ago the Senators embarking;
    And the last gondola may now be seen
    Gliding into the throng of barks which stud
    The glittering waters.

    _Ang_.                Would he were returned!
    He has been much disquieted of late;
    And Time, which has not tamed his fiery spirit,
    Nor yet enfeebled even his mortal frame,                            10
    Which seems to be more nourished by a soul
    So quick and restless that it would consume
    Less hardy clay--Time has but little power
    On his resentments or his griefs. Unlike
    To other spirits of his order, who,
    In the first burst of passion, pour away
    Their wrath or sorrow, all things wear in him
    An aspect of Eternity: his thoughts,
    His feelings, passions, good or evil, all
    Have nothing of old age;[403] and his bold brow                     20
    Bears but the scars of mind, the thoughts of years,
    Not their decrepitude: and he of late
    Has been more agitated than his wont.
    Would he were come! for I alone have power
    Upon his troubled spirit.

    _Mar_.                    It is true,
    His Highness has of late been greatly moved
    By the affront of Steno, and with cause:
    But the offender doubtless even now
    Is doomed to expiate his rash insult with
    Such chastisement as will enforce respect                           30
    To female virtue, and to noble blood.

    _Ang_. 'Twas a gross insult; but I heed it not
    For the rash scorner's falsehood in itself,
    But for the effect, the deadly deep impression
    Which it has made upon Faliero's soul,
    The proud, the fiery, the austere--austere
    To all save me: I tremble when I think
    To what it may conduct.

    _Mar_.                  Assuredly
    The Doge can not suspect you?

    _Ang_.                        Suspect _me!_
    Why Steno dared not: when he scrawled his lie,                      40
    Grovelling by stealth in the moon's glimmering light,
    His own still conscience smote him for the act,
    And every shadow on the walls frowned shame
    Upon his coward calumny.

    _Mar_.                   'Twere fit
    He should be punished grievously.

    _Ang_.                            He is so.

    _Mar_. What! is the sentence passed? is he condemned?[de]

    _Ang_. I know not that, but he has been detected.

    _Mar_. And deem you this enough for such foul scorn?

    _Ang_. I would not be a judge in my own cause,
    Nor do I know what sense of punishment                              50
    May reach the soul of ribalds such as Steno;
    But if his insults sink no deeper in
    The minds of the inquisitors than they
    Have ruffled mine, he will, for all acquittance,
    Be left to his own shamelessness or shame.

    _Mar_. Some sacrifice is due to slandered virtue.

    _Ang_. Why, what is virtue if it needs a victim?
    Or if it must depend upon men's words?
    The dying Roman said, "'twas but a name:"[404]
    It were indeed no more, if human breath                             60
    Could make or mar it.

    _Mar_.                Yet full many a dame,
    Stainless and faithful, would feel all the wrong
    Of such a slander; and less rigid ladies,
    Such as abound in Venice, would be loud
    And all-inexorable in their cry
    For justice.

    _Ang_.       This but proves it is the name
    And not the quality they prize: the first
    Have found it a hard task to hold their honour,
    If they require it to be blazoned forth;
    And those who have not kept it, seek its seeming                    70
    As they would look out for an ornament
    Of which they feel the want, but not because
    They think it so; they live in others' thoughts,
    And would seem honest as they must seem fair.

    _Mar_. You have strange thoughts for a patrician dame.

    _Ang_. And yet they were my father's; with his name,
    The sole inheritance he left.

    _Mar_.                        You want none;
    Wife to a Prince, the Chief of the Republic.

    _Ang_. I should have sought none though a peasant's bride,
    But feel not less the love and gratitude                            80
    Due to my father, who bestowed my hand
    Upon his early, tried, and trusted friend,
    The Count Val di Marino, now our Doge.

    _Mar_. And with that hand did he bestow your heart?

    _Ang_. He did so, or it had not been bestowed.

    _Mar_. Yet this strange disproportion in your years,
    And, let me add, disparity of tempers,
    Might make the world doubt whether such an union
    Could make you wisely, permanently happy.

    _Ang_. The world will think with worldlings; but my heart           90
    Has still been in my duties, which are many,
    But never difficult.

    _Mar_.               And do you love him?

    _Ang_. I love all noble qualities which merit
    Love, and I loved my father, who first taught me
    To single out what we should love in others,
    And to subdue all tendency to lend
    The best and purest feelings of our nature
    To baser passions. He bestowed my hand
    Upon Faliero: he had known him noble,
    Brave, generous; rich in all the qualities                         100
    Of soldier, citizen, and friend; in all
    Such have I found him as my father said.
    His faults are those that dwell in the high bosoms
    Of men who have commanded; too much pride,
    And the deep passions fiercely fostered by
    The uses of patricians, and a life
    Spent in the storms of state and war; and also
    From the quick sense of honour, which becomes
    A duty to a certain sign, a vice
    When overstrained, and this I fear in him.                         110
    And then he has been rash from his youth upwards,
    Yet tempered by redeeming nobleness
    In such sort, that the wariest of republics
    Has lavished all its chief employs upon him,
    From his first fight to his last embassy,
    From which on his return the Dukedom met him.

    _Mar_. But previous to this marriage, had your heart
    Ne'er beat for any of the noble youth,
    Such as in years had been more meet to match
    Beauty like yours? or, since, have you ne'er seen                  120
    One, who, if your fair hand were still to give,
    Might now pretend to Loredano's daughter?

    _Ang_. I answered your first question when I said
    I married.

    _Mar_.      And the second?

    _Ang_.                     Needs no answer.

    _Mar_. I pray you pardon, if I have offended.

    _Ang_. I feel no wrath, but some surprise: I knew not
    That wedded bosoms could permit themselves
    To ponder upon what they _now_ might choose,
    Or aught save their past choice.

    _Mar_.                           'Tis their past choice
    That far too often makes them deem they would                      130
    Now choose more wisely, could they cancel it.

    _Ang_. It may be so. I knew not of such thoughts.

    _Mar_. Here comes the Doge--shall I retire?

    _Ang_.                                      It may
    Be better you should quit me; he seems rapt
    In thought.--How pensively he takes his way!
                                                         [_Exit_ MARIANNA.

                      _Enter the_ DOGE _and_ PIETRO.

    _Doge_ (_musing_). There is a certain Philip Calendaro
    Now in the Arsenal, who holds command
    Of eighty men, and has great influence
    Besides on all the spirits of his comrades:
    This man, I hear, is bold and popular,                             140
    Sudden and daring, and yet secret; 'twould
    Be well that he were won: I needs must hope
    That Israel Bertuccio has secured him,
    But fain would be----

    _Pie_.               My Lord, pray pardon me
    For breaking in upon your meditation;
    The Senator Bertuccio, your kinsman,
    Charged me to follow and enquire your pleasure
    To fix an hour when he may speak with you.

    _Doge_. At sunset.--Stay a moment--let me see--
    Say in the second hour of night.                       [_Exit_ PIETRO.

    _Ang_.                           My Lord!                          150

    _Doge_. My dearest child, forgive me--why delay
    So long approaching me?--I saw you not.

    _Ang_. You were absorbed in thought, and he who now
    Has parted from you might have words of weight
    To bear you from the Senate.

    _Doge_.                     From the Senate?

    _Ang_. I would not interrupt him in his duty
    And theirs.

    _Doge_.    The Senate's duty! you mistake;
    'Tis we who owe all service to the Senate.

    _Ang_. I thought the Duke had held command in Venice.

    _Doge_. He shall.--But let that pass.--We will be jocund.          160
    How fares it with you? have you been abroad?
    The day is overcast, but the calm wave
    Favours the gondolier's light skimming oar;
    Or have you held a levee of your friends?
    Or has your music made you solitary?
    Say--is there aught that you would will within
    The little sway now left the Duke? or aught
    Of fitting splendour, or of honest pleasure,
    Social or lonely, that would glad your heart,
    To compensate for many a dull hour, wasted                         170
    On an old man oft moved with many cares?
    Speak, and 'tis done.

    _Ang_.               You're ever kind to me.
    I have nothing to desire, or to request,
    Except to see you oftener and calmer.

    _Doge_. Calmer?

    _Ang_.         Aye, calmer, my good Lord.--Ah, why
    Do you still keep apart, and walk alone,
    And let such strong emotions stamp your brow,
    As not betraying their full import, yet
    Disclose too much?

    _Doge_.            Disclose too much!--of what?
    What is there to disclose?

    _Ang_.                    A heart so ill                           180
    At ease.

    _Doge_.    'Tis nothing, child.--But in the state
    You know what daily cares oppress all those
    Who govern this precarious commonwealth;
    Now suffering from the Genoese without,
    And malcontents within--'tis this which makes me
    More pensive and less tranquil than my wont.

    _Ang_. Yet this existed long before, and never
    Till in these late days did I see you thus.
    Forgive me; there is something at your heart
    More than the mere discharge of public duties,                     190
    Which long use and a talent like to yours
    Have rendered light, nay, a necessity,
    To keep your mind from stagnating. 'Tis not
    In hostile states, nor perils, thus to shake you,--
    You, who have stood all storms and never sunk,
    And climbed up to the pinnacle of power
    And never fainted by the way, and stand
    Upon it, and can look down steadily
    Along the depth beneath, and ne'er feel dizzy.
    Were Genoa's galleys riding in the port,                           200
    Were civil fury raging in Saint Mark's,
    You are not to be wrought on, but would fall,
    As you have risen, with an unaltered brow:
    Your feelings now are of a different kind;
    Something has stung your pride, not patriotism.

    _Doge_. Pride! Angiolina? Alas! none is left me.

    _Ang_. Yes--the same sin that overthrew the angels,
    And of all sins most easily besets
    Mortals the nearest to the angelic nature:
    The vile are only vain; the great are proud.                       210

    _Doge_. I _had_ the pride of honour, of _your_ honour,
    Deep at my heart--But let us change the theme.

    _Ang_. Ah no!--As I have ever shared your kindness
    In all things else, let me not be shut out
    From your distress: were it of public import,
    You know I never sought, would never seek
    To win a word from you; but feeling now
    Your grief is private, it belongs to me
    To lighten or divide it. Since the day
    When foolish Steno's ribaldry detected                             220
    Unfixed your quiet, you are greatly changed,
    And I would soothe you back to what you were.

    _Doge_. To what I was!--have you heard Steno's sentence?

    _Ang_. No.

    _Doge_.     A month's arrest.

    _Ang_.                        Is it not enough?

    _Doge_. Enough!--yes, for a drunken galley slave,
    Who, stung by stripes, may murmur at his master;
    But not for a deliberate, false, cool villain,
    Who stains a Lady's and a Prince's honour
    Even on the throne of his authority.

    _Ang_. There seems to be enough in the conviction                  230
    Of a patrician guilty of a falsehood:
    All other punishment were light unto
    His loss of honour.

    _Doge_.             Such men have no honour;
    They have but their vile lives--and these are spared.

    _Ang_. You would not have him die for this offence?

    _Doge_. Not _now_:--being still alive, I'd have him live
    Long as _he_ can; he has ceased to merit death;
    The guilty saved hath damned his hundred judges,
    And he is pure, for now his crime is theirs.

    _Ang_. Oh! had this false and flippant libeller                    240
    Shed his young blood for his absurd lampoon,
    Ne'er from that moment could this breast have known
    A joyous hour, or dreamless slumber more.

    _Doge_. Does not the law of Heaven say blood for blood?
    And he who _taints_ kills more than he who sheds it.
    Is it the _pain_ of blows, or _shame_ of blows,
    That makes such deadly to the sense of man?
    Do not the laws of man say blood for honour,--
    And, less than honour, for a little gold?
    Say not the laws of nations blood for treason?                     250
    Is't nothing to have filled these veins with poison
    For their once healthful current? is it nothing
    To have stained your name and mine--the noblest names?
    Is't nothing to have brought into contempt
    A Prince before his people? to have failed
    In the respect accorded by Mankind
    To youth in woman, and old age in man?
    To virtue in your sex, and dignity
    In ours?--But let them look to it who have saved him.

    _Ang_. Heaven bids us to forgive our enemies.                      260

    _Doge_. Doth Heaven forgive her own? Is there not Hell
    For wrath eternal?[df][405]

    _Ang_.                  Do not speak thus wildly--[dg]
    Heaven will alike forgive you and your foes.

    _Doge_. Amen! May Heaven forgive them!

    _Ang_.                                And will you?

    _Doge_. Yes, when they are in Heaven!

    _Ang_.                                And not till then?

    _Doge_. What matters my forgiveness? an old man's,
    Worn out, scorned, spurned, abused; what matters then
    My pardon more than my resentment, both
    Being weak and worthless? I have lived too long;
    But let us change the argument.--My child!                         270
    My injured wife, the child of Loredano,
    The brave, the chivalrous, how little deemed
    Thy father, wedding thee unto his friend,
    That he was linking thee to shame!--Alas!
    Shame without sin, for thou art faultless. Hadst thou
    But had a different husband, _any_ husband
    In Venice save the Doge, this blight, this brand,
    This blasphemy had never fallen upon thee.
    So young, so beautiful, so good, so pure,
    To suffer this, and yet be unavenged!                              280

    _Ang_. I am too well avenged, for you still love me,
    And trust, and honour me; and all men know
    That you are just, and I am true: what more
    Could I require, or you command?

    _Doge_.                          'Tis well,
    And may be better; but whate'er betide,
    Be thou at least kind to my memory.

    _Ang_. Why speak you thus?

    _Doge_.                    It is no matter why;
    But I would still, whatever others think,
    Have your respect both now and in my grave.

    _Ang_. Why should you doubt it? has it ever failed?                290

    _Doge_. Come hither, child! I would a word with you.
    Your father was my friend; unequal Fortune
    Made him my debtor for some courtesies
    Which bind the good more firmly: when, oppressed
    With his last malady, he willed our union,
    It was not to repay me, long repaid
    Before by his great loyalty in friendship;
    His object was to place your orphan beauty
    In honourable safety from the perils,
    Which, in this scorpion nest of vice, assail                       300
    A lonely and undowered maid. I did not
    Think with him, but would not oppose the thought
    Which soothed his death-bed.

    _Ang_.                       I have not forgotten
    The nobleness with which you bade me speak
    If my young heart held any preference
    Which would have made me happier; nor your offer
    To make my dowry equal to the rank
    Of aught in Venice, and forego all claim
    My father's last injunction gave you.

    _Doge_.                               Thus,
    'Twas not a foolish dotard's vile caprice,                         310
    Nor the false edge of agéd appetite,
    Which made me covetous of girlish beauty,
    And a young bride: for in my fieriest youth
    I swayed such passions; nor was this my age
    Infected with that leprosy of lust[406]
    Which taints the hoariest years of vicious men,
    Making them ransack to the very last
    The dregs of pleasure for their vanished joys;
    Or buy in selfish marriage some young victim,
    Too helpless to refuse a state that's honest,                      320
    Too feeling not to know herself a wretch.
    Our wedlock was not of this sort; you had
    Freedom from me to choose, and urged in answer
    Your father's choice.

    _Ang_.               I did so; I would do so
    In face of earth and Heaven; for I have never
    Repented for my sake; sometimes for yours,
    In pondering o'er your late disquietudes.

    _Doge_. I knew my heart would never treat you harshly:
    I knew my days could not disturb you long;
    And then the daughter of my earliest friend,                       330
    His worthy daughter, free to choose again.
    Wealthier and wiser, in the ripest bloom
    Of womanhood, more skilful to select
    By passing these probationary years,
    Inheriting a Prince's name and riches,
    Secured, by the short penance of enduring
    An old man for some summers, against all
    That law's chicane or envious kinsmen might
    Have urged against her right; my best friend's child
    Would choose more fitly in respect of years,                       340
    And not less truly in a faithful heart.

    _Ang_. My Lord, I looked but to my father's wishes,
    Hallowed by his last words, and to my heart
    For doing all its duties, and replying
    With faith to him with whom I was affianced.
    Ambitious hopes ne'er crossed my dreams; and should
    The hour you speak of come, it will be seen so.

    _Doge_. I do believe you; and I know you true:
    For Love--romantic Love--which in my youth
    I knew to be illusion, and ne'er saw                               350
    Lasting, but often fatal, it had been
    No lure for me, in my most passionate days,
    And could not be so now, did such exist.
    But such respect, and mildly paid regard
    As a true feeling for your welfare, and
    A free compliance with all honest wishes,--
    A kindness to your virtues, watchfulness
    Not shown, but shadowing o'er such little failings
    As Youth is apt in, so as not to check
    Rashly, but win you from them ere you knew                         360
    You had been won, but thought the change your choice;
    A pride not in your beauty, but your conduct;
    A trust in you; a patriarchal love,
    And not a doting homage; friendship, faith,--
    Such estimation in your eyes as these
    Might claim, I hoped for.

    _Ang_.                   And have ever had.

    _Doge_. I think so. For the difference in our years
    You knew it choosing me, and chose; I trusted
    Not to my qualities, nor would have faith
    In such, nor outward ornaments of nature,                          370
    Were I still in my five and twentieth spring;
    I trusted to the blood of Loredano[407]
    Pure in your veins; I trusted to the soul
    God gave you--to the truths your father taught you--
    To your belief in Heaven--to your mild virtues--
    To your own faith and honour, for my own.

    _Ang_. You have done well.--I thank you for that trust,
    Which I have never for one moment ceased
    To honour you the more for.

    _Doge_.                      Where is Honour,
    Innate and precept-strengthened, 'tis the rock                     380
    Of faith connubial: where it is not--where
    Light thoughts are lurking, or the vanities
    Of worldly pleasure rankle in the heart,
    Or sensual throbs convulse it, well I know
    'Twere hopeless for humanity to dream
    Of honesty in such infected blood,
    Although 'twere wed to him it covets most:
    An incarnation of the poet's God
    In all his marble-chiselled beauty, or
    The demi-deity, Alcides, in                                        390
    His majesty of superhuman Manhood,
    Would not suffice to bind where virtue is not;
    It is consistency which forms and proves it:
    Vice cannot fix, and Virtue cannot change.
    The once fall'n woman must for ever fall;
    For Vice must have variety, while Virtue
    Stands like the Sun, and all which rolls around
    Drinks life, and light, and glory from her aspect.

    _Ang_. And seeing, feeling thus this truth in others,
    (I pray you pardon me;) but wherefore yield you                    400
    To the most fierce of fatal passions, and
    Disquiet your great thoughts with restless hate
    Of such a thing as Steno?

    _Doge_.                  You mistake me.
    It is not Steno who could move me thus;
    Had it been so, he should--but let that pass.

    _Ang_. What is't you feel so deeply, then, even now?

    _Doge_. The violated majesty of Venice,
    At once insulted in her Lord and laws.

    _Ang_. Alas! why will you thus consider it?

    _Doge_. I have thought on't till--but let me lead you back         410
    To what I urged; all these things being noted,
    I wedded you; the world then did me justice
    Upon the motive, and my conduct proved
    They did me right, while yours was all to praise:
    You had all freedom--all respect--all trust
    From me and mine; and, born of those who made
    Princes at home, and swept Kings from their thrones
    On foreign shores, in all things you appeared
    Worthy to be our first of native dames.

    _Ang_. To what does this conduct?

    _Doge_.                           To thus much--that               420
    A miscreant's angry breath may blast it all--
    A villain, whom for his unbridled bearing,
    Even in the midst of our great festival,
    I caused to be conducted forth, and taught
    How to demean himself in ducal chambers;
    A wretch like this may leave upon the wall
    The blighting venom of his sweltering heart,
    And this shall spread itself in general poison;
    And woman's innocence, man's honour, pass
    Into a by-word; and the doubly felon                               430
    (Who first insulted virgin modesty
    By a gross affront to your attendant damsels
    Amidst the noblest of our dames in public)
    Requite himself for his most just expulsion
    By blackening publicly his Sovereign's consort,
    And be absolved by his upright compeers.

    _Ang_. But he has been condemned into captivity.

    _Doge_. For such as him a dungeon were acquittal;
    And his brief term of mock-arrest will pass
    Within a palace. But I've done with him;                           440
    The rest must be with you.

    _Ang_.                     With me, my Lord?

    _Doge_. Yes, Angiolina. Do not marvel; I
    Have let this prey upon me till I feel
    My life cannot be long; and fain would have you
    Regard the injunctions you will find within
    This scroll (_giving her a paper_)
               ----Fear not; they are for your advantage:
    Read them hereafter at the fitting hour.

    _Ang_. My Lord, in life, and after life, you shall
    Be honoured still by me: but may your days
    Be many yet--and happier than the present!                         450
    This passion will give way, and you will be
    Serene, and what you should be--what you were.

    _Doge_. I will be what I should be, or be nothing;
    But never more--oh! never, never more,
    O'er the few days or hours which yet await
    The blighted old age of Faliero, shall
    Sweet Quiet shed her sunset! Never more
    Those summer shadows rising from the past
    Of a not ill-spent nor inglorious life,
    Mellowing the last hours as the night approaches,                  460
    Shall soothe me to my moment of long rest.
    I had but little more to ask, or hope,
    Save the regards due to the blood and sweat,
    And the soul's labour through which I had toiled
    To make my country honoured. As her servant--
    Her servant, though her chief--I would have gone
    Down to my fathers with a name serene
    And pure as theirs; but this has been denied me.
    Would I had died at Zara!

    _Ang_.                   There you saved
    The state; then live to save her still. A day,                     470
    Another day like that would be the best
    Reproof to them, and sole revenge for you.

    _Doge_. But one such day occurs within an age;
    My life is little less than one, and 'tis
    Enough for Fortune to have granted _once_,
    That which scarce one more favoured citizen
    May win in many states and years. But why
    Thus speak I? Venice has forgot that day--
    Then why should I remember it?--Farewell,
    Sweet Angiolina! I must to my cabinet;                             480
    There's much for me to do--and the hour hastens.[408]

    _Ang_. Remember what you were.

    _Doge_.                        It were in vain!
    Joy's recollection is no longer joy,
    While Sorrow's memory is a sorrow still.

    _Ang_. At least, whate'er may urge, let me implore
    That you will take some little pause of rest:
    Your sleep for many nights has been so turbid,
    That it had been relief to have awaked you,
    Had I not hoped that Nature would o'erpower
    At length the thoughts which shook your slumbers thus.             490
    An hour of rest will give you to your toils
    With fitter thoughts and freshened strength.

    _Doge_.                                      I cannot--
    I must not, if I could; for never was
    Such reason to be watchful: yet a few--
    Yet a few days and dream-perturbéd nights,
    And I shall slumber well--but where?--no matter.
    Adieu, my Angiolina.

    _Ang_.                 Let me be
    An instant--yet an instant your companion!
    I cannot bear to leave you thus.

    _Doge_.                          Come then,
    My gentle child--forgive me: thou wert made                        500
    For better fortunes than to share in mine,
    Now darkling in their close toward the deep vale
    Where Death sits robed in his all-sweeping shadow.[dh]
    When I am gone--it may be sooner than
    Even these years warrant, for there is that stirring
    Within--above--around, that in this city
    Will make the cemeteries populous
    As e'er they were by pestilence or war,--
    When I _am_ nothing, let that which I _was_
    Be still sometimes a name on thy sweet lips,                       510
    A shadow in thy fancy, of a thing
    Which would not have thee mourn it, but remember.
    Let us begone, my child--the time is pressing.


              SCENE II.--_A retired spot near the Arsenal_.

              ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _and_ PHILIP CALENDARO.[409]

    _Cal_. How sped you, Israel, in your late complaint?

    _I. Ber_. Why, well.

    _Cal_.               Is't possible! will he be punished?

    _I. Ber_.                                                Yes.

    _Cal_. With what? a mulct or an arrest?

    _I. Ber_.                                With death!

    _Cal_. Now you rave, or must intend revenge,
    Such as I counselled you, with your own hand.

    _I. Ber_. Yes; and for one sole draught of hate, forego
    The great redress we meditate for Venice,
    And change a life of hope for one of exile;
    Leaving one scorpion crushed, and thousands stinging
    My friends, my family, my countrymen!                               10
    No, Calendaro; these same drops of blood,
    Shed shamefully, shall have the whole of his
    For their requital----But not only his;
    We will not strike for private wrongs alone:
    Such are for selfish passions and rash men,
    But are unworthy a Tyrannicide.

    _Cal_. You have more patience than I care to boast.
    Had I been present when you bore this insult,
    I must have slain him, or expired myself
    In the vain effort to repress my wrath.                             20

    _I. Ber_. Thank Heaven you were not--all had else been marred:
    As 'tis, our cause looks prosperous still.

    _Cal_.                                    You saw
    The Doge--what answer gave he?

    _I. Ber_.                     That there was
    No punishment for such as Barbaro.

    _Cal_. I told you so before, and that 'twas idle
    To think of justice from such hands.

    _I. Ber_.                           At least,
    It lulled suspicion, showing confidence.
    Had I been silent, not a Sbirro[410] but
    Had kept me in his eye, as meditating
    A silent, solitary, deep revenge.                                   30

    _Cal_. But wherefore not address you to the Council?
    The Doge is a mere puppet, who can scarce
    Obtain right for himself. Why speak to _him_?

    _I. Ber_. You shall know that hereafter.

    _Cal_.                                   Why not now?

    _I. Ber_. Be patient but till midnight. Get your musters,
    And bid our friends prepare their companies:
    Set all in readiness to strike the blow,
    Perhaps in a few hours: we have long waited
    For a fit time--that hour is on the dial,
    It may be, of to-morrow's sun: delay                                40
    Beyond may breed us double danger. See
    That all be punctual at our place of meeting,
    And armed, excepting those of the Sixteen,[411]
    Who will remain among the troops to wait
    The signal.

    _Cal_.      These brave words have breathed new life
    Into my veins; I am sick of these protracted
    And hesitating councils: day on day
    Crawled on, and added but another link
    To our long fetters, and some fresher wrong
    Inflicted on our brethren or ourselves,                             50
    Helping to swell our tyrants' bloated strength.
    Let us but deal upon them, and I care not
    For the result, which must be Death or Freedom!
    I'm weary to the heart of finding neither.

    _I. Ber_. We will be free in Life or Death! the grave
    Is chainless. Have you all the musters ready?
    And are the sixteen companies completed
    To sixty?

    _Cal_.    All save two, in which there are
    Twenty-five wanting to make up the number.

    _I. Ber_. No matter; we can do without. Whose are they?             60

    _Cal_. Bertram's[412] and old Soranzo's, both of whom
    Appear less forward in the cause than we are.

    _I. Ber_. Your fiery nature makes you deem all those
    Who are not restless cold; but there exists
    Oft in concentred spirits not less daring
    Than in more loud avengers. Do not doubt them.

    _Cat_. I do not doubt the elder; but in Bertram
    There is a hesitating softness, fatal
    To enterprise like ours: I've seen that man
    Weep like an infant o'er the misery                                 70
    Of others, heedless of his own, though greater;
    And in a recent quarrel I beheld him
    Turn sick at sight of blood, although a villain's.

    _I. Ber_. The truly brave are soft of heart and eyes,
    And feel for what their duty bids them do.
    I have known Bertram long; there doth not breathe
    A soul more full of honour.

    _Cal_.                       It may be so:
    I apprehend less treachery than weakness;
    Yet as he has no mistress, and no wife
    To work upon his milkiness of spirit,                               80
    He may go through the ordeal; it is well
    He is an orphan, friendless save in us:
    A woman or a child had made him less
    Than either in resolve.

    _I. Ber_.                Such ties are not
    For those who are called to the high destinies
    Which purify corrupted commonwealths;
    We must forget all feelings save the _one_,
    We must resign all passions save our purpose,
    We must behold no object save our country,
    And only look on Death as beautiful,                                90
    So that the sacrifice ascend to Heaven,
    And draw down Freedom on her evermore.

    _Cal_. But if we fail----[413]

    _I. Ber_.                They never fail who die
    In a great cause: the block may soak their gore:[di]
    Their heads may sodden in the sun; their limbs
    Be strung to city gates and castle walls--
    But still their Spirit walks abroad. Though years
    Elapse, and others share as dark a doom,
    They but augment the deep and sweeping thoughts
    Which overpower all others, and conduct                            100
    The world at last to Freedom. What were we,
    If Brutus had not lived? He died in giving[dj]
    Rome liberty, but left a deathless lesson--
    A name which is a virtue, and a Soul
    Which multiplies itself throughout all time,
    When wicked men wax mighty, and a state
    Turns servile. He and his high friend were styled
    "The last of Romans!"[414] Let us be the first
    Of true Venetians, sprung from Roman sires.

    _Cal_. Our fathers did not fly from Attila[415]                    110
    Into these isles, where palaces have sprung
    On banks redeemed from the rude ocean's ooze,
    To own a thousand despots in his place.
    Better bow down before the Hun, and call
    A Tartar lord, than these swoln silkworms[416] masters!
    The first at least was man, and used his sword
    As sceptre: these unmanly creeping things
    Command our swords, and rule us with a word
    As with a spell.

    _I. Ber_.        It shall be broken soon.
    You say that all things are in readiness;                          120
    To-day I have not been the usual round,
    And why thou knowest; but thy vigilance
    Will better have supplied my care: these orders
    In recent council to redouble now
    Our efforts to repair the galleys, have
    Lent a fair colour to the introduction
    Of many of our cause into the arsenal,
    As new artificers for their equipment,
    Or fresh recruits obtained in haste to man
    The hoped-for fleet.--Are all supplied with arms?                  130

    _Cal_. All who were deemed trust-worthy: there are some
    Whom it were well to keep in ignorance
    Till it be time to strike, and then supply them;
    When in the heat and hurry of the hour
    They have no opportunity to pause,
    But needs must on with those who will surround them.

    _I. Ber_. You have said well. Have you remarked all such?

    _Cal_. I've noted most; and caused the other chiefs
    To use like caution in their companies.
    As far as I have seen, we are enough                               140
    To make the enterprise secure, if 'tis
    Commenced to-morrow; but, till 'tis begun,
    Each hour is pregnant with a thousand perils.

    _I. Ber_. Let the Sixteen meet at the wonted hour,
    Except Soranzo, Nicoletto Blondo,
    And Marco Giuda, who will keep their watch
    Within the arsenal, and hold all ready,
    Expectant of the signal we will fix on.

    _Cal_. We will not fail.

    _I. Ber_.                 Let all the rest be there;
    I have a stranger to present to them.                              150

    _Cal_. A stranger! doth he know the secret?

    _I. Ber_.                                   Yes.

    _Cal_. And have you dared to peril your friends' lives
    On a rash confidence in one we know not?

    _I. Ber_. I have risked no man's life except my own--
    Of that be certain: he is one who may
    Make our assurance doubly sure, according[417]
    His aid; and if reluctant, he no less
    Is in our power: he comes alone with me,
    And cannot 'scape us; but he will not swerve.

    _Cal_. I cannot judge of this until I know him:                    160
    Is he one of our order?

    _I. Ber_.              Aye, in spirit,
    Although a child of Greatness; he is one
    Who would become a throne, or overthrow one--
    One who has done great deeds, and seen great changes;
    No tyrant, though bred up to tyranny;
    Valiant in war, and sage in council; noble
    In nature, although haughty; quick, yet wary:
    Yet for all this, so full of certain passions,
    That if once stirred and baffled, as he has been
    Upon the tenderest points, there is no Fury                        170
    In Grecian story like to that which wrings
    His vitals with her burning hands, till he
    Grows capable of all things for revenge;
    And add too, that his mind is liberal,
    He sees and feels the people are oppressed,
    And shares their sufferings. Take him all in all,
    We have need of such, and such have need of us.

    _Cal_. And what part would you have him take with us?

    _I. Ber_. It may be, that of Chief.

    _Cal_.                              What! and resign
    Your own command as leader?

    _I. Ber_.                  Even so.                                180
    My object is to make your cause end well,
    And not to push myself to power. Experience,
    Some skill, and your own choice, had marked me out
    To act in trust as your commander, till
    Some worthier should appear: if I have found such
    As you yourselves shall own more worthy, think you
    That I would hesitate from selfishness,
    And, covetous of brief authority,
    Stake our deep interest on my single thoughts,
    Rather than yield to one above me in                               190
    All leading qualities? No, Calendaro,
    Know your friend better; but you all shall judge.
    Away! and let us meet at the fixed hour.
    Be vigilant, and all will yet go well.

    _Cal_. Worthy Bertuccio, I have known you ever
    Trusty and brave, with head and heart to plan
    What I have still been prompt to execute.
    For my own part, I seek no other Chief;
    What the rest will decide, I know not, but
    I am with YOU, as I have ever been,                                200
    In all our undertakings. Now farewell,
    Until the hour of midnight sees us meet.                    [_Exeunt_.




                                 ACT III.


          SCENE I.--_Scene, the Space between the Canal and the
         Church of San Giovanni e San Paolo. An equestrian Statue
        before it.--A Gondola lies in the Canal at some distance._

                   _Enter the_ DOGE _alone, disguised_.

    _Doge_ (_solus_). I am before the hour, the hour whose voice,
    Pealing into the arch of night, might strike
    These palaces with ominous tottering,
    And rock their marbles to the corner-stone,
    Waking the sleepers from some hideous dream
    Of indistinct but awful augury
    Of that which will befall them. Yes, proud city!
    Thou must be cleansed of the black blood which makes thee
    A lazar-house of tyranny: the task
    Is forced upon me, I have sought it not;                            10
    And therefore was I punished, seeing this
    Patrician pestilence spread on and on,
    Until at length it smote me in my slumbers,
    And I am tainted, and must wash away
    The plague spots in the healing wave. Tall fane!
    Where sleep my fathers, whose dim statues shadow
    The floor which doth divide us from the dead,
    Where all the pregnant hearts of our bold blood,
    Mouldered into a mite of ashes, hold
    In one shrunk heap what once made many heroes,                      20
    When what is now a handful shook the earth--
    Fane of the tutelar saints who guard our house!
    Vault where two Doges rest[418]--my sires! who died
    The one of toil, the other in the field,
    With a long race of other lineal chiefs
    And sages, whose great labours, wounds, and state
    I have inherited,--let the graves gape,
    Till all thine aisles be peopled with the dead,
    And pour them from thy portals to gaze on me!
    I call them up, and them and thee to witness                        30
    What it hath been which put me to this task--
    Their pure high blood, their blazon-roll of glories,
    Their mighty name dishonoured all _in_ me,
    Not _by_ me, but by the ungrateful nobles
    We fought to make our equals, not our lords:[dk]
    And chiefly thou, Ordelafo the brave,
    Who perished in the field, where I since conquered,
    Battling at Zara, did the hecatombs
    Of thine and Venice' foes, there offered up
    By thy descendant, merit such acquittance?[dl]                      40
    Spirits! smile down upon me! for my cause
    Is yours, in all life now can be of yours,--
    Your fame, your name, all mingled up in mine,
    And in the future fortunes of our race!
    Let me but prosper, and I make this city
    Free and immortal, and our House's name
    Worthier of what you were--now and hereafter!

                        _Enter_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO.

    _I. Ber_. Who goes there?

    _Doge_.                  A friend to Venice.

    _I. Ber_.                                    'Tis he.
    Welcome, my Lord,--you are before the time.

    _Doge_. I am ready to proceed to your assembly.                     50

    _I. Ber_. Have with you.--I am proud and pleased to see
    Such confident alacrity. Your doubts
    Since our last meeting, then, are all dispelled?

    _Doge_. Not so--but I have set my little left[419]
    Of life upon this cast: the die was thrown
    When I first listened to your treason.--Start not!
    _That_ is the word; I cannot shape my tongue
    To syllable black deeds into smooth names,
    Though I be wrought on to commit them. When
    I heard you tempt your Sovereign, and forbore                       60
    To have you dragged to prison, I became
    Your guiltiest accomplice: now you may,
    If it so please you, do as much by me.

    _I. Ber_. Strange words, my Lord, and most unmerited;
    I am no spy, and neither are we traitors.

    _Doge_. _We--We!_--no matter--you have earned the right
    To talk of _us_.--But to the point.--If this
    Attempt succeeds, and Venice, rendered free
    And flourishing, when we are in our graves,
    Conducts her generations to our tombs,                              70
    And makes her children with their little hands
    Strew flowers o'er her deliverers' ashes, then
    The consequence will sanctify the deed,
    And we shall be like the two Bruti in
    The annals of hereafter; but if not,
    If we should fail, employing bloody means
    And secret plot, although to a good end,
    Still we are traitors, honest Israel;--thou
    No less than he who was thy Sovereign
    Six hours ago, and now thy brother rebel.                           80

    _I. Ber_. 'Tis not the moment to consider thus,
    Else I could answer.--Let us to the meeting,
    Or we may be observed in lingering here.

    _Doge_. We _are_ observed, and have been.

    _I. Ber_.                                 We observed!
    Let me discover--and this steel-----

    _Doge_.                         Put up;
    Here are no human witnesses: look there--
    What see you?

    _I. Ber_.    Only a tall warrior's statue[420]
    Bestriding a proud steed, in the dim light
    Of the dull moon.

    _Doge_.           That Warrior was the sire
    Of my sire's fathers, and that statue was                           90
    Decreed to him by the twice rescued city:--
    Think you that he looks down on us or no?

    _I. Ber_. My Lord, these are mere fantasies; there are
    No eyes in marble.

    _Doge_.       But there are in Death.
    I tell thee, man, there is a spirit in
    Such things that acts and sees, unseen, though felt;
    And, if there be a spell to stir the dead,
    'Tis in such deeds as we are now upon.
    Deem'st thou the souls of such a race as mine
    Can rest, when he, their last descendant Chief,                    100
    Stands plotting on the brink of their pure graves
    With stung plebeians?

    _I. Ber_.            It had been as well
    To have pondered this before,--ere you embarked
    In our great enterprise.--Do you repent?

    _Doge_. No--but I _feel_, and shall do to the last.
    I cannot quench a glorious life at once,
    Nor dwindle to the thing I now must be,[dm]
    And take men's lives by stealth, without some pause:
    Yet doubt me not; it is this very feeling,
    And knowing _what_ has wrung me to be thus,                        110
    Which is your best security. There's not
    A roused mechanic in your busy plot[dn]
    So wronged as I, so fall'n, so loudly called
    To his redress: the very means I am forced
    By these fell tyrants to adopt is such,
    That I abhor them doubly for the deeds
    Which I must do to pay them back for theirs.

    _I. Ber_. Let us away--hark--the Hour strikes.

    _Doge_.                                        On--on--
    It is our knell, or that of Venice.--On.

    _I. Ber_. Say rather, 'tis her Freedom's rising peal               120
    Of Triumph. This way--we are near the place.
                                                                [_Exeunt_.


           SCENE II.--_The House where the Conspirators meet._

          DAGOLINO, DORO, BERTRAM, FEDELE TREVISANO, CALENDARO,
                     ANTONIO DELLE BENDE, ETC., ETC.

    _Cal_. (_entering_). Are all here?

    _Dag_.                           All with you; except the three
    On duty, and our leader Israel,
    Who is expected momently.

    _Cal_.               Where's Bertram?

    _Ber_. Here!

    _Cal_.       Have you not been able to complete
    The number wanting in your company?

    _Ber_. I had marked out some: but I have not dared
    To trust them with the secret, till assured
    That they were worthy faith.

    _Cal_.                       There is no need
    Of trusting to their faith; _who_, save ourselves
    And our more chosen comrades, is aware                              10
    Fully of our intent? they think themselves
    Engaged in secret to the Signory,[421]
    To punish some more dissolute young nobles
    Who have defied the law in their excesses;
    But once drawn up, and their new swords well fleshed
    In the rank hearts of the more odious Senators,
    They will not hesitate to follow up
    Their blow upon the others, when they see
    The example of their chiefs, and I for one
    Will set them such, that they for very shame                        20
    And safety will not pause till all have perished.

    _Ber_. How say you? _all!_

    _Cal_.                     Whom wouldst thou spare?

    _Ber_.                                         _I spare?_
    I have no power to spare. I only questioned,
    Thinking that even amongst these wicked men
    There might be some, whose age and qualities
    Might mark them out for pity.

    _Cal_.                       Yes, such pity
    As when the viper hath been cut to pieces,
    The separate fragments quivering in the sun,
    In the last energy of venomous life,
    Deserve and have. Why, I should think as soon                       30
    Of pitying some particular fang which made
    One in the jaw of the swoln serpent, as
    Of saving one of these: they form but links
    Of one long chain; one mass, one breath, one body;
    They eat, and drink, and live, and breed together,
    Revel, and lie, oppress, and kill in concert,--
    So let them die as _one!_[do]

    _Dag_.                  Should _one_ survive,
    He would be dangerous as the whole; it is not
    Their number, be it tens or thousands, but
    The spirit of this Aristocracy                                      40
    Which must be rooted out; and if there were
    A single shoot of the old tree in life,
    'Twould fasten in the soil, and spring again
    To gloomy verdure and to bitter fruit.
    Bertram, we must be firm!

    _Cal_.                   Look to it well
    Bertram! I have an eye upon thee.

    _Ber_.                            Who
    Distrusts me?

    _Cal_.       Not I; for if I did so,
    Thou wouldst not now be there to talk of trust:
    It is thy softness, not thy want of faith,
    Which makes thee to be doubted.


    _Ber_.                         You should know                      50
    Who hear me, who and what I am; a man
    Roused like yourselves to overthrow oppression;
    A kind man, I am apt to think, as some
    Of you have found me; and if brave or no,
    You, Calendaro, can pronounce, who have seen me
    Put to the proof; or, if you should have doubts,
    I'll clear them on your person!

    _Cal_.                         You are welcome,
    When once our enterprise is o'er, which must not
    Be interrupted by a private brawl.

    _Ber_. I am no brawler; but can bear myself                         60
    As far among the foe as any he
    Who hears me; else why have I been selected
    To be of your chief comrades? but no less
    I own my natural weakness; I have not
    Yet learned to think of indiscriminate murder
    Without some sense of shuddering; and the sight
    Of blood which spouts through hoary scalps is not
    To me a thing of triumph, nor the death
    Of man surprised a glory. Well--too well
    I know that we must do such things on those                         70
    Whose acts have raised up such avengers; but
    If there were some of these who could be saved
    From out this sweeping fate, for our own sakes
    And for our honour, to take off some stain
    Of massacre, which else pollutes it wholly,
    I had been glad; and see no cause in this
    For sneer, nor for suspicion!

    _Dag_.                       Calm thee, Bertram,
    For we suspect thee not, and take good heart.
    It is the cause, and not our will, which asks
    Such actions from our hands: we'll wash away                        80
    All stains in Freedom's fountain!

          _Enter_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO, _and the_ DOGE, _disguised_.

    _Dag_.                            Welcome, Israel.

    _Consp_. Most welcome.--Brave Bertuccio, thou art late--
    Who is this stranger?

    _Cal_.               It is time to name him.
    Our comrades are even now prepared to greet him
    In brotherhood, as I have made it known
    That thou wouldst add a brother to our cause,
    Approved by thee, and thus approved by all,
    Such is our trust in all thine actions. Now
    Let him unfold himself.

    _I. Ber_.              Stranger, step forth!
                                            [_The Doge discovers himself_.

    _Consp_. To arms!--we are betrayed--it is the Doge!                 90
    Down with them both! our traitorous captain, and
    The tyrant he hath sold us to.

    _Cal_. (_drawing his sword_).  Hold! hold!
    Who moves a step against them dies. Hold! hear
    Bertuccio--What! are you appalled to see
    A lone, unguarded, weaponless old man
    Amongst you?--Israel, speak! what means this mystery?

    _I. Ber_. Let them advance and strike at their own bosoms,
    Ungrateful suicides! for on our lives
    Depend their own, their fortunes, and their hopes.

    _Doge_. Strike!--If I dreaded death, a death more fearful          100
    Than any your rash weapons can inflict,
    I should not now be here: Oh, noble Courage!
    The eldest born of Fear, which makes you brave
    Against this solitary hoary head!
    See the bold chiefs, who would reform a state
    And shake down senates, mad with wrath and dread
    At sight of one patrician! Butcher me!
    You can, I care not.--Israel, are these men
    The mighty hearts you spoke of? look upon them!

    _Cal_. Faith! he hath shamed us, and deservedly,                   110
    Was this your trust in your true Chief Bertuccio,
    To turn your swords against him and his guest?
    Sheathe them, and hear him.

    _I. Ber_.                   I disdain to speak.
    They might and must have known a heart like mine
    Incapable of treachery; and the power
    They gave me to adopt all fitting means
    To further their design was ne'er abused.
    They might be certain that who e'er was brought
    By me into this Council had been led
    To take his choice--as brother, or as victim.                      120

    _Doge_. And which am I to be? your actions leave
    Some cause to doubt the freedom of the choice.

    _I. Ber_. My Lord, we would have perished here together,
    Had these rash men proceeded; but, behold,
    They are ashamed of that mad moment's impulse,
    And droop their heads; believe me, they are such
    As I described them.--Speak to them.

    _Cal_.                              Aye, speak;
    We are all listening in wonder.[dp]

    _I. Ber_. (_addressing the conspirators_). You are safe,
    Nay, more, almost triumphant--listen then,
    And know my words for truth.

    _Doge_.                     You see me here,                       130
    As one of you hath said, an old, unarmed,
    Defenceless man; and yesterday you saw me
    Presiding in the hall of ducal state,
    Apparent Sovereign of our hundred isles,[dq][422]
    Robed in official purple, dealing out
    The edicts of a power which is not mine,
    Nor yours, but of our masters--the patricians.
    Why I was there you know, or think you know;
    Why I am _here_, he who hath been most wronged,
    He who among you hath been most insulted,                          140
    Outraged and trodden on, until he doubt
    If he be worm or no, may answer for me,
    Asking of his own heart what brought him here?
    You know my recent story, all men know it,
    And judge of it far differently from those
    Who sate in judgement to heap scorn on scorn.
    But spare me the recital--it is here,
    Here at my heart the outrage--but my words,
    Already spent in unavailing plaints,
    Would only show my feebleness the more,                            150
    And I come here to strengthen even the strong,
    And urge them on to deeds, and not to war
    With woman's weapons; but I need not urge you.
    Our private wrongs have sprung from public vices,
    In this--I cannot call it commonwealth,
    Nor kingdom, which hath neither prince nor people,
    But all the sins of the old Spartan state[dr]
    Without its virtues--temperance and valour.
    The Lords of Lacedæmon were true soldiers,[ds]
    But ours are Sybarites, while we are Helots,                       160
    Of whom I am the lowest, most enslaved;
    Although dressed out to head a pageant, as
    The Greeks of yore made drunk their slaves to form
    A pastime for their children. You are met
    To overthrow this Monster of a state,
    This mockery of a Government, this spectre,
    Which must be exorcised with blood,--and then
    We will renew the times of Truth and Justice,
    Condensing in a fair free commonwealth
    Not rash equality but equal rights,                                170
    Proportioned like the columns to the temple,
    Giving and taking strength reciprocal,
    And making firm the whole with grace and beauty,
    So that no part could be removed without
    Infringement of the general symmetry.
    In operating this great change, I claim
    To be one of you--if you trust in me;
    If not, strike home,--my life is compromised,
    And I would rather fall by freemen's hands
    Than live another day to act the tyrant                            180
    As delegate of tyrants: such I am not,
    And never have been--read it in our annals;
    I can appeal to my past government
    In many lands and cities; they can tell you
    If I were an oppressor, or a man
    Feeling and thinking for my fellow men.
    Haply had I been what the Senate sought,
    A thing of robes and trinkets,[423] dizened out
    To sit in state as for a Sovereign's picture;
    A popular scourge, a ready sentence-signer,                        190
    A stickler for the Senate and "the Forty,"
    A sceptic of all measures which had not
    The sanction of "the Ten,"[424] a council-fawner,
    A tool--a fool--a puppet,--they had ne'er
    Fostered the wretch who stung me. What I suffer
    Has reached me through my pity for the people;
    That many know, and they who know not yet
    Will one day learn: meantime I do devote,
    Whate'er the issue, my last days of life--
    My present power such as it is, not that                           200
    Of Doge, but of a man who has been great
    Before he was degraded to a Doge,
    And still has individual means and mind;
    I stake my fame (and I had fame)--my breath--
    (The least of all, for its last hours are nigh)
    My heart--my hope--my soul--upon this cast!
    Such as I am, I offer me to you
    And to your chiefs; accept me or reject me,--
    A Prince who fain would be a Citizen
    Or nothing, and who has left his throne to be so.                  210

    _Cal_. Long live Faliero!--Venice shall be free!

    _Consp_. Long live Faliero!

    _I. Ber_.                    Comrades! did I well?
    Is not this man a host in such a cause?

    _Doge_. This is no time for eulogies, nor place
    For exultation. Am I one of you?

    _Cal_. Aye, and the first among us, as thou hast been
    Of Venice--be our General and Chief.

    _Doge_. Chief!--General!--I was General at Zara,
    And Chief in Rhodes and Cyprus,[425] Prince in Venice:
    I cannot stoop--that is, I am not fit                              220
    To lead a band of--patriots: when I lay
    Aside the dignities which I have borne,
    'Tis not to put on others, but to be
    Mate to my fellows--but now to the point:
    Israel has stated to me your whole plan--
    'Tis bold, but feasible if I assist it,
    And must be set in motion instantly.

    _Cal_. E'en when thou wilt. Is it not so, my friends?
    I have disposed all for a sudden blow;
    When shall it be then?

    _Doge_.               At sunrise.

    _Ber_.                            So soon?                         230

    _Doge_. So soon?--so late--each hour accumulates
    Peril on peril, and the more so now
    Since I have mingled with you;--know you not
    The Council, and "the Ten?" the spies, the eyes
    Of the patricians dubious of their slaves,
    And now more dubious of the Prince they have made one?
    I tell you, you must strike, and suddenly,
    Full to the Hydra's heart--its heads will follow.

    _Cal_. With all my soul and sword, I yield assent;
    Our companies are ready, sixty each,                               240
    And all now under arms by Israel's order;
    Each at their different place of rendezvous,
    And vigilant, expectant of some blow;
    Let each repair for action to his post!
    And now, my Lord, the signal?

    _Doge_.                       When you hear
    The great bell of Saint Mark's, which may not be
    Struck without special order of the Doge
    (The last poor privilege they leave their Prince),
    March on Saint Mark's!

    _I. Ber_.              And there?--

    _Doge_.                           By different routes
    Let your march be directed, every sixty                            250
    Entering a separate avenue, and still
    Upon the way let your cry be of War
    And of the Genoese Fleet, by the first dawn
    Discerned before the port; form round the palace,
    Within whose court will be drawn out in arms
    My nephew and the clients of our house,
    Many and martial; while the bell tolls on,
    Shout ye, "Saint Mark!--the foe is on our waters!"

    _Cal_. I see it now--but on, my noble Lord.

    _Doge_. All the patricians flocking to the Council,                260
    (Which they dare not refuse, at the dread signal
    Pealing from out their Patron Saint's proud tower,)
    Will then be gathered in unto the harvest,
    And we will reap them with the sword for sickle.
    If some few should be tardy or absent, them,
    'Twill be but to be taken faint and single,
    When the majority are put to rest.

    _Cal_. Would that the hour were come! we will not scotch,[426]
    But kill.

    _Ber_.     Once more, sir, with your pardon, I
    Would now repeat the question which I asked                        270
    Before Bertuccio added to our cause
    This great ally who renders it more sure,
    And therefore safer, and as such admits
    Some dawn of mercy to a portion of
    Our victims--must all perish in this slaughter?

    _Cal_. All who encounter me and mine--be sure,
    The mercy they have shown, I show.

    _Consp_.                            All! all!
    Is this a time to talk of pity? when
    Have they e'er shown, or felt, or feigned it?

    _I. Ber_.                                    Bertram,
    This false compassion is a folly, and                              280
    Injustice to thy comrades and thy cause!
    Dost thou not see, that if we single out
    Some for escape, they live but to avenge
    The fallen? and how distinguish now the innocent
    From out the guilty? all their acts are one--
    A single emanation from one body,
    Together knit for our oppression! 'Tis
    Much that we let their children live; I doubt
    If all of these even should be set apart:
    The hunter may reserve some single cub                             290
    From out the tiger's litter, but who e'er
    Would seek to save the spotted sire or dam,
    Unless to perish by their fangs? however,
    I will abide by Doge Faliero's counsel:
    Let him decide if any should be saved.

    _Doge_. Ask me not--tempt me not with such a question--
    Decide yourselves.

    _I. Ber_.           You know their private virtues
    Far better than we can, to whom alone
    Their public vices, and most foul oppression,
    Have made them deadly; if there be amongst them                    300
    One who deserves to be repealed, pronounce.

    _Doge_. Dolfino's father was my friend, and Lando
    Fought by my side, and Marc Cornaro shared[dt][427]
    My Genoese embassy: I saved the life[du]
    Of Veniero--shall I save it twice?
    Would that I could save them and Venice also!
    All these men, or their fathers, were my friends
    Till they became my subjects; then fell from me
    As faithless leaves drop from the o'erblown flower,
    And left me a lone blighted thorny stalk,                          310
    Which, in its solitude, can shelter nothing;
    So, as they let me wither, let them perish!

    _Cal_. They cannot co-exist with Venice' freedom!

    _Doge_. Ye, though you know and feel our mutual mass
    Of many wrongs, even ye are ignorant[dv]
    What fatal poison to the springs of Life,
    To human ties, and all that's good and dear,
    Lurks in the present institutes of Venice:
    All these men were my friends; I loved them, they
    Requited honourably my regards;                                    320
    We served and fought; we smiled and wept in concert;
    We revelled or we sorrowed side by side;
    We made alliances of blood and marriage;
    We grew in years and honours fairly,--till
    Their own desire, not my ambition, made
    Them choose me for their Prince, and then farewell!
    Farewell all social memory! all thoughts
    In common! and sweet bonds which link old friendships,
    When the survivors of long years and actions,
    Which now belong to history, soothe the days                       330
    Which yet remain by treasuring each other,
    And never meet, but each beholds the mirror
    Of half a century on his brother's brow,
    And sees a hundred beings, now in earth,
    Flit round them whispering of the days gone by,
    And seeming not all dead, as long as two
    Of the brave, joyous, reckless, glorious band,
    Which once were one and many, still retain
    A breath to sigh for them, a tongue to speak
    Of deeds that else were silent, save on marble----                 340
    _Oimé Oimé!_[428]--and must I do this deed?

    _I. Ber_. My Lord, you are much moved: it is not now
    That such things must be dwelt upon.

    _Doge_.                              Your patience
    A moment--I recede not: mark with me
    The gloomy vices of this government.
    From the hour they made me Doge, the _Doge_ they _made_ me--
    Farewell the past! I died to all that had been,
    Or rather they to me: no friends, no kindness,
    No privacy of life--all were cut off:
    They came not near me--such approach gave umbrage;                 350
    They could not love me--such was not the law;
    They thwarted me--'twas the state's policy;
    They baffled me--'twas a patrician's duty;
    They wronged me, for such was to right the state;
    They could not right me--that would give suspicion;
    So that I was a slave to my own subjects;
    So that I was a foe to my own friends;
    Begirt with spies for guards, with robes for power,
    With pomp for freedom, gaolers for a council,
    Inquisitors for friends, and Hell for life!                        360
    I had only one fount of quiet left,
    And _that_ they poisoned! My pure household gods[429]
    Were shivered on my hearth, and o'er their shrine
    Sate grinning Ribaldry, and sneering Scorn.[dw]

    _I. Ber_. You have been deeply wronged, and now shall be
    Nobly avenged before another night.

    _Doge_. I had borne all--it hurt me, but I bore it--
    Till this last running over of the cup
    Of bitterness--until this last loud insult,
    Not only unredressed, but sanctioned; then,                        370
    And thus, I cast all further feelings from me--
    The feelings which they crushed for me, long, long[dx]
    Before, even in their oath of false allegiance!
    Even in that very hour and vow, they abjured
    Their friend and made a Sovereign, as boys make
    _Playthings_, to do their pleasure--and be broken![dy]
    I from that hour have seen but Senators
    In dark suspicious conflict with the Doge,
    Brooding with him in mutual hate and fear;
    They dreading he should snatch the tyranny                         380
    From out their grasp, and he abhorring tyrants.
    To me, then, these men have no _private_ life,
    Nor claim to ties they have cut off from others;
    As Senators for arbitrary acts
    Amenable, I look on them--as such
    Let them be dealt upon.

    _Cal_.                  And now to action!
    Hence, brethren, to our posts, and may this be
    The last night of mere words: I'd fain be doing!
    Saint Mark's great bell at dawn shall find me wakeful!

    _I. Ber_. Disperse then to your posts: be firm and vigilant;       390
    Think on the wrongs we bear, the rights we claim.
    This day and night shall be the last of peril!
    Watch for the signal, and then march. I go
    To join my band; let each be prompt to marshal
    His separate charge: the Doge will now return
    To the palace to prepare all for the blow.
    We part to meet in Freedom and in Glory!

    _Cal_. Doge, when I greet you next, my homage to you
    Shall be the head of Steno on this sword!

    _Doge_. No; let him be reserved unto the last,                     400
    Nor turn aside to strike at such a prey,[dz]
    Till nobler game is quarried: his offence
    Was a mere ebullition of the vice,
    The general corruption generated
    By the foul Aristocracy: he could not--
    He dared not in more honourable days
    Have risked it. I have merged all private wrath
    Against him in the thought of our great purpose.
    A slave insults me--I require his punishment
    From his proud master's hands; if he refuse it,                    410
    The offence grows his, and let him answer it.

    _Cal_. Yet, as the immediate cause of the alliance
    Which consecrates our undertaking more,
    I owe him such deep gratitude, that fain
    I would repay him as he merits; may I?

    _Doge_. You would but lop the hand, and I the head;
    You would but smite the scholar, I the master;
    You would but punish Steno, I the Senate.
    I cannot pause on individual hate,
    In the absorbing, sweeping, whole revenge,                         420
    Which, like the sheeted fire from Heaven, must blast
    Without distinction, as it fell of yore,
    Where the Dead Sea hath quenched two Cities' ashes.

    _I. Ber_. Away, then, to your posts! I but remain
    A moment to accompany the Doge
    To our late place of tryst, to see no spies
    Have been upon the scout, and thence I hasten
    To where my allotted band is under arms.

    _Cal_. Farewell, then,--until dawn!

    _I. Ber_.                           Success go with you!

    _Consp_. We will not fail--Away! My Lord, farewell!                430

               [_The Conspirators salute the_ DOGE _and_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO,
                _and retire, headed by_ PHILIP CALENDARO. _The_ DOGE _and_
                                                ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _remain_.

    _I. Ber_. We have them in the toil--it cannot fail!
    Now thou'rt indeed a Sovereign, and wilt make
    A name immortal greater than the greatest:
    Free citizens have struck at Kings ere now;
    Cæsars have fallen, and even patrician hands
    Have crushed dictators, as the popular steel
    Has reached patricians: but, until this hour,
    What Prince has plotted for his people's freedom?
    Or risked a life to liberate his subjects?
    For ever, and for ever, they conspire                              440
    Against the people, to abuse their hands
    To chains, but laid aside to carry weapons
    Against the fellow nations, so that yoke
    On yoke, and slavery and death may whet,
    _Not glut_, the never-gorged Leviathan!
    Now, my Lord, to our enterprise;--'tis great,
    And greater the reward; why stand you rapt?
    A moment back, and you were all impatience!

    _Doge_. And is it then decided! must they die?

    _I. Ber_. Who?

    _Doge_.        My own friends by blood and courtesy,               450
    And many deeds and days--the Senators?

    _I. Ber_. You passed their sentence, and it is a just one.

    _Doge_. Aye, so it seems, and so it is to _you_;
    You are a patriot, a plebeian Gracchus--[ea]
    The rebel's oracle, the people's tribune--
    I blame you not--you act in your vocation;[430]
    They smote you, and oppressed you, and despised you;
    So they have _me_: but _you_ ne'er spake with them;
    You never broke their bread, nor shared their salt;
    You never had their wine-cup at your lips:                         460
    You grew not up with them, nor laughed, nor wept,
    Nor held a revel in their company;
    Ne'er smiled to see them smile, nor claimed their smile
    In social interchange for yours, nor trusted
    Nor wore them in your heart of hearts, as I have:
    These hairs of mine are grey, and so are theirs,
    The elders of the Council: I remember
    When all our locks were like the raven's wing,
    As we went forth to take our prey around
    The isles wrung from the false Mahometan;                          470
    And can I see them dabbled o'er with blood?
    Each stab to them will seem my suicide.

    _I. Ber_. Doge! Doge! this vacillation is unworthy
    A child; if you are not in second childhood,
    Call back your nerves to your own purpose, nor
    Thus shame yourself and me. By Heavens! I'd rather
    Forego even now, or fail in our intent,
    Than see the man I venerate subside
    From high resolves into such shallow weakness!
    You have seen blood in battle, shed it, both                       480
    Your own and that of others; can you shrink then
    From a few drops from veins of hoary vampires,
    Who but give back what they have drained from millions?

    _Doge_. Bear with me! Step by step, and blow on blow,
    I will divide with you; think not I waver:
    Ah! no; it is the _certainty_ of all
    Which I must do doth make me tremble thus.
    But let these last and lingering thoughts have way,
    To which you only and the night are conscious,
    And both regardless; when the Hour arrives,                        490
    'Tis mine to sound the knell, and strike the blow,
    Which shall unpeople many palaces,
    And hew the highest genealogic trees
    Down to the earth, strewed with their bleeding fruit,
    And crush their blossoms into barrenness:
    _This will_ I--must I--have I sworn to do,
    Nor aught can turn me from my destiny;
    But still I quiver to behold what I
    Must be, and think what I have been! Bear with me.

    _I. Ber_. Re-man your breast; I feel no such remorse,              500
    I understand it not: why should you change?
    You acted, and you act, on your free will.

    _Doge_. Aye, there it is--_you_ feel not, nor do I,
    Else I should stab thee on the spot, to save
    A thousand lives--and killing, do no murder;
    You _feel_ not--you go to this butcher-work
    As if these high-born men were steers for shambles:
    When all is over, you'll be free and merry,
    And calmly wash those hands incarnadine;
    But I, outgoing thee and all thy fellows                           510
    In this surpassing massacre, shall be,
    Shall see and feel--oh God! oh God! 'tis true,
    And thou dost well to answer that it was
    "My own free will and act," and yet you err,
    For I will do this! Doubt not--fear not; I
    Will be your most unmerciful accomplice!
    And yet I act no more on my free will,
    Nor my own feelings--both compel me back;
    But there is _Hell_ within me and around,
    And like the Demon who believes and trembles                       520
    Must I abhor and do. Away! away!
    Get thee unto thy fellows, I will hie me
    To gather the retainers of our house.
    Doubt not, St. Mark's great bell shall wake all Venice,
    Except her slaughtered Senate: ere the Sun
    Be broad upon the Adriatic there
    Shall be a voice of weeping, which shall drown
    The roar of waters in the cry of blood!
    I am resolved--come on.

    _I. Ber_.                 With all my soul!
    Keep a firm rein upon these bursts of passion;                     530
    Remember what these men have dealt to thee,
    And that this sacrifice will be succeeded
    By ages of prosperity and freedom
    To this unshackled city: a true tyrant[eb]
    Would have depopulated empires, nor
    Have felt the strange compunction which hath wrung you
    To punish a few traitors to the people.
    Trust me, such were a pity more misplaced
    Than the late mercy of the state to Steno.

    _Doge_. Man, thou hast struck upon the chord which jars            540
    All nature from my heart. Hence to our task!
                                                                [_Exeunt_.




                                 ACT IV.


      SCENE I.--_Palazzo of the Patrician_ LIONI.[431] LIONI _laying
        aside the mask and cloak which the Venetian Nobles wore in
                     public, attended by a Domestic_.

    _Lioni_. I will to rest, right weary of this revel,
    The gayest we have held for many moons,
    And yet--I know not why--it cheered me not;
    There came a heaviness across my heart,
    Which, in the lightest movement of the dance,
    Though eye to eye, and hand in hand united
    Even with the Lady of my Love, oppressed me,
    And through my spirit chilled my blood, until
    A damp like Death rose o'er my brow; I strove
    To laugh the thought away, but 'twould not be;                      10
    Through all the music ringing in my ears[ec]
    A knell was sounding as distinct and clear,
    Though low and far, as e'er the Adrian wave
    Rose o'er the City's murmur in the night,
    Dashing against the outward Lido's bulwark:
    So that I left the festival before
    It reached its zenith, and will woo my pillow
    For thoughts more tranquil, or forgetfulness.
    Antonio, take my mask and cloak, and light
    The lamp within my chamber.

    _Ant_.                       Yes, my Lord:                          20
    Command you no refreshment?

    _Lioni_.                      Nought, save sleep,
    Which will not be commanded. Let me hope it,
                                                          [_Exit_ ANTONIO.
    Though my breast feels too anxious; I will try
    Whether the air will calm my spirits: 'tis
    A goodly night; the cloudy wind which blew
    From the Levant hath crept into its cave,
    And the broad Moon hath brightened. What a stillness!
                                               [_Goes to an open lattice_.
    And what a contrast with the scene I left,
    Where the tall torches' glare, and silver lamps'
    More pallid gleam along the tapestried walls,                       30
    Spread over the reluctant gloom which haunts
    Those vast and dimly-latticed galleries
    A dazzling mass of artificial light,
    Which showed all things, but nothing as they were.
    There Age essaying to recall the past,
    After long striving for the hues of Youth
    At the sad labour of the toilet, and
    Full many a glance at the too faithful mirror,
    Pranked forth in all the pride of ornament,
    Forgot itself, and trusting to the falsehood                        40
    Of the indulgent beams, which show, yet hide,
    Believed itself forgotten, and was fooled.
    There Youth, which needed not, nor thought of such
    Vain adjuncts, lavished its true bloom, and health,
    And bridal beauty, in the unwholesome press
    Of flushed and crowded wassailers, and wasted
    Its hours of rest in dreaming this was pleasure,
    And so shall waste them till the sunrise streams
    On sallow cheeks and sunken eyes, which should not
    Have worn this aspect yet for many a year.[432]                     50
    The music, and the banquet, and the wine,
    The garlands, the rose odours, and the flowers,
    The sparkling eyes, and flashing ornaments,
    The white arms and the raven hair, the braids
    And bracelets; swanlike bosoms, and the necklace,
    An India in itself, yet dazzling not
    The eye like what it circled; the thin robes,
    Floating like light clouds 'twixt our gaze and heaven;
    The many-twinkling feet so small and sylphlike,
    Suggesting the more secret symmetry[ed]                             60
    Of the fair forms which terminate so well--
    All the delusion of the dizzy scene,
    Its false and true enchantments--Art and Nature,
    Which swam before my giddy eyes, that drank
    The sight of beauty as the parched pilgrim's
    On Arab sands the false mirage, which offers
    A lucid lake to his eluded thirst,
    Are gone. Around me are the stars and waters--
    Worlds mirrored in the Ocean, goodlier sight[ee]
    Than torches glared back by a gaudy glass;                          70
    And the great Element, which is to space
    What Ocean is to Earth, spreads its blue depths,
    Softened with the first breathings of the spring;
    The high Moon sails upon her beauteous way,
    Serenely smoothing o'er the lofty walls
    Of those tall piles and sea-girt palaces,[ef]
    Whose porphyry pillars, and whose costly fronts,
    Fraught with the Orient spoil of many marbles,
    Like altars ranged along the broad canal,
    Seem each a trophy of some mighty deed                              80
    Reared up from out the waters, scarce less strangely
    Than those more massy and mysterious giants
    Of architecture, those Titanian fabrics,
    Which point in Egypt's plains to times that have
    No other record. All is gentle: nought
    Stirs rudely; but, congenial with the night,
    Whatever walks is gliding like a spirit.
    The tinklings of some vigilant guitars
    Of sleepless lovers to a wakeful mistress,
    And cautious opening of the casement, showing                       90
    That he is not unheard; while her young hand,
    Fair as the moonlight of which it seems part,
    So delicately white, it trembles in
    The act of opening the forbidden lattice,[433]
    To let in love through music, makes his heart
    Thrill like his lyre-strings at the sight; the dash
    Phosphoric of the oar, or rapid twinkle
    Of the far lights of skimming gondolas,[434]
    And the responsive voices of the choir
    Of boatmen answering back with verse for verse;                    100
    Some dusky shadow checkering the Rialto;
    Some glimmering palace roof, or tapering spire,[eg]
    Are all the sights and sounds which here pervade
    The ocean-born and earth-commanding City--
    How sweet and soothing is this hour of calm!
    I thank thee, Night! for thou hast chased away
    Those horrid bodements which, amidst the throng,
    I could not dissipate: and with the blessing
    Of thy benign and quiet influence,
    Now will I to my couch, although to rest                           110
    Is almost wronging such a night as this,----
                                      [_A knocking is heard from without_.
    Hark! what is that? or who at such a moment?[eh]

                             _Enter_ ANTONIO.

    _Ant_. My Lord, a man without, on urgent business,
    Implores to be admitted.

    _Lioni_.                Is he a stranger?[ei]

    _Ant_. His face is muffled in his cloak, but both
    His voice and gestures seem familiar to me;[ej]
    I craved his name, but this he seemed reluctant
    To trust, save to yourself; most earnestly
    He sues to be permitted to approach you.

    _Lioni_. 'Tis a strange hour, and a suspicious bearing!            120
    And yet there is slight peril: 'tis not in
    Their houses noble men are struck at; still,
    Although I know not that I have a foe
    In Venice, 'twill be wise to use some caution.
    Admit him, and retire; but call up quickly
    Some of thy fellows, who may wait without.--
    Who can this man be?--
                    [_Exit_ ANTONIO, _and returns with_ BERTRAM _muffled_.

    _Ber_.                 My good Lord Lioni,
    I have no time to lose, nor thou,--dismiss
    This menial hence; I would be private with you.

    _Lioni_. It seems the voice of Bertram--Go, Antonio.               130
                                                          [_Exit_ ANTONIO.
    Now, stranger, what would you at such an hour?

    _Ber_. (_discovering himself_).
    A boon, my noble patron; you have granted
    Many to your poor client, Bertram; add
    This one, and make him happy.

    _Lioni_.                     Thou hast known me
    From boyhood, ever ready to assist thee
    In all fair objects of advancement, which
    Beseem one of thy station; I would promise
    Ere thy request was heard, but that the hour,
    Thy bearing, and this strange and hurried mode
    Of suing, gives me to suspect this visit                           140
    Hath some mysterious import--but say on--
    What has occurred, some rash and sudden broil?--
    A cup too much, a scuffle, and a stab?
    Mere things of every day; so that thou hast not
    Spilt noble blood, I guarantee thy safety;
    But then thou must withdraw, for angry friends
    And relatives, in the first burst of vengeance,
    Are things in Venice deadlier than the laws.

    _Ber_. My Lord, I thank you; but----

    _Lioni_.                              But what? You have not
    Raised a rash hand against one of our order?                       150
    If so--withdraw and fly--and own it not;[ek]
    I would not slay--but then I must not save thee!
    He who has shed patrician blood----

    _Ber_.                              I come
    To save patrician blood, and not to shed it!
    And thereunto I must be speedy, for
    Each minute lost may lose a life; since Time
    Has changed his slow scythe for the two-edged sword,
    And is about to take, instead of sand,
    The dust from sepulchres to fill his hour-glass!--
    Go not _thou_ forth to-morrow!

    _Lioni_.                            Wherefore not?--               160
    What means this menace?

    _Ber_.                   Do not seek its meaning,
    But do as I implore thee;--stir not forth,
    Whate'er be stirring; though the roar of crowds--
    The cry of women, and the shrieks of babes--
    The groans of men--the clash of arms--the sound
    Of rolling drum, shrill trump, and hollow bell,
    Peal in one wide alarum l--Go not forth,
    Until the Tocsin's silent, nor even then
    Till I return!

    _Lioni_.        Again, what does this mean?

    _Ber_. Again, I tell thee, ask not; but by all                     170
    Thou holdest dear on earth or Heaven--by all
    The Souls of thy great fathers, and thy hope
    To emulate them, and to leave behind
    Descendants worthy both of them and thee--
    By all thou hast of blessed in hope or memory--
    By all thou hast to fear here or hereafter--
    By all the good deeds thou hast done to me,
    Good I would now repay with greater good,[el]
    Remain within--trust to thy household gods,[em]
    And to my word for safety, if thou dost,                           180
    As I now counsel--but if not, thou art lost!

    _Lioni_. I am indeed already lost in wonder;
    Surely thou ravest! what have _I_ to dread?
    Who are my foes? or if there be such, _why_
    Art _thou_ leagued with them?--_thou!_ or, if so leagued,
    Why comest thou to tell me at this hour,
    And not before?

    _Ber_.          I cannot answer this.
    Wilt thou go forth despite of this true warning?

    _Lioni_. I was not born to shrink from idle threats,
    The cause of which I know not: at the hour                         190
    Of council, be it soon or late, I shall not
    Be found among the absent.

    _Ber_.                      Say not so!
    Once more, art thou determined to go forth?

    _Lioni_. I am. Nor is there aught which shall impede me!

    _Ber_. Then, Heaven have mercy on thy soul!--Farewell!
                                                                 [_Going_.

    _Lioni_. Stay--there is more in this than my own safety
    Which makes me call thee back; we must not part thus:
    Bertram, I have known thee long.

    _Ber_.                          From childhood, Signor,
    You have been my protector: in the days
    Of reckless infancy, when rank forgets,                            200
    Or, rather, is not yet taught to remember
    Its cold prerogative, we played together;
    Our sports, our smiles, our tears, were mingled oft;
    My father was your father's client, I
    His son's scarce less than foster-brother; years
    Saw us together--happy, heart-full hours!
    Oh God! the difference 'twixt those hours and this!

    _Lioni_. Bertram, 'tis thou who hast forgotten them.

    _Ber_. Nor now, nor ever; whatsoe'er betide,
    I would have saved you: when to Manhood's growth                   210
    We sprung, and you, devoted to the state,
    As suits your station, the more humble Bertram
    Was left unto the labours of the humble,
    Still you forsook me not; and if my fortunes
    Have not been towering, 'twas no fault of him
    Who ofttimes rescued and supported me,
    When struggling with the tides of Circumstance,
    Which bear away the weaker: noble blood
    Ne'er mantled in a nobler heart than thine
    Has proved to me, the poor plebeian Bertram.                       220
    Would that thy fellow Senators were like thee!

    _Lioni_. Why, what hast thou to say against the Senate?[en]

    _Ber_. Nothing.

    _Lioni_.        I know that there are angry spirits
    And turbulent mutterers of stifled treason,
    Who lurk in narrow places, and walk out
    Muffled to whisper curses to the night;
    Disbanded soldiers, discontented ruffians,
    And desperate libertines who brawl in taverns;
    _Thou_ herdest not with such: 'tis true, of late
    I have lost sight of thee, but thou wert wont                      230
    To lead a temperate life, and break thy bread
    With honest mates, and bear a cheerful aspect.
    What hath come to thee? in thy hollow eye
    And hueless cheek, and thine unquiet motions,
    Sorrow and Shame and Conscience seem at war
    To waste thee.

    _Ber_.         Rather Shame and Sorrow light
    On the accurséd tyranny which rides[eo]
    The very air in Venice, and makes men
    Madden as in the last hours of the plague
    Which sweeps the soul deliriously from life!                       240

    _Lioni_. Some villains have been tampering with thee, Bertram;
    This is not thy old language, nor own thoughts;
    Some wretch has made thee drunk with disaffection:
    But thou must not be lost so; thou _wert_ good
    And kind, and art not fit for such base acts
    As Vice and Villany would put thee to:
    Confess--confide in me--thou know'st my nature.
    What is it thou and thine are bound to do,
    Which should prevent thy friend, the only son
    Of him who was a friend unto thy father,                           250
    So that our good-will is a heritage
    We should bequeath to our posterity
    Such as ourselves received it, or augmented;
    I say, what is it thou must do, that I
    Should deem thee dangerous, and keep the house
    Like a sick girl?

    _Ber_.           Nay, question me no further:
    I must be gone.----

    _Lioni_.           And I be murdered!--say,
    Was it not thus thou said'st, my gentle Bertram?

    _Ber_. Who talks of murder? what said I of murder?
    Tis false! I did not utter such a word.                            260

    _Lioni_. Thou didst not; but from out thy wolfish eye,
    So changed from what I knew it, there glares forth
    The gladiator. If _my_ life's thine object,
    Take it--I am unarmed,--and then away!
    I would not hold my breath on such a tenure[ep]
    As the capricious mercy of such things
    As thou and those who have set thee to thy task-work.

    _Ber_. Sooner than spill thy blood, I peril mine;
    Sooner than harm a hair of thine, I place
    In jeopardy a thousand heads, and some                             270
    As noble, nay, even nobler than thine own.

    _Lioni_. Aye, is it even so? Excuse me, Bertram;
    I am not worthy to be singled out
    From such exalted hecatombs--who are they
    That _are_ in danger, and that _make_ the danger?

    _Ber_. Venice, and all that she inherits, are
    Divided like a house against itself,
    And so will perish ere to-morrow's twilight!

    _Lioni_. More mysteries, and awful ones! But now,
    Or thou, or I, or both, it may be, are                             280
    Upon the verge of ruin; speak once out,
    And thou art safe and glorious: for 'tis more
    Glorious to save than slay, and slay i' the dark too--
    Fie, Bertram! that was not a craft for thee!
    How would it look to see upon a spear
    The head of him whose heart was open to thee!
    Borne by thy hand before the shuddering people?
    And such may be my doom; for here I swear,
    Whate'er the peril or the penalty
    Of thy denunciation, I go forth,                                   290
    Unless thou dost detail the cause, and show
    The consequence of all which led thee here!

    _Ber_. Is there no way to save thee? minutes fly,
    And thou art lost!--_thou_! my sole benefactor,
    The only being who was constant to me
    Through every change. Yet, make me not a traitor!
    Let me save thee--but spare my honour!

    _Lioni_.                              Where
    Can lie the honour in a league of murder?
    And who are traitors save unto the State?

    _Ber_. A league is still a compact, and more binding               300
    In honest hearts when words must stand for law;
    And in my mind, there is no traitor like
    He whose domestic treason plants the poniard[435]
    Within the breast which trusted to his truth.
    Lioni. And who will strike the steel to mine?

    _Ber_.                                       Not I;
    I could have wound my soul up to all things
    Save this. _Thou_ must not die! and think how dear
    Thy life is, when I risk so many lives,
    Nay, more, the Life of lives, the liberty
    Of future generations, _not_ to be                                 310
    The assassin thou miscall'st me:--once, once more
    I do adjure thee, pass not o'er thy threshold!

    _Lioni_. It is in vain--this moment I go forth.

    _Ber_. Then perish Venice rather than my friend!
    I will disclose--ensnare--betray--destroy--
    Oh, what a villain I become for thee!

    _Lioni_. Say, rather thy friend's saviour and the State's!--
    Speak--pause not--all rewards, all pledges for
    Thy safety and thy welfare; wealth such as
    The State accords her worthiest servants; nay,                     330
    Nobility itself I guarantee thee,
    So that thou art sincere and penitent.

    _Ber_. I have thought again: it must not be--I love thee--
    Thou knowest it--that I stand here is the proof,
    Not least though last; but having done my duty
    By thee, I now must do it by my country!
    Farewell--we meet no more in life!--farewell!

    _Lioni_. What, ho!--Antonio--Pedro--to the door!
    See that none pass--arrest this man!----

     _Enter_ ANTONIO _and other armed Domestics, who seize_ BERTRAM.

    _Lioni_ (_continues_).              Take care
    He hath no harm; bring me my sword and cloak,                      330
    And man the gondola with four oars--quick--
                                                          [_Exit_ ANTONIO.
    We will unto Giovanni Gradenigo's,
    And send for Marc Cornaro:--fear not, Bertram;
    This needful violence is for thy safety,
    No less than for the general weal.

    _Ber_.                            Where wouldst thou
    Bear me a prisoner?

    _Lioni_.             Firstly to "the Ten;"
    Next to the Doge.

    _Ber_.           To the Doge?

    _Lioni_.                           Assuredly:
    Is he not Chief of the State?

    _Ber_.                        Perhaps at sunrise--

    _Lioni_. What mean you?--but we'll know anon.

    _Ber_.                                       Art sure?

    _Lioni_. Sure as all gentle means can make; and if                 340
    They fail, you know "the Ten" and their tribunal,
    And that St. Mark's has dungeons, and the dungeons
    A rack.

    _Ber_.  Apply it then before the dawn
    Now hastening into heaven.--One more such word,
    And you shall perish piecemeal, by the death
    You think to doom to me.

                           _Re-enter_ ANTONIO.

    _Ant_.                    The bark is ready,
    My Lord, and all prepared.

    _Lioni_.                  Look to the prisoner.
    Bertram, I'll reason with thee as we go
    To the Magnifico's, sage Gradenigo.                         [_Exeunt_.


          SCENE II.--_The Ducal Palace_--_The Doge's Apartment_.

              _The_ DOGE _and his Nephew_ BERTUCCIO FALIERO.

    _Doge_. Are all the people of our house in muster?

    _Ber. F._ They are arrayed, and eager for the signal,
    Within our palace precincts at San Polo:[436]
    I come for your last orders.

    _Doge_.                     It had been
    As well had there been time to have got together,
    From my own fief, Val di Marino, more
    Of our retainers--but it is too late.

    _Ber. F._ Methinks, my Lord,'tis better as it is:
    A sudden swelling of our retinue
    Had waked suspicion; and, though fierce and trusty,                 10
    The vassals of that district are too rude
    And quick in quarrel to have long maintained
    The secret discipline we need for such
    A service, till our foes are dealt upon.

    _Doge_. True; but when once the signal has been given,
    _These_ are the men for such an enterprise;
    These city slaves have all their private bias,
    Their prejudice _against_ or _for_ this noble,
    Which may induce them to o'erdo or spare
    Where mercy may be madness; the fierce peasants,                    20
    Serfs of my county of Val di Marino,
    Would do the bidding of their lord without
    Distinguishing for love or hate his foes;
    Alike to them Marcello or Cornaro,
    A Gradenigo or a Foscari;[eq]
    They are not used to start at those vain names,
    Nor bow the knee before a civic Senate;
    A chief in armour is their Suzerain,
    And not a thing in robes.

    _Ber. F._                We are enough;
    And for the dispositions of our clients                             30
    Against the Senate I will answer.

    _Doge_.                          Well,
    The die is thrown; but for a warlike service,
    Done in the field, commend me to my peasants:
    They made the sun shine through the host of Huns
    When sallow burghers slunk back to their tents,
    And cowered to hear their own victorious trumpet.
    If there be small resistance, you will find
    These Citizens all Lions, like their Standard;[437]
    But if there's much to do, you'll wish, with me,
    A band of iron rustics at our backs.                                40

    _Ber_. Thus thinking, I must marvel you resolve
    To strike the blow so suddenly.

    _Doge_.                        Such blows
    Must be struck suddenly or never. When
    I had o'ermastered the weak false remorse
    Which yearned about my heart, too fondly yielding
    A moment to the feelings of old days,
    I was most fain to strike; and, firstly, that
    I might not yield again to such emotions;
    And, secondly, because of all these men,
    Save Israel and Philip Calendaro,                                   50
    I know not well the courage or the faith:
    To-day might find 'mongst them a traitor to us,
    As yesterday a thousand to the Senate;
    But once in, with their hilts hot in their hands,
    They must _on_ for their own sakes; one stroke struck,
    And the mere instinct of the first-born Cain,
    Which ever lurks somewhere in human hearts,
    Though Circumstance may keep it in abeyance,
    Will urge the rest on like to wolves; the sight
    Of blood to crowds begets the thirst of more,                       60
    As the first wine-cup leads to the long revel;
    And you will find a harder task to quell
    Than urge them when they _have_ commenced, but _till_
    That moment, a mere voice, a straw, a shadow,
    Are capable of turning them aside.--
    How goes the night?

    _Ber. F._          Almost upon the dawn.

    _Doge_. Then it is time to strike upon the bell.
    Are the men posted?

    _Ber. F._          By this time they are;
    But they have orders not to strike, until
    They have command from you through me in person.                    70

    _Doge_. 'Tis well.--Will the morn never put to rest
    These stars which twinkle yet o'er all the heavens?
    I am settled and bound up, and being so,
    The very effort which it cost me to
    Resolve to cleanse this Commonwealth with fire,
    Now leaves my mind more steady. I have wept,
    And trembled at the thought of this dread duty;
    But now I have put down all idle passion,
    And look the growing tempest in the face,
    As doth the pilot of an Admiral Galley:[438]                        80
    Yet (wouldst thou think it, kinsman?) it hath been
    A greater struggle to me, than when nations
    Beheld their fate merged in the approaching fight,
    Where I was leader of a phalanx, where
    Thousands were sure to perish--Yes, to spill
    The rank polluted current from the veins
    Of a few bloated despots needed more
    To steel me to a purpose such as made
    Timoleon immortal,[439] than to face
    The toils and dangers of a life of war.                             90

    _Ber. F._ It gladdens me to see your former wisdom
    Subdue the furies which so wrung you ere
    You were decided.

    _Doge_.          It was ever thus
    With me; the hour of agitation came
    In the first glimmerings of a purpose, when
    Passion had too much room to sway; but in
    The hour of action I have stood as calm
    As were the dead who lay around me: this
    They knew who made me what I am, and trusted
    To the subduing power which I preserved                            100
    Over my mood, when its first burst was spent.
    But they were not aware that there are things
    Which make revenge a virtue by reflection,
    And not an impulse of mere anger; though
    The laws sleep, Justice wakes, and injured souls
    Oft do a public right with private wrong,
    And justify their deeds unto themselves.--
    Methinks the day breaks--is it not so? look,
    Thine eyes are clear with youth;--the air puts on
    A morning freshness, and, at least to me,                          110
    The sea looks greyer through the lattice.

    _Ber. F._                                True,
    The morn is dappling in the sky.[er][440]

    _Doge_.                               Away then!
    See that they strike without delay, and with
    The first toll from St. Mark's, march on the palace
    With all our House's strength; here I will meet you;
    The Sixteen and their companies will move
    In separate columns at the self-same moment:
    Be sure you post yourself at the great Gate:
    I would not trust "the Ten" except to us--
    The rest, the rabble of patricians, may                            120
    Glut the more careless swords of those leagued with us.
    Remember that the cry is still "Saint Mark!
    The Genoese are come--ho! to the rescue!
    Saint Mark and Liberty!"--Now--now to action![es]

    _Ber. F._ Farewell then, noble Uncle! we will meet
    In freedom and true sovereignty, or never!

    _Doge_. Come hither, my Bertuccio--one embrace;
    Speed, for the day grows broader; send me soon
    A messenger to tell me how all goes
    When you rejoin our troops, and then sound--sound                  130
    The storm-bell from St. Mark's![et]
                                                [_Exit_ BERTUCCIO FALIERO.

    _Doge_ (_solus_).                 He is gone,
    And on each footstep moves a life. 'Tis done.[441]
    Now the destroying Angel hovers o'er
    Venice, and pauses ere he pours the vial,
    Even as the eagle overlooks his prey,
    And for a moment, poised in middle air,
    Suspends the motion of his mighty wings,
    Then swoops with his unerring beak.[442] Thou Day!
    That slowly walk'st the waters! march--march on--
    I would not smite i' the dark, but rather see                      140
    That no stroke errs. And you, ye blue sea waves!
    I have seen you dyed ere now, and deeply too,
    With Genoese, Saracen, and Hunnish gore,
    While that of Venice flowed too, but victorious:
    Now thou must wear an unmixed crimson; no
    Barbaric blood can reconcile us now
    Unto that horrible incarnadine,
    But friend or foe will roll in civic slaughter.
    And have I lived to fourscore years[443] for this?
    I, who was named Preserver of the City?                            150
    I, at whose name the million's caps were flung[eu]
    Into the air, and cries from tens of thousands
    Rose up, imploring Heaven to send me blessings,
    And fame, and length of days--to see this day?
    But this day, black within the calendar,
    Shall be succeeded by a bright millennium.
    Doge Dandolo survived to ninety summers
    To vanquish empires, and refuse their crown;[444]
    I will resign a crown, and make the State
    Renew its freedom--but oh! by what means?                          160
    The noble end must justify them. What
    Are a few drops of human blood? 'tis false,
    The blood of tyrants is not human; they,
    Like to incarnate Molochs, feed on ours,
    Until 'tis time to give them to the tombs
    Which they have made so populous.--Oh World!
    Oh Men! what are ye, and our best designs,
    That we must work by crime to punish crime?
    And slay as if Death had but this one gate,
    When a few years would make the sword superfluous?                 170
    And I, upon the verge of th' unknown realm,
    Yet send so many heralds on before me?--
    I must not ponder this.                                    [_A pause._
                             Hark! was there not
    A murmur as of distant voices, and
    The tramp of feet in martial unison?
    What phantoms even of sound our wishes raise!
    It cannot be--the signal hath not rung--
    Why pauses it? My nephew's messenger
    Should be upon his way to me, and he
    Himself perhaps even now draws grating back                        180
    Upon its ponderous hinge the steep tower portal,
    Where swings the sullen huge oracular bell,[ev]
    Which never knells but for a princely death,
    Or for a state in peril, pealing forth
    Tremendous bodements; let it do its office,
    And be this peal its awfullest and last
    Sound till the strong tower rock!--What! silent still?
    I would go forth, but that my post is here,
    To be the centre of re-union to
    The oft discordant elements which form                             190
    Leagues of this nature, and to keep compact
    The wavering of the weak, in case of conflict;
    For if they should do battle,'twill be here,
    Within the palace, that the strife will thicken:
    Then here must be my station, as becomes
    The master-mover.--Hark! he comes--he comes,
    My nephew, brave Bertuccio's messenger.--
    What tidings? Is he marching? hath he sped?
    _They_ here!-all's lost-yet will I make an effort.

      _Enter a_ SIGNOR OF THE NIGHT,[445] _with Guards, etc., etc._

    _Sig_. Doge, I arrest thee of high treason!

    _Doge_.                                     Me!                    200
    Thy Prince, of treason?--Who are they that dare
    Cloak their own treason under such an order?

    _Sig_. (_showing his order_).
    Behold my order from the assembled Ten.

    _Doge_. And _where_ are they, and _why_ assembled? no
    Such Council can be lawful, till the Prince
    Preside there, and that duty's mine:[446] on thine
    I charge thee, give me way, or marshal me
    To the Council chamber.

    _Sig_.                 Duke! it may not be:
    Nor are they in the wonted Hall of Council,
    But sitting in the convent of Saint Saviour's.                     210

    _Doge_. You dare to disobey me, then?

    _Sig_.                                I serve
    The State, and needs must serve it faithfully;
    My warrant is the will of those who rule it.

    _Doge_. And till that warrant has my signature
    It is illegal, and, as _now_ applied,
    Rebellious. Hast thou weighed well thy life's worth,
    That thus you dare assume a lawless function?[ew]

    _Sig_. 'Tis not my office to reply, but act--
    I am placed here as guard upon thy person,
    And not as judge to hear or to decide.                             220

    _Doge_ (_aside_).
    I must gain time. So that the storm-bell sound,[ex][447]
    All may be well yet. Kinsman, speed--speed--speed!--
    Our fate is trembling in the balance, and
    Woe to the vanquished! be they Prince and people,
    Or slaves and Senate--
                                    [_The great bell of St. Mark's tolls._
                          Lo! it sounds--it tolls!

    _Doge_ (_aloud_).
    Hark, Signor of the Night! and you, ye hirelings,
    Who wield your mercenary staves in fear,
    It is your knell.--Swell on, thou lusty peal!
    Now, knaves, what ransom for your lives?

    _Sig_.                                  Confusion!
    Stand to your arms, and guard the door--all's lost                 230
    Unless that fearful bell be silenced soon.
    The officer hath missed his path or purpose,
    Or met some unforeseen and hideous obstacle,[ey]
    Anselmo, with thy company proceed
    Straight to the tower; the rest remain with me.
                                                [_Exit part of the Guard._

    _Doge_. Wretch! if thou wouldst have thy vile life, implore it;
    It is not now a lease of sixty seconds.
    Aye, send thy miserable ruffians forth;
    They never shall return.

    _Sig_.                     So let it be!
    They die then in their duty, as will I.                            240

    _Doge_. Fool! the high eagle flies at nobler game
    Than thou and thy base myrmidons,--live on,
    So thou provok'st not peril by resistance,
    And learn (if souls so much obscured can bear
    To gaze upon the sunbeams) to be free.

    _Sig_.  And learn thou to be captive. It hath ceased,
                                               [_The bell ceases to toll_.
    The traitorous signal, which was to have set
    The bloodhound mob on their patrician prey--
    The knell hath rung, but it is not the Senate's!

    _Doge_ (_after a pause_).
    All's silent, and all's lost!

    _Sig_.                       Now, Doge, denounce me                250
    As rebel slave of a revolted Council!
    Have I not done my duty?

    _Doge_.                  Peace, thou thing!
    Thou hast done a worthy deed, and earned the price
    Of blood, and they who use thee will reward thee.
    But thou wert sent to watch, and not to prate,
    As thou said'st even now--then do thine office,
    But let it be in silence, as behoves thee,
    Since, though thy prisoner, I am thy Prince.

    _Sig_. I did not mean to fail in the respect
    Due to your rank: in this I shall obey you.                        260

    _Doge_ (_aside_). There now is nothing left me save to die;
    And yet how near success! I would have fallen,
    And proudly, in the hour of triumph, but
    To miss it thus!----

                _Enter other_ SIGNORS OF THE NIGHT, _with_
                      BERTUCCIO FALIERO _prisoner_.

    _2nd Sig_.             We took him in the act
    Of issuing from the tower, where, at his order,
    As delegated from the Doge, the signal
    Had thus begun to sound.

    _1st Sig_.                Are all the passes
    Which lead up to the palace well secured?

    _2nd Sig_. They are--besides, it matters not; the Chiefs
    Are all in chains, and some even now on trial--                    270
    Their followers are dispersed, and many taken.

    _Ber. F._ Uncle!

    _Doge_.           It is in vain to war with Fortune;
    The glory hath departed from our house.

    _Ber. F._ Who would have deemed it?--Ah! one moment sooner!

    _Doge_. That moment would have changed the face of ages;
    _This_ gives us to Eternity--We'll meet it
    As men whose triumph is not in success,
    But who can make their own minds all in all,
    Equal to every fortune. Droop not,'tis
    But a brief passage--I would go alone,                             280
    Yet if they send us, as 'tis like, together,
    Let us go worthy of our sires and selves.

    _Ber. F._ I shall not shame you, Uncle.

    _1st Sig_.                             Lords, our orders
    Are to keep guard on both in separate chambers,
    Until the Council call ye to your trial.

    _Doge_. Our trial! will they keep their mockery up
    Even to the last? but let them deal upon us,
    As we had dealt on them, but with less pomp.
    'Tis but a game of mutual homicides,
    Who have cast lots for the first death, and they                   290
    Have won with false dice.--Who hath been our Judas?

    _1st Sig_. I am not warranted to answer that.

    _Ber. F._ I'll answer for thee--'tis a certain Bertram,
    Even now deposing to the secret Giunta.

    _Doge_. Bertram, the Bergamask! With what vile tools[448]
    We operate to slay or save! This creature,
    Black with a double treason, now will earn
    Rewards and honours, and be stamped in story
    With the geese in the Capitol, which gabbled
    Till Rome awoke, and had an annual triumph,                        300
    While Manlius, who hurled down the Gauls, was cast[ez]
    From the Tarpeian.

    _1st Sig_.          He aspired to treason,
    And sought to rule the State.

    _Doge_.                       He saved the State,
    And sought but to reform what he revived--
    But this is idle--Come, sirs, do your work.

    _1st Sig_. Noble Bertuccio, we must now remove you
    Into an inner chamber.

    _Ber. F._               Farewell, Uncle!
    If we shall meet again in life I know not,
    But they perhaps will let our ashes mingle.

    _Doge_. Yes, and our spirits, which shall yet go forth,            310
    And do what our frail clay, thus clogged, hath failed in!
    They cannot quench the memory of those
    Who would have hurled them from their guilty thrones,
    And such examples will find heirs, though distant.




                                  ACT V.


 SCENE 1.--_The Hall of the Council of Ten assembled with the additional
   Senators, who, on the Trials of the Conspirators for the Treason of_
 MARINO FALIERO, _composed what was called the Giunta,--Guards, Officers,
   etc., etc._ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _and_ PHILIP CALENDARO _as Prisoners_.
                  BERTRAM, LIONI, _and Witnesses, etc._

               _The Chief of the Ten_, BENINTENDE.[fa][449]

    _Ben_. There now rests, after such conviction of
    Their manifold and manifest offences,
    But to pronounce on these obdurate men
    The sentence of the Law:--a grievous task
    To those who hear, and those who speak. Alas!
    That it should fall to me! and that my days
    Of office should be stigmatised through all
    The years of coming time, as bearing record
    To this most foul and complicated treason
    Against a just and free state, known to all                         10
    The earth as being the Christian bulwark 'gainst
    The Saracen and the schismatic Greek,
    The savage Hun, and not less barbarous Frank;
    A City which has opened India's wealth
    To Europe; the last Roman refuge from
    O'erwhelming Attila; the Ocean's Queen;
    Proud Genoa's prouder rival! 'Tis to sap
    The throne of such a City, these lost men
    Have risked and forfeited their worthless lives--
    So let them die the death.

    _I. Ber_.                  We are prepared;                         20
    Your racks have done that for us. Let us die.

    _Ben_. If ye have that to say which would obtain
    Abatement of your punishment, the Giunta
    Will hear you; if you have aught to confess,
    Now is your time,--perhaps it may avail ye.

    _I. Ber_. We stand to hear, and not to speak.

    _Ben_.                                       Your crimes
    Are fully proved by your accomplices,
    And all which Circumstance can add to aid them;
    Yet we would hear from your own lips complete
    Avowal of your treason: on the verge                                30
    Of that dread gulf which none repass, the truth
    Alone can profit you on earth or Heaven--
    Say, then, what was your motive?

    _I. Ber_.                         Justice![fb]

    _Ben_.                                      What
    Your object?

    _I. Ber_.   Freedom!

    _Ben_.              You are brief, sir.

    _I. Ber_. So my life grows: I
    Was bred a soldier, not a senator.

    _Ben_. Perhaps you think by this blunt brevity
    To brave your judges to postpone the sentence?

    _I. Ber_. Do you be brief as I am, and believe me,
    I shall prefer that mercy to your pardon.                           40

    _Ben_. Is this your sole reply to the Tribunal?

    _I. Ber_. Go, ask your racks what they have wrung from us,
    Or place us there again; we have still some blood left,
    And some slight sense of pain in these wrenched limbs:
    But this ye dare not do; for if we die there--
    And you have left us little life to spend
    Upon your engines, gorged with pangs already--
    Ye lose the public spectacle, with which
    You would appal your slaves to further slavery!
    Groans are not words, nor agony assent,                             50
    Nor affirmation Truth, if Nature's sense
    Should overcome the soul into a lie,
    For a short respite--must we bear or die?

    _Ben_. Say, who were your accomplices?

    _I. Ber_.                              The Senate.

    _Ben_. What do you mean?

    _I. Ber_.                 Ask of the suffering people,
    Whom your patrician crimes have driven to crime.

    _Ben_. You know the Doge?

    _I. Ber_.                  I served with him at Zara
    In the field, when _you_ were pleading here your way
    To present office; we exposed our lives,
    While you but hazarded the lives of others,                         60
    Alike by accusation or defence;
    And for the rest, all Venice knows her Doge,
    Through his great actions, and the Senate's insults.

    _Ben_. You have held conference with him?

    _I. Ber_.                                I am weary--
    Even wearier of your questions than your tortures:
    I pray you pass to judgment.

    _Ben_.                         It is coming.
    And you, too, Philip Calendaro, what
    Have you to say why you should not be doomed?

    _Cal_. I never was a man of many words,
    And now have few left worth the utterance.                          70

    _Ben_. A further application of yon engine
    May change your tone.

    _Cal_.                 Most true, it _will_ do so;
    A former application did so; but
    It will not change my words, or, if it did--

    _Ben_. What then?

    _Cal_.             Will my avowal on yon rack
    Stand good in law?

    _Ben_.             Assuredly.

    _Cal_.                          Whoe'er
    The culprit be whom I accuse of treason?

    _Ben_. Without doubt, he will be brought up to trial.

    _Cal_. And on this testimony would he perish?

    _Ben_. So your confession be detailed and full,                     80
    He will stand here in peril of his life.

    _Cal_. Then look well to thy proud self, President!
    For by the Eternity which yawns before me,
    I swear that _thou_, and only thou, shall be
    The traitor I denounce upon that rack,
    If I be stretched there for the second time.

    _One of the Giunta_. Lord President,'twere best proceed to judgment;
    There is no more to be drawn from these men.[fc]

    _Ben_. Unhappy men! prepare for instant death.
    The nature of your crime--our law--and peril                        90
    The State now stands in, leave not an hour's respite.
    Guards! lead them forth, and upon the balcony
    Of the red columns, where, on festal Thursday,[450]
    The Doge stands to behold the chase of bulls,
    Let them be justified: and leave exposed
    Their wavering relics, in the place of judgment,
    To the full view of the assembled people!
    And Heaven have mercy on their souls!

    _The Giunta_.                           Amen!

    _I. Ber_. Signors, farewell! we shall not all again
    Meet in one place.

    _Ben_.            And lest they should essay                       100
    To stir up the distracted multitude--
    Guards! let their mouths be gagged[451] even in the act
    Of execution. Lead them hence!

    _Cal_.                        What! must we
    Not even say farewell to some fond friend,
    Nor leave a last word with our confessor?

    _Ben_. A priest is waiting in the antechamber;
    But, for your friends, such interviews would be
    Painful to them, and useless all to you.

    _Cal_. I knew that we were gagged in life; at least
    All those who had not heart to risk their lives                    110
    Upon their open thoughts; but still I deemed
    That in the last few moments, the same idle
    Freedom of speech accorded to the dying,
    Would not now be denied to us; but since----

    _I. Ber_. Even let them have their way, brave Calendaro!
    What matter a few syllables? let's die
    Without the slightest show of favour from them;
    So shall our blood more readily arise
    To Heaven against them, and more testify
    To their atrocities, than could a volume                           120
    Spoken or written of our dying words!
    They tremble at our voices--nay, they dread
    Our very silence--let them live in fear!
    Leave them unto their thoughts, and let us now
    Address our own above!--Lead on; we are ready.

    _Cal_. Israel, hadst thou but hearkened unto me
    It had not now been thus; and yon pale villain,
    The coward Bertram, would----

    _I. Ber_.                      Peace, Calendaro!
    What brooks it now to ponder upon this?

    _Bert_. Alas! I fain you died in peace with me:                    130
    I did not seek this task; 'twas forced upon me:
    Say, you forgive me, though I never can
    Retrieve my own forgiveness--frown not thus!

    _I. Ber_. I die and pardon thee!

    _Cal_. (_spitting at him_).[452] I die and scorn thee!
         [_Exeunt_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _and_ PHILIP CALENDARO, _Guards, etc_.

    _Ben_. Now that these criminals have been disposed of,
    'Tis time that we proceed to pass our sentence
    Upon the greatest traitor upon record
    In any annals, the Doge Faliero!
    The proofs and process are complete; the time
    And crime require a quick procedure: shall                         140
    He now be called in to receive the award?

    _The Giunta_. Aye, aye.

    _Ben_.                   Avogadori, order that the Doge
    Be brought before the Council.

    _One of the Giunta_.            And the rest,
    When shall they be brought up?

    _Ben_.                          When all the Chiefs
    Have been disposed of. Some have fled to Chiozza;
    But there are thousands in pursuit of them,
    And such precaution ta'en on terra firma,
    As well as in the islands, that we hope
    None will escape to utter in strange lands
    His libellous tale of treasons 'gainst the Senate.                 150

         _Enter the_ DOGE _as Prisoner, with Guards, etc., etc._

    _Ben_. Doge--for such still you are, and by the law
    Must be considered, till the hour shall come
    When you must doff the Ducal Bonnet from
    That head, which could not wear a crown more noble
    Than Empires can confer, in quiet honour,
    But it must plot to overthrow your peers,
    Who made you what you are, and quench in blood
    A City's glory--we have laid already
    Before you in your chamber at full length,
    By the Avogadori, all the proofs                                   160
    Which have appeared against you; and more ample
    Ne'er reared their sanguinary shadows to
    Confront a traitor. What have you to say
    In your defence?

    _Doge_.            What shall I say to ye,
    Since my defence must be your condemnation?
    You are at once offenders and accusers,
    Judges and Executioners!--Proceed
    Upon your power.

    _Ben_.             Your chief accomplices
    Having confessed, there is no hope for you.

    _Doge_. And who be they?

    _Ben_.                    In number many; but                      170
    The first now stands before you in the court,
    Bertram of Bergamo,--would you question him?

    _Doge_ (_looking at him contemptuously_).        No.

    _Ben_. And two others, Israel Bertuccio,
    And Philip Calendaro, have admitted
    Their fellowship in treason with the Doge!

    _Doge_. And where are they?

    _Ben_.                    Gone to their place, and now
    Answering to Heaven for what they did on earth.

    _Doge_. Ah! the plebeian Brutus, is he gone?
    And the quick Cassius of the arsenal?--
    How did they meet their doom?

    _Ben_.                        Think of your own:                   180
    It is approaching. You decline to plead, then?[fd]

    _Doge_. I cannot plead to my inferiors, nor
    Can recognise your legal power to try me.
    Show me the law!

    _Ben_.           On great emergencies,
    The law must be remodelled or amended:
    Our fathers had not fixed the punishment
    Of such a crime, as on the old Roman tables
    The sentence against parricide was left
    In pure forgetfulness; they could not render
    That penal, which had neither name nor thought                     190
    In their great bosoms; who would have foreseen
    That Nature could be filed to such a crime[453]
    As sons 'gainst sires, and princes 'gainst their realms?
    Your sin hath made us make a law which will
    Become a precedent 'gainst such haught traitors,
    As would with treason mount to tyranny;
    Not even contented with a sceptre, till
    They can convert it to a two-edged sword!
    Was not the place of Doge sufficient for ye?
    What's nobler than the signory[454] of Venice?                     200

    _Doge_. The signory of Venice! You betrayed me--
    _You--you_, who sit there, traitors as ye are!
    From my equality with you in birth,
    And my superiority in action,
    You drew me from my honourable toils
    In distant lands--on flood, in field, in cities--
    _You_ singled me out like a victim to
    Stand crowned, but bound and helpless, at the altar
    Where you alone could minister. I knew not,
    I sought not, wished not, dreamed not the election,                210
    Which reached me first at Rome, and I obeyed;
    But found on my arrival, that, besides
    The jealous vigilance which always led you
    To mock and mar your Sovereign's best intents,
    You had, even in the interregnum[455] of
    My journey to the capital, curtailed
    And mutilated the few privileges
    Yet left the Duke: all this I bore, and would
    Have borne, until my very hearth was stained
    By the pollution of your ribaldry,                                 220
    And he, the ribald, whom I see amongst you--
    Fit judge in such tribunal!----

    _Ben_. (_interrupting him_).        Michel Steno
    Is here in virtue of his office, as
    One of the Forty; "the Ten" having craved
    A Giunta of patricians from the Senate
    To aid our judgment in a trial arduous
    And novel as the present: he was set
    Free from the penalty pronounced upon him,
    Because the Doge, who should protect the law,
    Seeking to abrogate all law, can claim                             230
    No punishment of others by the statutes
    Which he himself denies and violates!

    _Doge_. _His_ punishment! I rather see him _there_,
    Where he now sits, to glut him with my death,
    Than in the mockery of castigation,
    Which your foul, outward, juggling show of justice
    Decreed as sentence! Base as was his crime,
    'Twas purity compared with your protection.

    _Ben_. And can it be, that the great Doge of Venice,
    With three parts of a century of years                             240
    And honours on his head, could thus allow
    His fury, like an angry boy's, to master
    All Feeling, Wisdom, Faith and Fear, on such
    A provocation as a young man's petulance?

    _Doge_. A spark creates the flame--'tis the last drop
    Which makes the cup run o'er, and mine was full
    Already: you oppressed the Prince and people;
    I would have freed both, and have failed in both:
    The price of such success would have been glory,
    Vengeance, and victory, and such a name                            250
    As would have made Venetian history
    Rival to that of Greece and Syracuse
    When they were freed, and flourished ages after,
    And mine to Gelon and to Thrasybulus:[456]
    Failing, I know the penalty of failure
    Is present infamy and death--the future
    Will judge, when Venice is no more, or free;
    Till then, the truth is in abeyance. Pause not;
    I would have shown no mercy, and I seek none;
    My life was staked upon a mighty hazard,                           260
    And being lost, take what I would have taken!
    I would have stood alone amidst your tombs:
    Now you may flock round mine, and trample on it,
    As you have done upon my heart while living.[457]

    _Ben_. You do confess then, and admit the justice
    Of our Tribunal?

    _Doge_.            I confess to have failed;
    Fortune is female: from my youth her favours
    Were not withheld, the fault was mine to hope
    Her former smiles again at this late hour.

    _Ben_. You do not then in aught arraign our equity?                270

    _Doge_. Noble Venetians! stir me not with questions.
    I am resigned to the worst; but in me still
    Have something of the blood of brighter days,
    And am not over-patient. Pray you, spare me
    Further interrogation, which boots nothing,
    Except to turn a trial to debate.
    I shall but answer that which will offend you,
    And please your enemies--a host already;
    'Tis true, these sullen walls should yield no echo:
    But walls have ears--nay, more, they have tongues; and if          280
    There were no other way for Truth to o'erleap them,[fe]
    You who condemn me, you who fear and slay me,
    Yet could not bear in silence to your graves
    What you would hear from me of Good or Evil;
    The secret were too mighty for your souls:
    Then let it sleep in mine, unless you court
    A danger which would double that you escape.
    Such my defence would be, had I full scope
    To make it famous; for true _words_ are _things_,
    And dying men's are things which long outlive,                     290
    And oftentimes avenge them; bury mine,
    If ye would fain survive me: take this counsel,
    And though too oft ye make me live in wrath,
    Let me die calmly; you may grant me this;
    I deny nothing--defend nothing--nothing
    I ask of you, but silence for myself,
    And sentence from the Court!

    _Ben_.                        This full admission
    Spares us the harsh necessity of ordering
    The torture to elicit the whole truth.[ff]

    _Doge_. The torture! you have put me there already,                300
    Daily since I was Doge; but if you will
    Add the corporeal rack, you may: these limbs
    Will yield with age to crushing iron; but
    There's that within my heart shall strain your engines.

                           _Enter an_ OFFICER.

    _Officer_. Noble Venetians! Duchess Faliero[fg]
    Requests admission to the Giunta's presence.

    _Ben_. Say, Conscript Fathers,[458] shall she be admitted?

    _One of the Giunta_.  She may have revelations of importance
    Unto the state, to justify compliance
    With her request.

    _Ben_.              Is this the general will?                      310

    _All_. It is.

    _Doge_.         Oh, admirable laws of Venice!
    Which would admit the wife, in the full hope
    That she might testify against the husband.
    What glory to the chaste Venetian dames!
    But such blasphemers 'gainst all Honour, as
    Sit here, do well to act in their vocation.
    Now, villain Steno! if this woman fail,
    I'll pardon thee thy lie, and thy escape,
    And my own violent death, and thy vile life.

                         _The_ DUCHESS _enters_.

    _Ben_. Lady! this just Tribunal has resolved,                      320
    Though the request be strange, to grant it, and
    Whatever be its purport, to accord
    A patient hearing with the due respect
    Which fits your ancestry, your rank, and virtues:
    But you turn pale--ho! there, look to the Lady!
    Place a chair instantly.

    _Ang_.                   A moment's faintness--
    'Tis past; I pray you pardon me,--I sit not
    In presence of my Prince and of my husband,
    While he is on his feet.

    _Ben_.                    Your pleasure, Lady?

    _Ang_. Strange rumours, but most true, if all I hear               330
    And see be sooth, have reached me, and I come
    To know the worst, even at the worst; forgive
    The abruptness of my entrance and my bearing.
    Is it--I cannot speak--I cannot shape
    The question--but you answer it ere spoken,
    With eyes averted, and with gloomy brows--
    Oh God! this is the silence of the grave!

    _Ben_. (_after a pause_). Spare us, and spare thyself the repetition
    Of our most awful, but inexorable
    Duty to Heaven and man!

    _Ang_.                 Yet speak; I cannot--                       340
    I cannot--no--even now believe these things.
    Is _he_ condemned?

    _Ben_.            Alas!

    _Ang_.                   And was he guilty?

    _Ben_. Lady! the natural distraction of
    Thy thoughts at such a moment makes the question
    Merit forgiveness; else a doubt like this
    Against a just and paramount tribunal
    Were deep offence. But question even the Doge,
    And if he can deny the proofs, believe him
    Guiltless as thy own bosom.

    _Ang_.                       Is it so?
    My Lord, my Sovereign, my poor father's friend,                    350
    The mighty in the field, the sage in Council,
    Unsay the words of this man!--thou art silent!

    _Ben_. He hath already owned to his own guilt,[fh]
    Nor, as thou see'st, doth he deny it now.

    _Ang_. Aye, but he must not die! Spare his few years,
    Which Grief and Shame will soon cut down to days!
    One day of baffled crime must not efface
    Near sixteen lustres crowned with brave acts.

    _Ben_. His doom must be fulfilled without remission
    Of time or penalty--'tis a decree.                                 360

    _Ang_. He hath been guilty, but there may be mercy.

    _Ben_. Not in this case with justice.

    _Ang_.                                 Alas! Signor,
    He who is only just is cruel; who
    Upon the earth would live were all judged justly?

    _Ben_. His punishment is safety to the State.

    _Ang_. He was a subject, and hath served the State;
    He was your General, and hath saved the State;
    He is your Sovereign, and hath ruled the State.[fi]

    _One of the Council_. He is a traitor, and betrayed the State.

    _Ang_. And, but for him, there now had been no State               370
    To save or to destroy; and you, who sit
    There to pronounce the death of your deliverer,
    Had now been groaning at a Moslem oar,
    Or digging in the Hunnish mines in fetters!

    _One of the Council_. No, Lady, there are others who would die
    Rather than breathe in slavery!

    _Ang_.                           If there are so
    Within _these_ walls, _thou_ art not of the number:
    The truly brave are generous to the fallen!--
    Is there no hope?

    _Ben_.             Lady, it cannot be.

    _Ang_. (_turning to the Doge_).
    Then die, Faliero! since it must be so;                            380
    But with the spirit of my father's friend.
    Thou hast been guilty of a great offence,
    Half cancelled by the harshness of these men.
    I would have sued to them, have prayed to them.
    Have begged as famished mendicants for bread,
    Have wept as they will cry unto their God
    For mercy, and be answered as they answer,--
    Had it been fitting for thy name or mine,
    And if the cruelty in their cold eyes
    Had not announced the heartless wrath within.                      390
    Then, as a Prince, address thee to thy doom!

    _Doge_. I have lived too long not to know how to die!
    Thy suing to these men were but the bleating
    Of the lamb to the butcher, or the cry
    Of seamen to the surge: I would not take
    A life eternal, granted at the hands
    Of wretches, from whose monstrous villanies
    I sought to free the groaning nations!

    _Michel Steno_.                        Doge,
    A word with thee, and with this noble lady,
    Whom I have grievously offended. Would                             400
    Sorrow, or shame, or penance on my part,
    Could cancel the inexorable past!
    But since that cannot be, as Christians let us
    Say farewell, and in peace: with full contrition
    I crave, not pardon, but compassion from you,
    And give, however weak, my prayers for both.

    _Ang_. Sage Benintende, now chief Judge of Venice,
    I speak to thee in answer to yon Signor.
    Inform the ribald Steno, that his words
    Ne'er weighed in mind with Loredano's daughter,                    410
    Further than to create a moment's pity
    For such as he is: would that others had
    Despised him as I pity! I prefer
    My honour to a thousand lives, could such
    Be multiplied in mine, but would not have
    A single life of others lost for that
    Which nothing human can impugn--the sense
    Of Virtue, looking not to what is called
    A good name for reward, but to itself.
    To me the scorner's words were as the wind                         420
    Unto the rock: but as there are--alas!
    Spirits more sensitive, on which such things
    Light as the Whirlwind on the waters; souls
    To whom Dishonour's shadow is a substance
    More terrible than Death, here and hereafter;
    Men whose vice is to start at Vice's scoffing,
    And who, though proof against all blandishments
    Of pleasure, and all pangs of Pain, are feeble
    When the proud name on which they pinnacled
    Their hopes is breathed on, jealous as the eagle                   430
    Of her high aiery;[459] let what we now[fj]
    Behold, and feel, and suffer, be a lesson
    To wretches how they tamper in their spleen
    With beings of a higher order. Insects
    Have made the lion mad ere now; a shaft
    I' the heel o'erthrew the bravest of the brave;
    A wife's Dishonour was the bane of Troy;
    A wife's Dishonour unkinged Rome for ever;
    An injured husband brought the Gauls to Clusium,
    And thence to Rome, which perished for a time;                     440
    An obscene gesture cost Caligula[460]
    His life, while Earth yet bore his cruelties;
    A virgin's wrong made Spain a Moorish province;
    And Steno's lie, couched in two worthless lines,
    Hath decimated Venice, put in peril
    A Senate which hath stood eight hundred years,
    Discrowned a Prince, cut off his crownless head,
    And forged new fetters for a groaning people!
    Let the poor wretch, like to the courtesan[461]
    Who fired Persepolis, be proud of this,                            450
    If it so please him--'twere a pride fit for him!
    But let him not insult the last hours of
    Him, who, whate'er he now is, _was_ a Hero,
    By the intrusion of his very prayers;
    Nothing of good can come from such a source,
