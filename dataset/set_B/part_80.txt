    Nor would we aught with him, nor now, nor ever:
    We leave him to himself, that lowest depth
    Of human baseness. Pardon is for men,
    And not for reptiles--we have none for Steno,
    And no resentment: things like him must sting,                     460
    And higher beings suffer; 'tis the charter
    Of Life. The man who dies by the adder's fang
    May have the crawler crushed, but feels no anger:
    'Twas the worm's nature; and some men are worms
    In soul, more than the living things of tombs.[462]

    _Doge_ (_to Ben._).
    Signor! complete that which you deem your duty.[fk]

    _Ben_. Before we can proceed upon that duty,
    We would request the Princess to withdraw;
    'Twill move her too much to be witness to it.

    _Ang_. I know it will, and yet I must endure it,                   470
    For 'tis a part of mine--I will not quit,
    Except by force, my husband's side--Proceed!
    Nay, fear not either shriek, or sigh, or tear;
    Though my heart burst, it shall be silent.--Speak!
    I have that within which shall o'ermaster all.

    _Ben_. Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice,
    Count of Val di Marino, Senator,
    And some time General of the Fleet and Army,
    Noble Venetian, many times and oft
    Intrusted by the state with high employments,                      480
    Even to the highest, listen to the sentence.
    Convict by many witnesses and proofs,
    And by thine own confession, of the guilt
    Of Treachery and Treason, yet unheard of[fl]
    Until this trial--the decree is Death--
    Thy goods are confiscate unto the State,
    Thy name is razed from out her records, save
    Upon a public day of thanksgiving
    For this our most miraculous deliverance,[fm]
    When thou art noted in our calendars                               490
    With earthquakes, pestilence, and foreign foes,
    And the great Enemy of man, as subject
    Of grateful masses for Heaven's grace in snatching
    Our lives and country from thy wickedness.
    The place wherein as Doge thou shouldst be painted
    With thine illustrious predecessors, is
    To be left vacant, with a death-black veil
    Flung over these dim words engraved beneath,--
    "This place is of Marino Faliero,
    Decapitated for his crimes."[463]

    _Doge_.                         "His _crimes_!"[464]500
    But let it be so:--it will be in vain.
    The veil which blackens o'er this blighted name,
    And hides, or seems to hide, these lineaments,
    Shall draw more gazers than the thousand portraits
    Which glitter round it in their pictured trappings--
    _Your_ delegated slaves--the people's tyrants!
    "Decapitated for his crimes!"--_What_ crimes?
    Were it not better to record the facts,
    So that the contemplator might approve,
    Or at the least learn _whence_ the crimes arose?                   510
    When the beholder knows a Doge conspired,
    Let him be told the cause--it is your history.

    _Ben_. Time must reply to that; our sons will judge
    Their fathers' judgment, which I now pronounce.
    As Doge, clad in the ducal robes and Cap,
    Thou shalt be led hence to the Giants' Staircase,
    Where thou and all our Princes are invested;
    And there, the Ducal Crown being first resumed
    Upon the spot where it was first assumed,
    Thy head shall be struck off; and Heaven have mercy                520
    Upon thy soul!

    _Doge_.          Is this the Giunta's sentence?

    _Ben_. It is.

    _Doge_.       I can endure it.--And the time?

    _Ben_. Must be immediate.--Make thy peace with God:
    Within an hour thou must be in His presence.

    _Doge_. I am _already_; and my blood will rise
    To Heaven before the souls of those who shed it.
    Are all my lands confiscated?[465]

    _Ben_.                         They are;
    And goods, and jewels, and all kind of treasure,
    Except two thousand ducats--these dispose of.

    _Doge_. That's harsh.--I would have fain reserved the lands        530
    Near to Treviso, which I hold by investment
    From Laurence the Count-bishop of Ceneda,[fn]
    In fief perpetual to myself and heirs,
    To portion them (leaving my city spoil,
    My palace and my treasures, to your forfeit)
    Between my consort and my kinsmen.

    _Ben_.                               These
    Lie under the state's ban--their Chief, thy nephew,
    In peril of his own life; but the Council
    Postpones his trial for the present. If
    Thou will'st a state unto thy widowed Princess,                    540
    Fear not, for we will do her justice.

    _Ang_.                                 Signors,
    I share not in your spoil! From henceforth, know
    I am devoted unto God alone,
    And take my refuge in the cloister.

    _Doge_.                             Come!
    The hour may be a hard one, but 'twill end.
    Have I aught else to undergo save Death?[fo]

    _Ben_. You have nought to do, except confess and die.
    The priest is robed, the scimitar is bare,
    And both await without.--But, above all,
    Think not to speak unto the people; they                           550
    Are now by thousands swarming at the gates,
    But these are closed: the Ten, the Avogadori,
    The Giunta, and the chief men of the Forty,
    Alone will be beholders of thy doom,
    And they are ready to attend the Doge.

    _Doge_. The Doge!

    _Ben_.           Yes, Doge, thou hast lived and thou shalt die
    A Sovereign; till the moment which precedes
    The separation of that head and trunk,
    That ducal crown and head shall be united.
    Thou hast forgot thy dignity in deigning                           560
    To plot with petty traitors; not so we,
    Who in the very punishment acknowledge
    The Prince. Thy vile accomplices have died
    The dog's death, and the wolf's; but them shall fall
    As falls the lion by the hunters, girt
    By those who feel a proud compassion for thee,
    And mourn even the inevitable death
    Provoked by thy wild wrath, and regal fierceness.
    Now we remit thee to thy preparation:
    Let it be brief, and we ourselves will be                          570
    Thy guides unto the place where first we were
    United to thee as thy subjects, and
    Thy Senate; and must now be parted from thee
    As such for ever, on the self-same spot.
    Guards! form the Doge's escort to his chamber.
                                                                [_Exeunt_.


                    SCENE II.--_The Doge's Apartment_.

        _The_ DOGE _as Prisoner, and the_ DUCHESS _attending him_.

    _Doge_. Now, that the priest is gone, 'twere useless all
    To linger out the miserable minutes;
    But one pang more, the pang of parting from thee,
    And I will leave the few last grains of sand,
    Which yet remain of the accorded hour,
    Still falling--I have done with Time.

    _Ang_.                                Alas!
    And I have been the cause, the unconscious cause;
    And for this funeral marriage, this black union,
    Which thou, compliant with my father's wish,
    Didst promise at _his_ death, thou hast sealed thine own.           10

    _Doge_. Not so: there was that in my spirit ever
    Which shaped out for itself some great reverse;
    The marvel is, it came not until now--
    And yet it was foretold me.

    _Ang_.                      How foretold you?

    _Doge_. Long years ago--so long, they are a doubt[466]
    In memory, and yet they live in annals:
    When I was in my youth, and served the Senate
    And Signory as Podesta and Captain
    Of the town of Treviso, on a day
    Of festival, the sluggish Bishop who                                20
    Conveyed the Host aroused my rash young anger,
    By strange delay, and arrogant reply
    To my reproof: I raised my hand and smote him,
    Until he reeled beneath his holy burthen;[fp]
    And as he rose from earth again, he raised
    His tremulous hands in pious wrath towards Heaven.
    Thence pointing to the Host, which had fallen from him,
    He turned to me, and said, "The Hour will come
    When he thou hast o'erthrown shall overthrow thee:
    The Glory shall depart from out thy house,                          30
    The Wisdom shall be shaken from thy soul,
    And in thy best maturity of Mind
    A madness of the heart shall seize upon thee;[fq]
    Passion shall tear thee when all passions cease
    In other men, or mellow into virtues;
    And Majesty which decks all other heads,
    Shall crown to leave thee headless; honours shall
    But prove to thee the heralds of Destruction,
    And hoary hairs of Shame, and both of Death,
    But not such death as fits an agéd man."40
    Thus saying, he passed on.--That Hour is come.

    _Ang_. And with this warning couldst thou not have striven
    To avert the fatal moment, and atone,
    By penitence, for that which thou hadst done?

    _Doge_. I own the words went to my heart, so much
    That I remembered them amid the maze
    Of Life, as if they formed a spectral voice,
    Which shook me in a supernatural dream;
    And I repented; but 'twas not for me
    To pull in resolution:[467] what must be                            50
    I could not change, and would not fear.--Nay more,
    Thou can'st not have forgot, what all remember,
    That on my day of landing here as Doge,[468]
    On my return from Rome, a mist of such
    Unwonted density went on before
    The Bucentaur, like the columnar cloud
    Which ushered Israel out of Egypt, till
    The pilot was misled, and disembarked us
    Between the Pillars of Saint Mark's, where 'tis
    The custom of the state to put to death                             60
    Its criminals, instead of touching at
    The Riva della Paglia, as the wont is,--
    So that all Venice shuddered at the omen.

    _Ang_. Ah! little boots it now to recollect
    Such things.

    _Doge_.      And yet I find a comfort in
    The thought, that these things are the work of Fate;
    For I would rather yield to Gods than men,
    Or cling to any creed of destiny,
    Rather than deem these mortals, most of whom[fr]
    I know to be as worthless as the dust,                              70
    And weak as worthless, more than instruments
    Of an o'er-ruling Power; they in themselves
    Were all incapable--they could not be
    Vistors of him who oft had conquered for them.

    _Ang_. Employ the minutes left in aspirations
    Of a more healing nature, and in peace
    Even with these wretches take thy flight to Heaven.

    _Doge_. I _am_ at peace: the peace of certainty
    That a sure Hour will come, when their sons' sons,
    And this proud city, and these azure waters,                        80
    And all which makes them eminent and bright,
    Shall be a desolation and a curse,
    A hissing and a scoff unto the nations,
    A Carthage, and a Tyre, an Ocean Babel.

    _Ang_. Speak not thus now: the surge of Passion still
    Sweeps o'er thee to the last; thou dost deceive
    Thyself, and canst not injure them--be calmer.

    _Doge_. I stand within Eternity, and see
    Into Eternity, and I behold--
    Aye, palpable as I see thy sweet face                               90
    For the last time--the days which I denounce
    Unto all time against these wave-girt walls,
    And they who are indwellers.

    _Guard_ (_coming forward_).   Doge of Venice,
    The Ten are in attendance on your Highness.

    _Doge_. Then farewell, Angiolina!--one embrace--
    Forgive the old man who hath been to thee
    A fond but fatal husband--love my memory--
    I would not ask so much for me still living,
    But thou canst judge of me more kindly now,
    Seeing my evil feelings are at rest.                               100
    Besides, of all the fruit of these long years,
    Glory, and Wealth, and Power, and Fame, and Name,
    Which generally leave some flowers to bloom
    Even o'er the grave, I have nothing left, not even
    A little love, or friendship, or esteem,
    No, not enough to extract an epitaph
    From ostentatious kinsmen; in one hour
    I have uprooted all my former life,
    And outlived everything, except thy heart,
    The pure, the good, the gentle, which will oft                     110
    With unimpaired but not a clamorous grief[fs]
    Still keep----Thou turn'st so pale!--Alas! she faints,
    She has no breath, no pulse!--Guards! lend your aid--
    I cannot leave her thus, and yet 'tis better,
    Since every lifeless moment spares a pang.
    When she shakes off this temporary death,
    I shall be with the Eternal.--Call her women--
    One look!--how cold her hand!--as cold as mine
    Shall be ere she recovers.--Gently tend her,
    And take my last thanks--I am ready now.                           120

                       [_The Attendants of_ ANGIOLINA _enter, and surround
                       their Mistress, who has fainted.--Exeunt the_ DOGE,
                                                      _Guards, etc., etc._


    SCENE III.--_The Court of the Ducal Palace; the outer gates
      are shut against the people.--The_ DOGE _enters in his ducal
      robes, in procession with the_ COUNCIL OF TEN _and other Patricians,
      attended by the Guards, till they arrive at the top of the
      "Giants' Staircase[469] (where the Doges took the oaths); the
      the Executioner is stationed there with his sword.--On arriving, a_
      CHIEF OF THE TEN _takes off the ducal cap from the Doge's head_.

    _Doge_. So now the Doge is nothing, and at last
    I am again Marino Faliero:
    'Tis well to be so, though but for a moment,[ft]
    Here was I crowned, and here, bear witness, Heaven!
    With how much more contentment I resign
    That shining mockery, the ducal bauble,
    Than I received the fatal ornament.

    _One of the Ten_. Thou tremblest, Faliero!

    _Doge_.                                    'Tis with age, then.[470]

    _Ben_. Faliero! hast thou aught further to commend,
    Compatible with justice, to the Senate?                             10

    _Doge_. I would commend my nephew to their mercy,
    My consort to their justice; for methinks
    My death, and such a death, might settle all
    Between the State and me.

    _Ben_.                    They shall be cared for;
    Even notwithstanding thine unheard-of crime.

    _Doge_. Unheard of! aye, there's not a history
    But shows a thousand crowned conspirators
    _Against_ the people; but to set them free,
    One Sovereign only died, and one is dying.

    _Ben_. And who were they who fell in such a cause?                  20

    _Doge_. The King of Sparta, and the Doge of Venice--
    Agis and Faliero!

    _Ben_.           Hast thou more
    To utter or to do?

    _Doge_.            May I speak?

    _Ben_.                         Thou may'st;
    But recollect the people are without,
    Beyond the compass of the human voice.

    _Doge_. I speak to Time and to Eternity,
    Of which I grow a portion, not to man.
    Ye Elements! in which to be resolved
    I hasten, let my voice be as a Spirit
    Upon you! Ye blue waves! which bore my banner.                      30
    Ye winds! which fluttered o'er as if you loved it,
    And filled my swelling sails as they were wafted
    To many a triumph! Thou, my native earth,
    Which I have bled for! and thou, foreign earth,
    Which drank this willing blood from many a wound!
    Ye stones, in which my gore will not sink, but
    Reek up to Heaven! Ye skies, which will receive it!
    Thou Sun! which shinest on these things, and Thou!
    Who kindlest and who quenchest suns!--Attest![fu]
    I am not innocent--but are these guiltless?                         40
    I perish, but not unavenged; far ages
    Float up from the abyss of Time to be,
    And show these eyes, before they close, the doom
    Of this proud City, and I leave my curse
    On her and hers for ever!----Yes, the hours
    Are silently engendering of the day,
    When she, who built 'gainst Attila a bulwark,
    Shall yield, and bloodlessly and basely yield,
    Unto a bastard Attila,[471] without
    Shedding so much blood in her last defence,                         50
    As these old veins, oft drained in shielding her,
    Shall pour in sacrifice.--She shall be bought
    And sold, and be an appanage to those
    Who shall despise her![472]--She shall stoop to be
    A province for an Empire, petty town
    In lieu of Capital, with slaves for senates,
    Beggars for nobles, panders for a people![fv]
    Then when the Hebrew's in thy palaces,[473]
    The Hun in thy high places, and the Greek
    Walks o'er thy mart, and smiles on it for his;                      60
    When thy patricians beg their bitter bread
    In narrow streets, and in their shameful need
    Make their nobility a plea for pity;
    Then, when the few who still retain a wreck
    Of their great fathers' heritage shall fawn
    Round a barbarian Vice of Kings' Vice-gerent,[474]
    Even in the Palace where they swayed as Sovereigns,
    Even in the Palace where they slew their Sovereign,
    Proud of some name they have disgraced, or sprung
    From an adulteress boastful of her guilt                            70
    With some large gondolier or foreign soldier,
    Shall bear about their bastardy in triumph
    To the third spurious generation;--when
    Thy sons are in the lowest scale of being,
    Slaves turned o'er to the vanquished by the victors,
    Despised by cowards for greater cowardice,
    And scorned even by the vicious for such vices
    As in the monstrous grasp of their conception
    Defy all codes to image or to name them;
    Then, when of Cyprus, now thy subject kingdom,                      80
    All thine inheritance shall be her shame
    Entailed on thy less virtuous daughters, grown
    A wider proverb for worse prostitution;--
    When all the ills of conquered states shall cling thee,
    Vice without splendour, Sin without relief[fw][475]
    Even from the gloss of Love to smooth it o'er,
    But in its stead, coarse lusts of habitude,[476]
    Prurient yet passionless, cold studied lewdness,
    Depraving Nature's frailty to an art;--
    When these and more are heavy on thee, when                         90
    Smiles without mirth, and pastimes without Pleasure,
    Youth without Honour, Age without respect,
    Meanness and Weakness, and a sense of woe
    'Gainst which thou wilt not strive, and dar'st not murmur,[477]
    Have made thee last and worst of peopled deserts,
    Then, in the last gasp of thine agony,
    Amidst thy many murders, think of _mine!_
    Thou den of drunkards with the blood of Princes![478]
    Gehenna of the waters! thou Sea-Sodom![fx][479]
    Thus I devote thee to the Infernal Gods!                           100
    Thee and thy serpent seed!
                   [_Here the_ DOGE _turns and addresses the Executioner._
                               Slave, do thine office!
    Strike as I struck the foe! Strike as I would
    Have struck those tyrants! Strike deep as my curse!
    Strike--and but once!

                        [_The_ DOGE _throws himself upon his knees, and as
                       the Executioner raises his sword the scene closes._


          SCENE IV.--_The Piazza and Piazzetta of St. Mark's.--
           The people in crowds gathered round the grated gates
                  of the Ducal Palace, which are shut._

    _First Citizen_. I have gained the Gate, and can discern the Ten,
    Robed in their gowns of state, ranged round the Doge.

    _Second Cit_. I cannot reach thee with mine utmost effort.
    How is it? let us hear at least, since sight
    Is thus prohibited unto the people,
    Except the occupiers of those bars.

    _First Cit_. One has approached the Doge, and now they strip
    The ducal bonnet from his head--and now
    He raises his keen eyes to Heaven; I see
    Them glitter, and his lips move--Hush! hush!--no,                   10
    'Twas but a murmur--Curse upon the distance!
    His words are inarticulate, but the voice
    Swells up like muttered thunder; would we could
    But gather a sole sentence!

    _Second Cit_. Hush! we perhaps may catch the sound.

    _First Cit_.                                        'Tis vain.
    I cannot hear him.--How his hoary hair
    Streams on the wind like foam upon the wave!
    Now--now--he kneels--and now they form a circle
    Round him, and all is hidden--but I see

[377] {338}While I was in the sub-committee of Drury Lane Theatre, I can
vouch for my colleagues, and I hope for myself, that we did our best to
bring back the legitimate drama. I tried what I could to get _De
Montford_ revived, but in vain, and equally in vain in favour of
Sotheby's _Ivan_, which was thought an acting play; and I endeavoured
also to wake Mr. Coleridge to write us a tragedy[A]. Those who are not
in the secret will hardly believe that the _School for Scandal_ is the
play which has brought the _least money_, averaging the number of times
it has been acted since its production; so Manager Dibdin assured me. Of
what has occurred since Maturin's _Bertram_ I am not aware[B]; so that I
may be traducing, through ignorance, some excellent new writers; if so,
I beg their pardon. I have been absent from England nearly five years,
and, till last year, I never read an English newspaper since my
departure, and am now only aware of theatrical matters through the
medium of the _Parisian Gazette_ of Galignani, and only for the last
twelve months. Let me, then, deprecate all offence to tragic or comic
writers, to whom I wish well, and of whom I know nothing. The long
complaints of the actual state of the drama arise, however, from no
fault of the performers. I can conceive nothing better than Kemble,
Cooke, and Kean, in their very different manners, or than Elliston in
_Gentleman's_ comedy, and in some parts of tragedy. Miss O'Neill[C] I
never saw, having made and kept a determination to see nothing which
should divide or disturb my recollection of Siddons. Siddons and Kemble
were the _ideal_ of tragic action; I never saw anything at all
resembling them, even in _person_; for this reason, we shall never see
again Coriolanus or Macbeth. When Kean is blamed for want of dignity, we
should remember that it is a grace, not an art, and not to be attained
by study. In all, _not_ super-natural parts, he is perfect; even his
very defects belong, or seem to belong, to the parts themselves, and
appear truer to nature. But of Kemble we may say, with reference to his
acting, what the Cardinal de Retz said of the Marquis of Montrose, "that
he was the only man he ever saw who reminded him of the heroes of
Plutarch."[D]

[378] {339}[This appreciation of the _Mysterious Mother_, which he seems
to have read in Lord Dover's preface to Walpole's Letters to Sir Horace
Mann, provoked Coleridge to an angry remonstrance. "I venture to remark,
first, that I do not believe that Lord Byron spoke sincerely; for I
suspect that he made a tacit exception of himself at least.... Thirdly,
that the _Mysterious Mother_ is the most disgusting, vile, detestable
composition that ever came from the hand of man. No one with a spark of
true manliness, of which Horace Walpole had none, could have written
it."--_Table Talk_, March 20, 1834. Croker took a very different view,
and maintained "that the good old English blank verse, the force of
character expressed in the wretched mother ... argue a strength of
conception, and vigour of expression capable of great things," etc. Over
and above the reasonable hope and expectation that this provocative
eulogy of Walpole's play would annoy the "Cockneys" and the "Lakers,"
Byron was no doubt influenced in its favour by the audacity of the plot,
which not only put _septentrional_ prejudices at defiance, but was an
instance in point that love ought not "to make a tragic subject unless
it is love furious, criminal, and hopeless" (Letter to Murray, January
4, 1821). He would, too, be deeply and genuinely moved by such verse as
this--

    "Consult a holy man! inquire of him!
    --Good father, wherefore? what should I inquire?
    Must I be taught of him that guilt is woe?
    That innocence alone is happiness--
    That martyrdom itself shall leave the villain
    The villain that it found him? Must I learn
    That minutes stamped with crime are past recall?
    That joys are momentary; and remorse
    Eternal?...
    Nor could one risen from the dead proclaim
    This truth in deeper sounds to my conviction;
    We want no preacher to distinguish vice
    From virtue. At our birth the God revealed
    All conscience needs to know. No codicil
    To duty's rubric here and there was placed
    In some Saint's casual custody."

[379] {340}[Byron received a copy of Goethe's review of _Manfred_, which
appeared in _Kunst und Alterthum_ (ii. 2. 191) in May, 1820. In a letter
to Murray, dated October 17, 1820 (_Letters_, 1901, v. 100), he enclosed
a letter to Goethe, headed "For _Marino Faliero_. Dedication to Baron
Goethe, etc., etc., etc." It is possible that Murray did not take the
"Dedication" seriously, but regarded it as a _jeu d'esprit_, designed
for the amusement of himself and his "synod." At any rate, the
"Dedication" did not reach Goethe's hand till 1831, when it was
presented to him at Weimar by John Murray the Third. "It is written,"
says Moore, who printed a mutilated version in his _Letters and
Journals, etc._, 1830, ii. 356-358, "in the poet's most whimsical and
mocking mood; and the unmeasured severity poured out in it upon the two
favourite objects of his wrath and ridicule, compels me to deprive the
reader of its most amusing passages." The present text, which follows
the MS., is reprinted from _Letters_, 1901, v. 100-104--

     "Dedication to Baron Goethe, etc., etc., etc.

     "Sir--In the Appendix to an English work lately translated into
     German and published at Leipsic, a judgment of yours upon English
     poetry is quoted as follows: 'That in English poetry, great genius,
     universal power, a feeling of profundity, with sufficient
     tenderness and force, are to be found; but that _altogether these
     do not constitute poets_,' etc., etc.

     "I regret to see a great man falling into a great mistake. This
     opinion of yours only proves that the '_Dictionary of Ten Thousand
     living English Authors_'[A] has not been translated into German.
     You will have read, in your friend Schlegel's version, the dialogue
     in _Macbeth_--

                    "'There are _ten thousand!_
    _Macbeth_. _Geese_, villain?
    _Answer_.                       _Authors_, sir.'[B]

     Now, of these 'ten thousand authors,' there are actually nineteen
     hundred and eighty-seven poets, all alive at this moment, whatever
     their works may be, as their booksellers well know: and amongst
     these there are several who possess a far greater reputation than
     mine, though considerably less than yours. It is owing to this
     neglect on the part of your German translators that you are not
     aware of the works of William Wordsworth, who has a baronet in
     London[C] who draws him frontispieces and leads him about to
     dinners and to the play; and a Lord in the country,[D] who gave him
     a place in the Excise--and a cover at his table. You do not know
     perhaps that this Gentleman is the greatest of all poets
     past--present and to come--besides which he has written an '_Opus
     Magnum_' in prose--during the late election for Westmoreland.[E]
     His principal publication is entitled '_Peter Bell_' which he had
     withheld from the public for '_one and twenty years_'--to the
     irreparable loss of all those who died in the interim, and will
     have no opportunity of reading it before the resurrection. There is
     also another named Southey, who is more than a poet, being actually
     poet Laureate,--a post which corresponds with what we call in Italy
     Poeta Cesareo, and which you call in German--I know not what; but
     as you have a '_Caesar_'--probably you have a name for it. In
     England there is no _Caesar_--only the Poet.

     "I mention these poets by way of sample to enlighten you. They form
     but two bricks of our Babel, (Windsor bricks, by the way) but may
     serve for a specimen of the building.

     "It is, moreover, asserted that 'the predominant character of the
     whole body of the present English poetry is a _disgust_ and
     _contempt_ for life.' But I rather suspect that by one single work
     of _prose_, _you_ yourself have excited a greater contempt for life
     than all the English volumes of poesy that ever were written.
     Madame de Stäel says, that 'Werther has occasioned more suicides
     than the most beautiful woman;' and I really believe that he has
     put more individuals out of this world than Napoleon
     himself,--except in the way of his profession. Perhaps, Illustrious
     Sir, the acrimonious judgment passed by a celebrated northern
     journal[F] upon you in particular, and the Germans in general, has
     rather indisposed you towards English poetry as well as criticism.
     But you must not regard our critics, who are at bottom good-natured
     fellows, considering their two professions,--taking up the law in
     court, and laying it down out of it. No one can more lament their
     hasty and unfair judgment, in your particular, than I do; and I so
     expressed myself to your friend Schlegel, in 1816, at Coppet.

     "In behalf of my 'ten thousand' living brethren, and of myself, I
     have thus far taken notice of an opinion expressed with regard to
     'English poetry' in general, and which merited notice, because it
     was yours.

     "My principal object in addressing you was to testify my sincere
     respect and admiration of a man, who, for half a century, has led
     the literature of a great nation, and will go down to posterity as
     the first literary Character of his Age.

     "You have been fortunate, Sir, not only in the writings which have
     illustrated your name, but in the name itself, as being
     sufficiently musical for the articulation of posterity. In this you
     have the advantage of some of your countrymen, whose names would
     perhaps be immortal also--if anybody could pronounce them.

     "It may, perhaps, be supposed, by this apparent tone of levity,
     that I am wanting in intentional respect towards you; but this will
     be a mistake: I am always flippant in prose. Considering you, as I
     really and warmly do, in common with all your own, and with most
     other nations, to be by far the first literary Character which has
     existed in Europe since the death of Voltaire, I felt, and feel,
     desirous to inscribe to you the following work,--_not_ as being
     either a tragedy or a _poem_, (for I cannot pronounce upon its
     pretensions to be either one or the other, or both, or neither,)
     but as a mark of esteem and admiration from a foreigner to the man
     who has been hailed in Germany 'the great Goethe.'

     "I have the honour to be,

     With the truest respect,

     Your most obedient and

     Very humble servant,

     Byron,

     "Ravenna, 8^bre^ 14º, 1820.

     "P.S.--I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a
     great struggle about what they call '_Classical_' and
     '_Romantic_,'--terms which were not subjects of classification in
     England, at least when I left it four or five years ago. Some of
     the English Scribblers, it is true, abused Pope and Swift, but the
     reason was that they themselves did not know how to write either
     prose or verse; but nobody thought them worth making a sect of.
     Perhaps there may be something of the kind sprung up lately, but I
     have not heard much about it, and it would be such bad taste that I
     shall be very sorry to believe it."

Another Dedication, to be prefixed to a Second Edition of the play was
found amongst Byron's papers. It remained in MS. till 1832, when it was
included in a prefatory note to _Marino Faliero, Works of Lord Byron_,
1832, xii. 50.

     would still be a very inadequate acknowledgment of the active and

rendering of Steno's Lampoon.--"Becco Marino Fallier dalla belta
mogier;" and there are older versions agreeing in the main with that
Faliero's by Sanudo. It is, however, extremely doubtful whether Faliro's
conspiracy was, in any sense, the outcome of a personal insult. The
story of the Lampoon first appears in the Chronicle of Lorenzo de
Monaci, who wrote in the latter half of the fifteenth century. "Fama
fuit ... quia aliqui adolescentuli nobiles scripserunt in angulis
interioris palatii aliqua verba ignominiosa, et quod ipse (il Doge)
magis incanduit quoniam adolescentuli illi parva fuerant animadversione

youth, whose name occurred in the annals, and the derivation or
evolution of the "verba ignominiosa," followed by a natural
process.--_La Congiura, Nuona Archivio Veneto_, 1897, tom. xiii. pt. ii.

[389] {356}[According to the much earlier, and, presumably, more
historical narrative of Lorenzo de Monaci, Bertuccio Isarello was not
chief of the _Arsenalotti_, but simply the patron, that is the owner, of
a vessel (_paron di nave_), and consequently a person of importance
amongst sailors and naval artisans; and the noble who strikes the fatal
blow is not Barbaro, but a certain Giovanni Dandolo, who is known, at
that time, to have been "_sopracomito and consigliere del capitano da
mar_." If the Admiral of the Arsenal had been engaged in the conspiracy,
the fact could hardly have escaped the notice of contemporary
chroniclers. Signor Lazzarino suggests that the name Gisello, or
Girello, which has been substituted for that of Israel Bertuccio, is a
corruption of Isarello.--_La Congiura_, p. 74.]

[394] {360}[The famous measure known as the closing of the Great Council
was carried into force during the Dogeship (1289-1311) of Pietro
Gradenigo. On the last day of February, 1297, a law was proposed and
passed, "That the Council of Forty are to ballot, one by one, the names
of all those who during the last four years have had a seat in the Great
Council.... Three electors shall be chosen to submit names of fresh
candidates for the Great Council, on the ... approval of the Doge." But
strict as these provisions were, they did not suffice to restrict the
government to the aristocracy. It was soon decreed "that only those who
could prove that a paternal ancestor had sat on the Great Council, after
its creation in 1176, should now be eligible as members.... It is in
this provision that we find the essence of the _Serrata del Maggior
Consiglio_.... The work was not completed at one stroke.... In 1315 a
list of all those who were eligible ... was compiled. The scrutiny ...
was entrusted to the _Avogadori di Comun_, and became ... more and more
severe. To ensure the purity of blood, they opened a register of
marriages and births.... Thus the aristocracy proceeded to construct
itself more and more upon a purely oligarchical basis."--_Venice, an
Historical Sketch_, by Horatio F. Brown, 1893, pp. 162-164.]

[396] {363}[The bells of San Marco were never rung but by order of the
Doge. One of the pretexts for ringing this alarm was to have been an
announcement of the appearance of a Genoese fleet off the Lagune.
According to Sanudo, "on the appointed day they [the followers of the
sixteen leaders of the conspiracy] were to make affrays amongst
themselves, here and there, in order that the Duke might have a pretence
for tolling the bells of San Marco." (See, too, _Sketches from Venetian
History, 1831, i. 266, note._)]

[402] [Byron admits (_vide ante_, p. 340) that the character of the
"Dogaressa" is more or less his own creation. It may be remarked that in
Casimir Delavigne's version of the story, the Duchess (Elena) cherishes
a secret and criminal attachment for Bertuccio Faliero, and that in Mr.
Swinburne's tragedy, while innocent in act, she is smitten with remorse
for a passion which overmasters her loyalty to her husband. Byron's
Angiolina is "faultily faultless, ... splendidly null."

In a letter to Murray, dated January 4, 1821 (_Letters_, 1901, v. 218),
he says, "As I think that _love_ is not the principal passion for
tragedy, you will not find me a popular writer. Unless it is Love,
_furious_, _criminal_, and _hapless_ [as in _The Mysterious Mother_, or
in Alfieri's _Mirra_, or Shelley's _Cenci_], it ought not to make a
tragic subject. When it is melting and maudlin, it _does_, but it ought
not to do; it is then for the gallery and second-price boxes." It is
probable that he owed these sentiments to the theory and practice of
Vittorio Alfieri. "It is extraordinary," writes M. de Fallette Barrol
(_Monthly Magazine_, April, 1805, reprinted in Preface to _Tragedie di
Alfieri_, A. Montucci, Edinburgh, 1805, i. xvi. _sq._), "that a man
whose soul possessed an uncommon share of ardour and sensibility, and
had experienced all the violence of the passions, should scarcely have
condescended to introduce love into his tragedies; or, when he does,
that he should only employ it with a kind of reserve and severity.... He
probably regarded it as a hackneyed agent; for in ... _Myrrha_ it
appears in such a strange character, that all the art of the writer is
not capable of divesting it of an air at once ludicrous and disgusting."

But apart from the example of Alfieri, there was another motive at
work--a determination to prove to the world that he was the master of
his own temperament, and that, if he chose, he could cast away frivolity
and cynicism, and clothe himself with austerity "as with a garment." He
had been taken to task for "treating well-nigh with equal derision the
most pure of virtues, and the most odious of vices" (_Blackwood's Edin.
Mag._, August, 1819), and here was an "answer to his accusers!"]

which Calendario is described as _commissario_, i.e. executor, of Piero
Basejo, who worked as a master stone-cutter for the Republic. The

other coincidences arising from the subject. I need hardly remind the
gentlest reader, that such coincidences must be accidental, from the
very facility of their detection by reference to so popular a play on
the stage and in the closet as Otway's chef-d'oeuvre.

[472] Should the dramatic picture seem harsh, let the reader look to the
historical of the period prophesied, or rather of the few years
preceding that period. Voltaire calculated their "nostre bene merite
Meretrici" at 12,000 of regulars, without including volunteers and local
militia, on what authority I know not; but it is, perhaps, the only part
of the population not decreased. Venice once contained two hundred
thousand inhabitants: there are now about ninety thousand; and THESE!!
few individuals can conceive, and none could describe, the actual state
into which the more than infernal tyranny of Austria has plunged this
unhappy city. From the present decay and degeneracy of Venice under the
Barbarians, there are some honourable individual exceptions. There is
Pasqualigo, the last, and, alas! _posthumous_ son of the marriage of the
Doges with the Adriatic, who fought his frigate with far greater
gallantry than any of his French coadjutors in the memorable action off
Lissa. I came home in the squadron with the prizes in 1811, and
recollect to have heard Sir William Hoste, and the other officers
engaged in that glorious conflict, speak in the highest terms of
Pasqualigo's behaviour. There is the Abbate Morelli. There is Alvise
Querini, who, after a long and honourable diplomatic career, finds some
consolation for the wrongs of his country, in the pursuits of literature
with his nephew, Vittor Benzon, the son of the celebrated beauty, the
heroine of "La Biondina in Gondoleta." There are the patrician poet
Morosini, and the poet Lamberti, the author of the "Biondina," etc., and
many other estimable productions; and, not least in an Englishman's
estimation, Madame Michelli, the translator of Shakspeare. There are the
young Dandolo and the improvvisatore Carrer, and Giuseppe Albrizzi, the
accomplished son of an accomplished mother. There is Aglietti, and were
there nothing else, there is the immortality of Canova. Cicognara,
Mustoxithi, Bucati, etc., etc., I do not reckon, because the one is a
Greek, and the others were born at least a hundred miles off, which,
throughout Italy, constitutes, if not a _foreigner_, at least a
_stranger_ (_forestiére_).

it is less evident why Byron, doubtless quoting from _Hamlet_, calls
Napoleon the "Vice of Kings." Did he mean a "player-king," one who not
being a king acted the part, as the "vice" in the old moralities; or did
he misunderstand Shakespeare, and seek to depreciate Beauharnais as the
Viceroy of a Viceroy, that is Joseph Bonaparte?]

[477] {459}If the Doge's prophecy seem remarkable, look to the
following, made by Alamanni two hundred and seventy years ago;--"There
is one very singular prophecy concerning Venice: 'If thou dost not
change,' it says to that proud republic, 'thy liberty, which is already
on the wing, will not reckon a century more than the thousandth year.'
If we carry back the epocha of Venetian freedom to the establishment of
the government under which the republic flourished, we shall find that
the date of the election of the first Doge is 697: and if we add one
century to a thousand, that is, eleven hundred years, we shall find the
sense of the prediction to be literally this: 'Thy liberty will not last
till 1797.' Recollect that Venice ceased to be free in the year 1796,
the fifth year of the French republic; and you will perceive that there
never was prediction more pointed, or more exactly followed by the
event. You will, therefore, note as very remarkable the three lines of
Alamanni addressed to Venice; which, however, no one has pointed out:--

    "'Se non cangi pensier, l'un secol solo
      Non conterà sopra 'l millesimo anno
      Tua libertà, che va fuggendo a volo.'

Many prophecies have passed for such, and many men have been called
prophets for much less."--P. L. Ginguené, _Hist. Lit. d'Italie_, ix. 144
[Paris Edition, 1819].

[478] Of the first fifty Doges, _five_ abdicated--_five_ were banished
with their eyes put out--_five_ were massacred--and _nine_ deposed; so
that _nineteen_ out of fifty lost the throne by violence, besides two
who fell in battle: this occurred long previous to the reign of Marino
Faliero. One of his more immediate predecessors, Andrea Dandolo, died of
vexation. Marino Faliero himself perished as related. Amongst his
successors, _Foscari_, after seeing his son repeatedly tortured and
banished, was deposed, and died of breaking a blood-vessel, on hearing
the bell of Saint Mark's toll for the election of his successor.
Morosini was impeached for the loss of Candia; but this was previous to
his dukedom, during which he conquered the Morea, and was styled the
Peloponnesian. Faliero might truly say,--

I am obliged for the following excellent translation of the old
Chronicle to Mr. F. Cohen,[483] to whom the reader will find himself
indebted for a version that I could not myself--though after many years'
intercourse with Italian--have given by any means so purely and so
faithfully.


Story of Marino Faliero, Doge XLIV. mcccliv.[483a]


On the eleventh day of September, in the year of our Lord, 1354, Marino
Faliero was elected and chosen to be the Duke of the Commonwealth of
Venice. He was Count of Valdemarino, in the Marches of Treviso, and a
Knight, and a wealthy man to boot. As soon as the election was
completed, it was resolved in the Great Council, that a deputation of
twelve should be despatched to Marino Faliero the Duke, who was then on
his way from Rome; for when he was chosen, he was ambassador at the
court of the Holy Father, at Rome,--the Holy Father himself held his
court at Avignon. When Messer Marino Faliero the Duke was about to land
in this city, on the 5th day of October, 1354, a thick haze came on and
darkened the air: and he was enforced to land on the place of Saint
Mark, between the two columns, on the spot where evil doers are put to
death; and all thought that this was the worst of tokens.--Nor must I
forget to write that which I have read in a chronicle.--When Messer
Marino Faliero was Podesta and Captain of Treviso, the Bishop delayed
coming in with the holy sacrament, on a day when a procession was to
take place. Now, the said Marino Faliero was so very proud and wrathful,
that he buffeted the Bishop, and almost struck him to the ground: and,
therefore, Heaven allowed Marino Faliero to go out of his right senses,
in order that he might bring himself to an evil death.

When this Duke had held the dukedom during nine months and six days, he,
being wicked and ambitious, sought to make himself Lord of Venice, in
the manner which I have read in an ancient chronicle. When the Thursday
arrived upon which they were wont to hunt the bull, the bull hunt took
place as usual; and, according to the usage of those times, after the
bull hunt had ended, they all proceeded unto the palace of the Duke, and
assembled together in one of his halls; and they disported themselves
with the women. And until the first bell tolled they danced, and then a
banquet was served up. My Lord the Duke paid the expenses thereof,
provided he had a Duchess, and after the banquet they all returned to
their homes.

Now to this feast there came a certain Ser Michele Steno, a gentleman of
poor estate and very young, but crafty and daring, and who loved one of
the damsels of the Duchess. Ser Michele stood amongst the women upon the
solajo; and he behaved indiscreetly, so that my Lord the Duke ordered
that he should be kicked off the solajo [i.e. platform]; and the
esquires of the Duke flung him down from the solajo accordingly. Ser
Michele thought that such an affront was beyond all bearing; and when
the feast was over, and all other persons had left the palace, he,
continuing heated with anger, went to the hall of audience, and wrote
certain unseemly words relating to the Duke and the Duchess upon the
chair in which the Duke was used to sit; for in those days the Duke did
not cover his chair with cloth of sendal, but he sat in a chair of wood.
Ser Michele wrote thereon--"_Marin Falier, the husband of the fair wife;
others kiss her, but he keeps her._"[484] In the morning the words were
seen, and the matter was considered to be very scandalous; and the
Senate commanded the Avogadori of the Commonwealth to proceed therein
with the greatest diligence. A largess of great amount was immediately
proffered by the Avogadori, in order to discover who had written these
words. And at length it was known that Michele Steno had written them.
It was resolved in the Council of Forty that he should be arrested; and
he then confessed that in the fit of vexation and spite, occasioned by
his being thrust off the solajo in the presence of his mistress, he had
written the words. Therefore the Council debated thereon. And the
Council took his youth into consideration, and that he was a lover; and
therefore they adjudged that he should be kept in close confinement
during two months, and that afterwards he should be banished from Venice
and the state during one year. In consequence of this merciful sentence
the Duke became exceedingly wroth, it appearing to him, that the Council
had not acted in such a manner as was required by the respect due to his
ducal dignity; and he said that they ought to have condemned Ser Michele
to be hanged by the neck, or at least to be banished for life.

Now it was fated that my Lord Duke Marino was to have his head cut off.
And as it is necessary when any effect is to be brought about, that the
cause of such effect must happen, it therefore came to pass, that on the
very day after sentence had been pronounced on Ser Michele Steno, being
the first day of Lent, a gentleman of the house of Barbara, a choleric
gentleman, went to the arsenal, and required certain things of the
masters of the galleys. This he did in the presence of the Admiral of
the arsenal, and he, bearing the request, answered, No, it cannot be
done. High words arose between the gentleman and the Admiral, and the
gentleman struck him with his fist just above the eye; and as he
happened to have a ring on his finger, the ring cut the Admiral and drew
blood. The Admiral, all bruised and bloody, ran straight to the Duke to
complain, and with the intent of praying him to inflict some heavy
punishment upon the gentleman of Cà Barbaro.--"What wouldst thou have me
do for thee?" answered the Duke: "think upon the shameful gibe which
hath been written concerning me; and think on the manner in which they
have punished that ribald Michele Steno, who wrote it; and see how the
Council of Forty respect our person."--Upon this the Admiral answered,
"My Lord Duke, if you would wish to make yourself a prince, and to cut
all those cuckoldy gentlemen to pieces, I have the heart, if you do but
help me, to make you prince of all this state; and then you may punish
them all." Hearing this, the Duke said, "How can such a matter be
brought about?"--and so they discoursed thereon.

The Duke called for his nephew, Ser Bertuccio Faliero, who lived with
him in the palace, and they communed about this plot. And without
leaving the place, they sent for Philip Calendaro, a seaman of great
repute, and for Bertuccio Israello, who was exceedingly wily and
cunning. Then taking counsel among themselves, they agreed to call in
some others; and so, for several nights successively, they met with the
Duke at home in his palace. And the following men were called in singly;
to wit:--Niccolo Fagiuolo, Giovanni da Corfu, Stefano Fagiono, Niccolo
dalle Bende, Niccolo Biondo, and Stefano Trivisano.--It was concerted
that sixteen or seventeen leaders should be stationed in various parts
of the city, each being at the head of forty men, armed and prepared;
but the followers were not to know their destination. On the appointed
day they were to make affrays amongst themselves here and there, in
order that the Duke might have a pretence for tolling the bells of San
Marco; these bells are never rung but by the order of the Duke. And at
the sound of the bells, these sixteen or seventeen, with their
followers, were to come to San Marco, through the streets which open
upon the Piazza. And when the noble and leading citizens should come
into the Piazza, to know the cause of the riot, then the conspirators
were to cut them in pieces; and this work being finished, my Lord Marino
Faliero the Duke was to be proclaimed the Lord of Venice. Things having
been thus settled, they agreed to fulfil their intent on Wednesday, the
15th day of April, in the year 1355. So covertly did they plot, that no
one ever dreamt of their machinations.

But the Lord, who hath always helped this most glorious city, and who,
loving its righteousness and holiness, hath never forsaken it, inspired
one Beltramo Bergamasco to be the cause of bringing the plot to light,
in the following manner. This Beltramo, who belonged to Ser Niccolo
Lioni of Santo Stefano, had heard a word or two of what was to take
place; and so, in the above-mentioned month of April, he went to the
house of the aforesaid Ser Niccolo Lioni, and told him all the
particulars of the plot. Ser Niccolo, when he heard all these things,
was struck dead, as it were, with affright. He heard all the
particulars; and Beltramo prayed him to keep it all secret; and if he
told Ser Niccolo, it was in order that Ser Niccolo might stop at home on
the 15th of April, and thus save his life. Beltramo was going, but Ser
Niccolo ordered his servants to lay hands upon him, and lock him up. Ser
Niccolo then went to the house of Messer Giovanni Gradenigo Nasoni, who
afterwards became Duke, and who also lived at Santo Stefano, and told
him all. The matter seemed to him to be of the very greatest importance,
as indeed it was; and they two went to the house of Ser Marco Cornaro,
who lived at San Felice; and, having spoken with him, they all three
then determined to go back to the house of Ser Niccolo Lioni, to examine
the said Beltramo; and having questioned him, and heard all that he had
to say, they left him in confinement. And then they all three went into
the sacristy of San Salvatore, and sent their men to summon the
Councillors, the Avogadori, the Capi de' Dieci, and those of the Great
Council.

When all were assembled, the whole story was told to them. They were
struck dead, as it were, with affright. They determined to send for
Beltramo. He was brought in before them. They examined him, and
ascertained that the matter was true; and, although they were
exceedingly troubled, yet they determined upon their measures. And they
sent for the Capi de' Quarante, the Signori di Notte, the Capi de'
Sestieri, and the Cinque della Pace; and they were ordered to associate
to their men other good men and true, who were to proceed to the houses
of the ringleaders of the conspiracy, and secure them. And they secured
the foreman of the arsenal, in order that the conspirators might not do
mischief. Towards nightfall they assembled in the palace. When they were
assembled in the palace, they caused the gates of the quadrangle of the
palace to be shut. And they sent to the keeper of the Bell-tower, and
forbade the tolling of the bells. All this was carried into effect. The
before-mentioned conspirators were secured, and they were brought to the
palace; and, as the Council of Ten saw that the Duke was in the plot,
they resolved that twenty of the leading men of the state should be
associated to them, for the purpose of consultation and deliberation,
but that they should not be allowed to ballot.

The counsellors were the following:--Ser Giovanni Mocenigo, of the
Sestiero of San Marco; Ser Almoro Veniero da Santa Marina, of the
Sestiero of Castello; Ser Tomaso Viadro, of the Sestiero of Canaregio;
Ser Giovanni Sanudo, of the Sestiero of Santa Croce; Ser Pietro
Trivisano, of the Sestiero of San Paolo; Ser Pantalione Barbo il Grando,
of the Sestiero of Ossoduro. The Avogadori of the Commonwealth were
Zufredo Morosini, and Ser Orio Pasqualigo; and these did not ballot.
Those of the Council of Ten were Ser Giovanni Marcello, Ser Tomaso
Sanudo, and Ser Micheletto Dolfino, the heads of the aforesaid Council
of Ten. Ser Luca da Legge, and Ser Pietro da Mosto, inquisitors of the
aforesaid Council. And Ser Marco Polani, Ser Marino Veniero, Ser Lando
Lombardo, and Ser Nicoletto Trivisano, of Sant' Angelo.

Late in the night, just before the dawning, they chose a junta of
twenty noblemen of Venice from amongst the wisest, and the worthiest,
and the oldest. They were to give counsel, but not to ballot. And they
would not admit any one of Cà Faliero. And Niccolo Faliero, and another
Niccolo Faliero, of San Tomaso, were expelled from the Council, because
they belonged to the family of the Doge. And this resolution of creating
the junta of twenty was much praised throughout the state. The following
were the members of the junta of twenty:--Ser Marco Giustiniani,
Procuratore, Ser Andrea Erizzo, Procuratore, Ser Lionardo Giustiniani,
Procuratore, Ser Andrea Contarini, Ser Simone Dandolo, Ser Niccolo
Volpe, Ser Giovanni Loredano, Ser Marco Diedo, Ser Giovanni Gradenigo,
Ser Andrea Cornaro Cavaliere, Ser Marco Soranzo, Ser Rinieri du Mosto,
Ser Gazano Marcello, Ser Marino Morosini, Ser Stefano Belegno, Ser
Niccolo Lioni, Ser Filippo Orio, Ser Marco Trivisano, Ser Jacopo
Bragadino, Ser Giovanni Foscarini.

These twenty were accordingly called in to the Council of Ten; and they
sent for my Lord Marino Faliero, the Duke: and my Lord Marino was then
consorting in the palace with people of great estate, gentlemen, and
other good men, none of whom knew yet how the fact stood.

At the same time Bertuccio Israello, who, as one of the ringleaders, was
to head the conspirators in Santa Croce, was arrested and bound, and
brought before the Council. Zanello del Brin, Nicoletto di Rosa,
Nicoletto Alberto, and the Guardiaga, were also taken, together with
several seamen, and people of various ranks. These were examined, and
the truth of the plot was ascertained.

On the 16th of April judgment was given in the Council of Ten, that
Filippo Calendaro and Bertuccio Israello should be hanged upon the red
pillars of the balcony of the palace, from which the Duke is wont to
look at the bull hunt: and they were hanged with gags in their mouths.

The next day the following were condemned:--Niccolo Zuccuolo, Nicoletto
Blondo, Nicoletto Doro, Marco Giuda, Jacomello Dagolino, Nicoletto
Fidele, the son of Filippo Calendaro, Marco Torello, called Israello,
Stefano Trivisano, the money-changer of Santa Margherita, and Antonio
dalle Bende. These were all taken at Chiozza, for they were endeavouring
to escape. Afterwards, by virtue of the sentence which was passed upon
them in the Council of Ten, they were hanged on successive days; some
singly and some in couples, upon the columns of the palace, beginning
from the red columns, and so going onwards towards the canal. And other
prisoners were discharged, because, although they had been involved in
the conspiracy, yet they had not assisted in it; for they were given to
understand by some of the heads of the plot, that they were to come
armed and prepared for the service of the state, and in order to secure
certain criminals; and they knew nothing else. Nicoletto Alberto, the
Guardiaga, and Bartolommeo Ciricolo and his son, and several others, who
were not guilty, were discharged.

On Friday, the 16th day of April, judgment was also given in the
aforesaid Council of Ten, that my Lord Marino Faliero, the Duke, should
have his head cut off; and that the execution should be done on the
landing-place of the stone staircase, where the Dukes take their oath
when they first enter the palace. On the following day, the 17th of
April, the doors of the palace being shut, the Duke had his head cut
off, about the hour of noon. And the cap of estate was taken from the
Duke's head before he came down stairs. When the execution was over, it
is said that one of the Council of Ten went to the columns of the palace
over against the place of St. Mark, and that he showed the bloody sword
unto the people, crying out with a loud voice--"The terrible doom hath
fallen upon the traitor!"--and the doors were opened, and the people all
rushed in, to see the corpse of the Duke, who had been beheaded.

It must be known that Ser Giovanni Sanudo, the councillor, was not
present when the aforesaid sentence was pronounced; because he was
unwell and remained at home. So that only fourteen balloted; that is to
say, five councillors, and nine of the Council of Ten. And it was
adjudged, that all the lands and chattels of the Duke, as well as of the
other traitors, should be forfeited to the state. And as a grace to the
Duke, it was resolved in the Council of Ten, that he should be allowed
to dispose of two thousand ducats out of his own property. And it was
resolved, that all the councillors and all the Avogadori of the
Commonwealth, those of the Council of Ten, and the members of the junta,
who had assisted in passing sentence on the Duke and the other traitors,
should have the privilege of carrying arms both by day and by night in
Venice, and from Grado to Cavazere. And they were also to be allowed two
footmen carrying arms, the aforesaid footmen living and boarding with
them in their own houses. And he who did not keep two footmen might
transfer the privilege to his sons or his brothers; but only to two.
Permission of carrying arms was also granted to the four Notaries of the
Chancery, that is to say, of the Supreme Court, who took the
depositions; and they were, Amedio, Nicoletto di Lorino, Steffanello,
and Pietro de Compostelli, the secretaries of the Signori di Notte.

After the traitors had been hanged, and the Duke had had his head cut
off, the state remained in great tranquillity and peace. And, as I have
read in a Chronicle, the corpse of the Duke was removed in a barge, with
eight torches, to his tomb in the church of San Giovanni e Paolo, where
it was buried. The tomb is now in that aisle in the middle of the little
church of Santa Maria della Pace which was built by Bishop Gabriel of
Bergamo. It is a coffin of stone, with these words engraven thereon:
"_Heic jacet Dominus Marinus Faletro Dux._"--And they did not paint his
portrait in the hall of the Great Council:--but in the place where it
ought to have been, you see these words:--"_Hic est locus Marini
Faletro, decapitati pro criminibus._"--And it is thought that his house
was granted to the church of Sant' Apostolo; it was that great one near
the bridge. Yet this could not be the case, or else the family bought it
back from the church; for it still belongs to Cà Faliero. I must not
refrain from noting, that some wished to write the following words in
the place where his portrait ought to have been, as
aforesaid:--"_Marinus Faletro Dux, temeritas me cepit. Pænas lui,
decapitatus pro criminibus._"--Others, also, indited a couplet, worthy
of being inscribed upon his tomb.

    "_Dux Venetum jacet heic, patriam qui prodere tentans,_
           _Sceptra, decus, censum perdidit, atque caput._"

NOTE B.

Petrarch on the Conspiracy of Marino Faliero.[485]

"Al giovane doge Andrea Dandolo succedette un vecchio, il quale tardi si
pose al timone della repubblica, ma sempre prima di quel, che facea d'
uopo a lui ed alia patria: egli è Marino Faliero, personaggio a me noto
per antica dimestichezza. Falsa era l' opinione intorno a lui, giacchè
egli si mostrò fornito più di coraggio, che di senno. Non pago della
prima dignità, entrò con sinistro piede nel pubblico Palazzo:
imperciocchè questo doge dei Veneti, magistrato sacro in tutti i secoli,
che dagli antichi fu sempre venerato qual nume in quella città, l'
altr'jeri fu decollato nel vestibolo dell' istesso Palazzo. Discorrerei
fin dal principio le cause di un tale evento, se cosi vario, ed ambiguo
non ne fosse il grido: nessuno però lo scusa, tutti affermano, che egli
abbia voluto cangiar qualche cosa nell' ordine della repubblica a lui
tramandato dai maggiori. Che desiderava egli di più? Io son d' avviso,
che egli abbia ottenuto ciò, che non si concedette a nessun altro:
mentre adempiva gli uffici di legato presso il Pontefice, e sulle rive
del Rodano trattava la pace, che io prima di lui avevo indarno tentato
di conchiudere, gli fu conferito l' onore del ducato, che nè chiedeva,
nè s' aspettava. Tornato in patria, pensò a quello, cui nessuno non pose
mente giammai, e soffrì quello, che a niuno accadde mai di soffrire:
giacchè in quel luogo celeberrimo, e chiarissimo, e bellissimo infra
tutti quelli, che io vidi, ove i suoi antenati avevano ricevuti
grandissimi onori in mezzo alle pompe trionfali, ivi egli fu trascinato
in modo servile, e spogliato delle insegne ducali, perdette la testa, e
macchiò col proprio sangue le soglie del tempio, l' atrio del Palazzo, e
le scale marmoree endute spesse volte illustri o dalle solenni
festività, o dalle ostili spoglie. Ho notato il luogo, ora noto il
tempo: è l' anno del Natale di Cristo, 1355, fu il giorno diciotto
aprile si alto è il grido sparso, che se alcuno esaminerà la disciplina,
e le costumanze di quella città, e quanto mutamento di cose venga
minacciato dalla morte di un solo uomo (quantunque molti altri, come
narrano, essendo complici, o subirono l' istesso supplicio, o lo
aspettano) si accorgerà, che nulla di più grande avvenne ai nostri tempi
nella Italia. Tu forse qui attendi il mio giudizio: assolvo il popolo,
se credere si dee alia fama, benchè abbia potuto e castigate più
mitemente, e con maggior dolcezza vendicare il suo dolore: ma non cosi
facilmente, si modera un' ira giusta insieme, e grande in un numeroso
popolo principalmente, nel quale il precipitoso, ed instabile volgo
aguzza gli stimoli dell' iracondia con rapidi, e sconsigliati clamori.
Compatisco, e nell' istesso tempo mi adiro con quell' infelice uomo, il
quale adorno di un' insolito onore, non so, che cosa si volesse negli
estremi anni della sua vita: la calamità di lui diviene sempre più
grave, perchè dalla sentenza contra di esso promulgata apparirà, che
egli fu non solo misero, ma insano, e demente, e che con vane arti si
usurpò per tanti anni una falsa fama di sapienza. Ammonisco i dogi, i
quali gli succederanno, che questo e un' esempio posto innanzi ai loro
occhi, quale specchio, nel quale veggano d' essere non signori, ma duci,
anzi nemmeno duci, ma onorati servi della Repubblica. Tu sta sano; e
giacchè fluttuano le pubbliche cose, sforziamoci di governar
modestissimamente i privati nostri affari."--_Viaggi di Francesco
Petrarca_, descritti dal Professore Ambrogio Levati, Milano, 1820, iv.
323-325.

The above Italian translation from the Latin epistles of Petrarch
proves--1stly, That Marino Faliero was a personal friend of Petrarch's;
"antica dimestichezza," old intimacy, is the phrase of the poet. 2dly,
That Petrarch thought that he had more courage than conduct, "più di
_coraggio_ che di senno." 3dly, That there was some jealousy on the part
of Petrarch; for he says that Marino Faliero was treating of the peace
which he himself had "vainly attempted to conclude." 4thly, That the
honour of the Dukedom was conferred upon him, which he neither sought
nor expected, "che nè chiedeva, nè aspettava," and which had never been
granted to any other in like circumstances, "ciò che non si concedette a
nessun altro," a proof of the high esteem in which he must have been
held. 5thly, That he had a reputation for _wisdom_, _only_ forfeited by
the last enterprise of his life, "si usurpò per tanti anni una falsa
fama di sapienza."--"He had usurped for so many years a false fame of
wisdom," rather a difficult task, I should think. People are generally
found out before eighty years of age, at least in a republic.--From
these, and the other historical notes which I have collected, it may be
inferred, that Marino Faliero possessed many of the qualities, but not
the success of a hero; and that his passions were too violent. The
paltry and ignorant account of Dr. Moore falls to the ground. Petrarch
says, "that there had been no greater event in his times" (_our times_
literally), "nostri tempi," in Italy. He also differs from the historian
in saying that Faliero was "on the banks of the _Rhone_," instead of at
Rome, when elected; the other accounts say, that the deputation of the
Venetian senate met him at Ravenna. How this may have been, it is not
for me to decide, and is of no great importance. Had the man succeeded,
he would have changed the face of Venice, and perhaps of Italy. As it
is, what _are_ they both?

Venetian Society and Manners.

    "Vice without splendour, sin without relief
    Even from the gloss of love to smooth it o'er;
    But in its stead, coarse lusts of habitude," etc.

"To these attacks so frequently pointed by the government against the
clergy,--to the continual struggles between the different constituted
bodies,--to these enterprises carried on by the mass of the nobles
against the depositaries of power,--to all those projects of innovation,
which always ended by a stroke of state policy; we must add a cause not
less fitted to spread contempt for ancient doctrines; _this was the
excess of corruption_.

"That freedom of manners, which had been long boasted of as the
principal charm of Venetian society, had degenerated into scandalous
licentiousness: the tie of marriage was less sacred in that Catholic
country, than among those nations where the laws and religion admit of
its being dissolved. Because they could not break the contract, they
feigned that it had not existed; and the ground of nullity, immodestly
alleged by the married pair, was admitted with equal facility by priests
and magistrates, alike corrupt. These divorces, veiled under another
name, became so frequent, that the most important act of civil society
was discovered to be amenable to a tribunal of exceptions; and to
restrain the open scandal of such proceedings became the office of the
police. In 1782 the Council of Ten decreed, that every woman who should
sue for a dissolution of her marriage should be compelled to await the
decision of the judges in some convent, to be named by the court.[486]
Soon afterwards the same council summoned all causes of that nature
before itself.[487] This infringement on ecclesiastical jurisdiction
having occasioned some remonstrance from Rome, the council retained only
the right of rejecting the petition of the married persons, and
consented to refer such causes to the holy office as it should not
previously have rejected.[488]

"There was a moment in which, doubtless, the destruction of private
fortunes, the ruin of youth, the domestic discord occasioned by these
abuses, determined the government to depart from its established maxims
concerning the freedom of manners allowed the subject. All the
courtesans were banished from Venice; but their absence was not enough
to reclaim and bring back good morals to a whole people brought up in
the most scandalous licentiousness. Depravity reached the very bosoms of
private families, and even into the cloister; and they found themselves
obliged to recall, and even to indemnify,[489] women who sometimes
gained possession of important secrets, and who might be usefully
employed in the ruin of men whose fortunes might have rendered them
dangerous. Since that time licentiousness has gone on increasing; and we
have seen mothers, not only selling the innocence of their daughters,
but selling it by a contract, authenticated by the signature of a public
officer, and the performance of which was secured by the protection of
the laws.[490]

"The parlours of the convents of noble ladies, and the houses of the
courtesans, though the police carefully kept up a number of spies about
them, were the only assemblies for society in Venice; and in these two
places, so different from each other, there was equal freedom. Music,
collations, gallantry, were not more forbidden in the parlours than at
the casinos. There were a number of casinos for the purpose of public
assemblies, where gaming was the principal pursuit of the company. It
was a strange sight to see persons of either sex masked, or grave in
their magisterial robes, round a table, invoking chance, and giving way
at one instant to the agonies of despair, at the next to the illusions
of hope, and that without uttering a single word.

"The rich had private casinos, but they lived _incognito_ in them; and
the wives whom they abandoned found compensation in the liberty they
enjoyed. The corruption of morals had deprived them of their empire. We
have just reviewed the whole history of Venice, and we have not once
seen them exercise the slightest influence."--Daru, _Hist. de la Répub.
de Vénise_, Paris, 1821, v. 328-332.

The author of "Sketches Descriptive of Italy," (1820), etc., one of the
hundred tours lately published, is extremely anxious to disclaim a
possible plagiarism from _Childe Harold_ and _Beppo_. See p. 159, vol.
iv. He adds that still less could this presumed coincidence arise from
"my conversation," as he had "_repeatedly declined an introduction to me
while in Italy_."

Who this person may be I know not;[491] but he must have been deceived
by all or any of those who "repeatedly offered to introduce" him, as I
invariably refused to receive any English with whom I was not previously
acquainted, even when they had letters from England. If the whole
assertion is not an invention, I request this person not to sit down
with the notion that he could have been introduced, since there has been
nothing I have so carefully avoided as any kind of intercourse with his
countrymen,--excepting the very few who were for a considerable time
resident in Venice, or had been of my previous acquaintance. Whoever
made him any such offer was possessed of impudence equal to that of
making such an assertion without having had it. The fact is, that I hold
in utter abhorrence any contact with the travelling English, as my
friend the Consul General Hoppner and the Countess Benzoni (in whose
house the Conversazione mostly frequented by them is held), could amply
testify, were it worth while. I was persecuted by these tourists even to
my riding ground at Lido, and reduced to the most disagreeable circuits
to avoid them. At Madame Benzoni's I repeatedly refused to be introduced
to them;--of a thousand such presentations pressed upon me, I accepted
two, and both were to Irish women.

       *       *       *       *       *

I should hardly have descended to speak of such trifles publicly, if the
impudence of this "sketcher" had not forced me to a refutation of a
disingenuous and gratuitously impertinent assertion; so meant to be, for
what could it import to the reader to be told that the author "had
repeatedly declined an introduction," even if it had been true, which,
for the reasons I have above given, is scarcely possible. Except Lords
Lansdowne, Jersey, and Lauderdale, Messrs. Scott, Hammond, Sir Humphry
Davy, the late M. Lewis, W. Bankes, Mr. Hoppner, Thomas Moore, Lord
Kinnaird, his brother, Mr. Joy, and Mr. Hobhouse, I do not recollect to
have exchanged a word with another Englishman since I left their
Country; and almost all these I had known before. The others,--and God
knows there were some hundreds, who bored me with letters or visits, I
refused to have any communication with, and shall be proud and happy
when that wish becomes mutual.

                INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.


Byron's _Vision of Judgment_ is a parody of Southey's _Vision of
Judgement_.

The acts or fyttes of the quarrel between Byron and Southey occur in the
following order. In the summer of 1817 Southey, accompanied by his
friends, Humphrey Senhouse and the artist Edward Nash, passed some weeks
(July) in Switzerland. They visited Chamouni, and at Montanvert, in the
travellers' album, they found, in Shelley's handwriting, a Greek
hexameter verse, in which he affirmed that he was an "atheist," together
with an indignant comment ("fool!" also in Greek) superadded in an
unknown hand (see _Life of Shelley_, by E. Dowden, 1886, ii. 30, note).
Southey copied this entry into his note-book, and "spoke of the
circumstance on his return" (circ. August 12, 1817). In the course of
the next year some one told Byron that a rumour had reached England that
he and Shelley "had formed a league of incest with two sisters," and
that Southey and Coleridge were the authors of the scandal. There is
nothing to show through what channel the report of the rumour reached
Byron's ears, but it may be inferred that it was in his mind (see Letter
to Murray, November 24, 1818, _Letters_, 1900, iv. 272) when he assailed
Southey in the "Dedication" ("in good, simple, savage verse") to the
First Canto of _Don Juan_, which was begun September 6, 1818. Shelley,
who was already embittered against Southey (see the account of a dinner
at Godwin's, November 6, 1817, _Diary of H. C. Robinson_, 1869, ii. 67),
heard Byron read this "Dedication," and, in a letter to Peacock (October
8, 1818), describes it as being "more like a mixture of wormwood and
verdigrease than satire."

When _Don Juan_ appeared (July 15, 1819), the "Dedication" was not
forthcoming, but of its existence and character Southey had been
informed. "Have you heard," he asks (Letter to the Rev. H. Hill,
_Selections from the Letters, etc._, 1856, iii. 142), "that _Don Juan_
came over with a Dedication to me, in which Lord Castlereagh and I ...
were coupled together for abuse as the 'two Roberts'? A fear of
persecution (_sic_) from the _one_ Robert is supposed to be the reason
why it has been suppressed. Lord Byron might have done well to remember
that the other can write dedications also; and make his own cause good,
if it were needful, in prose or rhyme, against a villain, as well as
against a slanderer."

When George III. died (January 29, 1820), it became the duty of the
"laurel-honouring laureate" to write a funeral ode, and in composing a
Preface, in vindication of the English hexameter, he took occasion
"incidentally to repay some of his obligations to Lord Byron by a few
comments on _Don Juan_" (Letter to the Rev. H. Hill, January 8, 1821,
_Selections, etc._, iii. 225). He was, no doubt, impelled by other and
higher motives to constitute himself a _censor morum_, and take up his
parable against the spirit of the age as displayed and fostered in _Don
Juan_ (see a letter to Wynne, March 23, 1821, _Selections, etc._, iii.
238), but the suppressed "Dedication" and certain gibes, which had been
suffered to appear, may be reckoned as the immediate causes of his
anathema.

Southey's _Vision of Judgement_ was published April 11, 1821--an
undivine comedy, in which the apotheosis of George III., the
beatification of the virtuous, and the bale and damnation of such
egregious spirits as Robespierre, Wilkes, and Junius, are "thrown upon
the screen" of the showman or lecturer. Southey said that the "Vision"
ought to be read aloud, and, if the subject could be forgotten and
ignored, the hexameters might not sound amiss, but the subject and its
treatment are impossible and intolerable. The "Vision" would have "made
sport" for Byron in any case, but, in the Preface, Southey went out of
his way to attack and denounce the anonymous author of _Don Juan_.

"What, then," he asks (ed. 1838, x. 204), "should be said of those for
whom the thoughtlessness and inebriety of wanton youth can no longer be
pleaded, but who have written in sober manhood, and with deliberate
purpose?... Men of diseased hearts and depraved imaginations, who,
forming a system of opinions to suit their own unhappy course of
conduct, have rebelled against the holiest ordinances of human society,
and hating that revealed religion which, with all their efforts and
bravadoes, they are unable entirely to disbelieve, labour to make others
as miserable as themselves, by infecting them with a moral virus that
eats into the soul! The school which they have set up may properly be
called the Satanic school; for, though their productions breathe the
spirit of Belial in their lascivious parts, and the spirit of Moloch in
those loathsome images of atrocities and horrors which they delight to
represent, they are more especially characterized by a Satanic pride and
audacious impiety, which still betrays the wretched feeling of
hopelessness wherewith it is allied."

Byron was not slow to take up the challenge. In the "Appendix" to the
_Two Foscari_ (first ed., pp. 325-329), which was written at Ravenna,
June-July, but not published till December 11, 1821, he retaliates on
"Mr. Southey and his 'pious preface'" in many words; but when it comes
to the point, ignores the charge of having "published a lascivious
book," and endeavours by counter-charges to divert the odium and to
cover his adversary with shame and confusion. "Mr. S.," he says, "with a
cowardly ferocity, exults over the anticipated 'death-bed repentance' of
the objects of his dislike; and indulges himself in a pleasant 'Vision
of Judgment,' in prose as well as verse, full of impious impudence.... I
am not ignorant," he adds, "of Mr. Southey's calumnies on a different
occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad on his
return from Switzerland against me and others.... What _his_ 'death-bed'
may be it is not my province to predicate; let him settle it with his
Maker, as I must do with mine. There is something at once ludicrous and
blasphemous in this arrogant scribbler of all works sitting down to deal
damnation and destruction upon his fellow-creatures, with Wat Tyler, the
Apotheosis of George the Third, and the Elegy on Martin the regicide,
all shuffled together in his writing-desk."

Southey must have received his copy of the _Two Foscari_ in the last
week of December, 1821, and with the "Appendix" (to say nothing of the
Third Canto of _Don Juan_) before him, he gave tongue, in the pages of
the _Courier_, January 6, 1822. His task was an easy one. He was able to
deny, _in toto_, the charge of uttering calumnies on his return from
Switzerland, and he was pleased to word his denial in a very
disagreeable way. He had come home with a stock of travellers' tales,
but not one of them was about Lord Byron. He had "sought for no staler
subject than St. Ursula." His charges of "impiety," "lewdness,"
"profanation," and "pollution," had not been answered, and were
unanswerable; and as to his being a "scribbler of all work," there were
exceptions--works which he had _not_ scribbled, the _nefanda_ which
disfigured the writings of Lord Byron. "Satanic school" would stick.

So far, the battle went in Southey's favour. "The words of the men of
Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel," and Byron was
reduced to silence. A challenge (sent through Kinnaird, but not
delivered) was but a confession of impotence. There was, however, in
Southey's letter to the _Courier_ just one sentence too many. Before he
concluded he had given "one word of advice to Lord Byron"--"When he
attacks me again, let it be in rhyme. For one who has so little command
of himself, it will be a great advantage that his temper should be
obliged to _keep tune_."

Byron had anticipated this advice, and had already attacked the laureate
in rhyme, scornfully and satirically, but with a gay and genial mockery
which dispensed with "wormwood and verdigrease" or yet bitterer and more
venomous ingredients.

There was a truth in Lamb's jest, that it was Southey's _Vision of
Judgement_ which was worthy of prosecution; that "Lord Byron's poem was
of a most good-natured description--no malevolence" (_Diary of H. C.
Robinson_, 1869, ii. 240). Good-natured or otherwise, it awoke
inextinguishable laughter, and left Byron in possession of the field.

The _Vision of Judgment_, begun May 7 (but probably laid aside till
September 11), was forwarded to Murray October 4, 1821. "By this post,"
he wrote to Moore, October 6, 1821 (_Letters_, 1901, v. 387), "I have
sent my nightmare to balance the incubus of Southey's impudent
anticipation of the Apotheosis of George the Third." A chance perusal of
Southey's letter in the _Courier_ (see Medwin's _Conversations_, 1824,
p. 222, and letters to Douglas Kinnaird, February 6, 25, 1822) quickened
his desire for publication; but in spite of many appeals and suggestions
to Murray, who had sent Byron's "copy" to his printer, the decisive step
of passing the proofs for press was never taken. At length Byron lost
patience, and desired Murray to hand over "the corrected copy of the
proof with the Preface" of the _Vision of Judgment_ to John Hunt (see
letters to Murray, July 3, 6, 1822, _Letters_, 1901, vi. 92, 93).
Finally, a year after the MS. had been sent to England, the _Vision of
Judgment_, by Quevedo Redivivus, appeared in the first number (pp. 1-39)
of the _Liberal_, which was issued October 15, 1822. The Preface, to
Byron's astonishment and annoyance, was not forthcoming (see letter to
Murray, October 22, 1822, _Letters_, 1901, vi. 126, and _Examiner_,
Sunday, November 3, 1822, p. 697), and is not prefixed to the first
issue of the _Vision of Judgment_ in the first number of the _Liberal_.

The _Liberal_ was severely handled by the press (see, for example, the
_Literary Gazette_ for October 19, 26, November 2, 1822; see, too, an
anonymous pamphlet entitled _A Critique on the "Liberal"_ (London,
1822, 8vo, 16 pages), which devotes ten pages to an attack on the
_Vision of Judgment_). The daily press was even more violent. The
_Courier_ for October 26 begins thus: "This _scoundrel-like_ publication
has at length made its appearance."

There was even a threat of prosecution. Byron offered to employ counsel
for Hunt, to come over to England to stand his trial in his stead, and
blamed Murray for not having handed over the corrected proof, in which
some of the more offensive passages had been omitted or mitigated (see
letter to Murray, December 25, 1822, and letter to John Hunt, January 8,
1823, _Letters,_ 1901, vi. 155, 159). It is to be noted that in the list
of _Errata_ affixed to the table of Contents at the end of the first
volume of the _Liberal,_ the words, a "weaker king ne'er," are
substituted for "a worse king never" (stanza viii. line 6), and "an
unhandsome woman" for "a bad, ugly woman" (stanza xii. line 8). It would
seem that these emendations, which do not appear in the MS., were
slipped into the _Errata_ as precautions, not as after-thoughts.

Nevertheless, it was held that a publication "calumniating the late
king, and wounding the feelings of his present Majesty," was a danger to
the public peace, and on January 15, 1824, the case of the King _v._
John Hunt was tried in the Court of King's Bench. The jury brought in a
verdict of "Guilty," but judgment was deferred, and it was not till July
19, 1824, three days after the author of the _Vision of Judgment_ had
been laid to rest at Hucknall Torkard, that the publisher was sentenced
to pay to the king a fine of one hundred pounds, and to enter into
securities, for five years, for a larger amount.

NOTE.

The following excerpt from H. C. Robinson's _Diary_ is printed from the
original MS., with the kind permission of the trustees of Dr. Williams'
Theological Library (see "Diary," 1869, ii. 437):--

     "[Weimar], August 15, [1829].

     "W[ordsworth] will not put the nose of B[yron] out with Frau von
     Goethe, but he will be appreciated by her. I am afraid of the
     experiment with the great poet himself....

     " ... I alone to the poet....

     "I read to him the _Vision of Judgment_. He enjoyed it like a
     child; but his criticisms went little beyond the exclamatory 'Toll!
     Ganz grob! himmlisch! unübertrefflich!' etc., etc.

     "In general, the more strongly peppered passages pleased him the
     best. Stanza 9 he praised for the clear distinct painting; 10 he
     repeated with emphasis,--the last two lines conscious that his own
     age was eighty; 13, 14, and 15 are favourites with me. G. concurred
     in the suggested praise. The stanza 24 he declared to be sublime.
     The characteristic speeches of Wilkes and Junius he thought most
     admirable.

     "Byron 'hat selbst viel übertroffen;' and the introduction of
     Southey made him laugh heartily.

                                 PREFACE

It hath been wisely said, that "One fool makes many;" and it hath been
poetically observed--

    "[That] fools rush in where angels fear to tread."

                                  [POPE'S _Essay on Criticism_, line 625.]

If Mr. Southey had not rushed in where he had no business, and where he
never was before, and never will be again, the following poem would not
have been written. It is not impossible that it may be as good as his
own, seeing that it cannot, by any species of stupidity, natural or
acquired, be _worse._ The gross flattery, the dull impudence, the
renegade intolerance, and impious cant, of the poem by the author of
"Wat Tyler," are something so stupendous as to form the sublime of
himself--containing the quintessence of his own attributes.

So much for his poem--a word on his preface. In this preface it has
pleased the magnanimous Laureate to draw the picture of a supposed
"Satanic School," the which he doth recommend to the notice of the
legislature; thereby adding to his other laurels the ambition of those
of an informer. If there exists anywhere, except in his imagination,
such a School, is he not sufficiently armed against it by his own
intense vanity? The truth is that there are certain writers whom Mr. S.
imagines, like Scrub, to have "talked of _him_; for they laughed
consumedly."[492]

I think I know enough of most of the writers to whom he is supposed to
allude, to assert, that they, in their individual capacities, have done
more good, in the charities of life, to their fellow-creatures, in any
one year, than Mr. Southey has done harm to himself by his absurdities
in his whole life; and this is saying a great deal. But I have a few
questions to ask.

1stly, Is Mr. Southey the author of _Wat Tyler_?

2ndly, Was he not refused a remedy at law by the highest judge of his
beloved England, because it was a blasphemous and seditious
publication?[493]

3rdly, Was he not entitled by William Smith, in full parliament, "a
rancorous renegado?"[494]

4thly, Is he not poet laureate, with his own lines on Martin the
regicide staring him in the face?[495]

And, 5thly, Putting the four preceding items together, with what
conscience dare _he_ call the attention of the laws to the publications
of others, be they what they may?

I say nothing of the cowardice of such a proceeding; its meanness speaks
for itself; but I wish to touch upon the _motive_, which is neither more
nor less than that Mr. S. has been laughed at a little in some recent
publications, as he was of yore in the _Anti-jacobin_, by his present
patrons. Hence all this "skimble scamble stuff" about "Satanic," and so
forth. However, it is worthy of him--"_qualis ab incepto_."

If there is anything obnoxious to the political opinions of a portion of
the public in the following poem, they may thank Mr. Southey. He might
have written hexameters, as he has written everything else, for aught
that the writer cared--had they been upon another subject. But to
attempt to canonise a monarch, who, whatever were his household virtues,
was neither a successful nor a patriot king,--inasmuch as several years
of his reign passed in war with America and Ireland, to say nothing of
the aggression upon France--like all other exaggeration, necessarily
begets opposition. In whatever manner he may be spoken of in this new
_Vision_, his _public_ career will not be more favourably transmitted by
history. Of his private virtues (although a little expensive to the
nation) there can be no doubt.

With regard to the supernatural personages treated of, I can only say
that I know as much about them, and (as an honest man) have a better
right to talk of them than Robert Southey. I have also treated them more
tolerantly. The way in which that poor insane creature, the Laureate,
deals about his judgments in the next world, is like his own judgment in
this. If it was not completely ludicrous, it would be something worse. I
don't think that there is much more to say at present.

                                                        QUEVEDO REDIVIVUS.

P.S.--It is possible that some readers may object, in these
objectionable times, to the freedom with which saints, angels, and
spiritual persons discourse in this _Vision_. But, for precedents upon
such points, I must refer him to Fielding's _Journey from this World to
the next_, and to the Visions of myself, the said Quevedo, in Spanish
or translated.[496] The reader is also requested to observe, that no
doctrinal tenets are insisted upon or discussed; that the person of the
Deity is carefully withheld from sight, which is more than can be said
for the Laureate, who hath thought proper to make him talk, not "like a
school-divine,"[497] but like the unscholarlike Mr. Southey. The whole
action passes on the outside of heaven; and Chaucer's _Wife of Bath_,
Pulci's _Morgante Maggiore_, Swift's _Tale of a Tub_, and the other
works above referred to, are cases in point of the freedom with which
saints, etc., may be permitted to converse in works not intended to be
serious.

                                                                      Q.R.

* * * Mr. Southey being, as he says, a good Christian and vindictive,
threatens, I understand, a reply to this our answer. It is to be hoped
that his visionary faculties will in the meantime have acquired a little
more judgment, properly so called: otherwise he will get himself into
new dilemmas. These apostate jacobins furnish rich rejoinders. Let him
take a specimen. Mr. Southey laudeth grievously "one Mr. Landor,"[498]
who cultivates much private renown in the shape of Latin verses; and
not long ago, the poet laureate dedicated to him, it appeareth, one of
his fugitive lyrics, upon the strength of a poem called "_Gebir_." Who
could suppose, that in this same Gebir the aforesaid Savage Landor (for
such is his grim cognomen) putteth into the infernal regions no less a
person than the hero of his friend Mr. Southey's heaven,--yea, even
George the Third! See also how personal Savage becometh, when he hath a
mind. The following is his portrait of our late gracious sovereign:--

     (Prince Gebir having descended into the infernal regions, the
     shades of his royal ancestors are, at his request, called up to his
     view; and he exclaims to his ghostly  guide)--

    "'Aroar, what wretch that nearest us? what wretch
    Is that with eyebrows white and slanting brow?
    Listen! him yonder who, bound down supine,
    Shrinks yelling from that sword there, engine-hung;
    He too amongst my ancestors! [I hate
    The despot, but the dastard I despise.
    Was he our countryman?'
                            'Alas,][499] O king!
    Iberia bore him, but the breed accurst
    Inclement winds blew blighting from north-east.'
    'He was a warrior then, nor fear'd the gods?'
    'Gebir, he feared the Demons, not the gods,
    Though them indeed his daily face adored;
    And was no warrior, yet the thousand lives
    Squandered, as stones to exercise a sling,
    And the tame cruelty and cold caprice--
      Oh madness of mankind! addressed, adored!'"

                                   _Gebir_ [_Works, etc._, 1876, vii. 17].

I omit noticing some edifying Ithyphallics of Savagius, wishing to keep
the proper veil over them, if his grave but somewhat indiscreet
worshipper will suffer it; but certainly these teachers of "great moral
lessons" are apt to be found in strange company.




                       THE VISION OF JUDGMENT.[500]

                        I.

    Saint Peter sat by the celestial gate:
      His keys were rusty, and the lock was dull,
    So little trouble had been given of late;
      Not that the place by any means was full,
    But since the Gallic era "eighty-eight"
      The Devils had ta'en a longer, stronger pull,
    And "a pull altogether," as they say
    At sea--which drew most souls another way.

                        II.

    The Angels all were singing out of tune,
      And hoarse with having little else to do,
    Excepting to wind up the sun and moon,
      Or curb a runaway young star or two,[fz]
    Or wild colt of a comet, which too soon
      Broke out of bounds o'er the ethereal blue,
    Splitting some planet with its playful tail,
    As boats are sometimes by a wanton whale.

                        III.

    The Guardian Seraphs had retired on high,
      Finding their charges past all care below;[ga]
    Terrestrial business filled nought in the sky
      Save the Recording Angel's black bureau;
    Who found, indeed, the facts to multiply
      With such rapidity of vice and woe,
    That he had stripped off both his wings in quills,
    And yet was in arrear of human ills.

                        IV.

    His business so augmented of late years,
      That he was forced, against his will, no doubt,
    (Just like those cherubs, earthly ministers,)
      For some resource to turn himself about,
    And claim the help of his celestial peers,[gb]
      To aid him ere he should be quite worn out
    By the increased demand for his remarks:[gc]
    Six Angels and twelve Saints were named his clerks.

                        V.

    This was a handsome board--at least for Heaven;
      And yet they had even then enough to do,
    So many Conquerors' cars were daily driven,
      So many kingdoms fitted up anew;
    Each day, too, slew its thousands six or seven,
      Till at the crowning carnage, Waterloo,
    They threw their pens down in divine disgust--
    The page was so besmeared with blood and dust.[gd]

                        VI.

    This by the way; 'tis not mine to record
      What Angels shrink from: even the very Devil
    On this occasion his own work abhorred,
      So surfeited with the infernal revel:
    Though he himself had sharpened every sword,[ge]
      It almost quenched his innate thirst of evil.
    (Here Satan's sole good work deserves insertion--
    'Tis, that he has both Generals in reversion.)[gf][501]

                        VII.

    Let's skip a few short years of hollow peace,
      Which peopled earth no better, Hell as wont,
    And Heaven none--they form the tyrant's lease,
      With nothing but new names subscribed upon't;
    'Twill one day finish: meantime they increase,[gg]
      "With seven heads and ten horns," and all in front,
    Like Saint John's foretold beast; but ours are born
    Less formidable in the head than horn.[gh]

                        VIII.

    In the first year of Freedom's second dawn[502]
      Died George the Third; although no tyrant, one
    Who shielded tyrants, till each sense withdrawn[gi]
      Left him nor mental nor external sun:[503]
    A better farmer ne'er brushed dew from lawn,[gj]
      A worse king never left a realm undone!
    He died--but left his subjects still behind,
    One half as mad--and t'other no less blind.[gk][504]

                        IX.

    He died! his death made no great stir on earth:
      His burial made some pomp; there was profusion
    Of velvet--gilding--brass--and no great dearth
      Of aught but tears--save those shed by collusion:
    For these things may be bought at their true worth;
      Of elegy there was the due infusion--
    Bought also; and the torches, cloaks and banners,
    Heralds, and relics of old Gothic manners,[505]

                        X.

    Formed a sepulchral melodrame. Of all
      The fools who flocked to swell or see the show,
    Who cared about the corpse? The funeral
      Made the attraction, and the black the woe,
    There throbbed not there a thought which pierced the pall;
      And when the gorgeous coffin was laid low,
    It seemed the mockery of hell to fold
    The rottenness of eighty years in gold.[506]


                        XI.

    So mix his body with the dust! It might
      Return to what it _must_ far sooner, were
    The natural compound left alone to fight
      Its way back into earth, and fire, and air;
    But the unnatural balsams merely blight
      What Nature made him at his birth, as bare
    As the mere million's base unmummied clay--
    Yet all his spices but prolong decay.[507]

                        XII.

    He's dead--and upper earth with him has done;
      He's buried; save the undertaker's bill,
    Or lapidary scrawl, the world is gone
      For him, unless he left a German will:[508]
    But where's the proctor who will ask his son?
      In whom his qualities are reigning still,[gl]
    Except that household virtue, most uncommon,
    Of constancy to a bad, ugly woman.

                        XIII.

    "God save the king!" It is a large economy
      In God to save the like; but if he will
    Be saving, all the better; for not one am I
      Of those who think damnation better still:[509]
    I hardly know too if not quite alone am I
      In this small hope of bettering future ill
    By circumscribing, with some slight restriction,
    The eternity of Hell's hot jurisdiction.

                        XIV.

    I know this is unpopular; I know
      'Tis blasphemous; I know one may be damned
    For hoping no one else may e'er be so;
      I know my catechism; I know we're crammed
    With the best doctrines till we quite o'erflow;
      I know that all save England's Church have shammed,
    And that the other twice two hundred churches
    And synagogues have made a _damned_ bad purchase.

                        XV.

    God help us all! God help me too! I am,
      God knows, as helpless as the Devil can wish,
    And not a whit more difficult to damn,
      Than is to bring to land a late-hooked fish,
    Or to the butcher to purvey the lamb;
      Not that I'm fit for such a noble dish,
    As one day will be that immortal fry
    Of almost every body born to die.

                        XVI.

    Saint Peter sat by the celestial gate,
      And nodded o'er his keys: when, lo! there came
    A wondrous noise he had not heard of late--
      A rushing sound of wind, and stream, and flame;
    In short, a roar of things extremely great,
      Which would have made aught save a Saint exclaim;
    But he, with first a start and then a wink,
    Said, "There's another star gone out, I think!"[gm]

                        XVII.

    But ere he could return to his repose,
      A Cherub flapped his right wing o'er his eyes--
    At which Saint Peter yawned, and rubbed his nose:
      "Saint porter," said the angel, "prithee rise!"
    Waving a goodly wing, which glowed, as glows
      An earthly peacock's tail, with heavenly dyes:
    To which the saint replied, "Well, what's the matter?
    "Is Lucifer come back with all this clatter?"

                        XVIII.

    "No," quoth the Cherub: "George the Third is dead."
      "And who _is_ George the Third?" replied the apostle:
    "_What George? what Third?_" "The King of England," said
      The angel. "Well! he won't find kings to jostle
    Him on his way; but does he wear his head?
      Because the last we saw here had a tustle,
    And ne'er would have got into Heaven's good graces,
    Had he not flung his head in all our faces.

                        XIX.

    "He was--if I remember--King of France;[510]
      That head of his, which could not keep a crown
    On earth, yet ventured in my face to advance
      A claim to those of martyrs--like my own:
    If I had had my sword, as I had once
      When I cut ears off, I had cut him down;
    But having but my _keys_, and not my brand,
    I only knocked his head from out his hand.

                        XX.

    "And then he set up such a headless howl,
      That all the Saints came out and took him in;
    And there he sits by Saint Paul, cheek by jowl;[gn]
      That fellow Paul--the parvenù! The skin[511]
    Of Saint Bartholomew, which makes his cowl
      In heaven, and upon earth redeemed his sin,
    So as to make a martyr, never sped
    Better than did this weak and wooden head.

                        XXI.

    "But had it come up here upon its shoulders,
      There would have been a different tale to tell:
    The fellow-feeling in the Saint's beholders
      Seems to have acted on them like a spell;
    And so this very foolish head Heaven solders
      Back on its trunk: it may be very well,
    And seems the custom here to overthrow
    Whatever has been wisely done below."

                        XXII.

    The Angel answered, "Peter! do not pout:
      The King who comes has head and all entire,
    And never knew much what it was about--
      He did as doth the puppet--by its wire,
    And will be judged like all the rest, no doubt:
      My business and your own is not to inquire
    Into such matters, but to mind our cue--
    Which is to act as we are bid to do."

                        XXIII.

    While thus they spake, the angelic caravan,
      Arriving like a rush of mighty wind,
    Cleaving the fields of space, as doth the swan
      Some silver stream (say Ganges, Nile, or Inde,
    Or Thames, or Tweed), and midst them an old man
      With an old soul, and both extremely blind,
    Halted before the gate, and, in his shroud,
    Seated their fellow-traveller on a cloud.[512]

                        XXIV.

    But bringing up the rear of this bright host
      A Spirit of a different aspect waved
    His wings, like thunder-clouds above some coast
      Whose barren beach with frequent wrecks is paved;
    His brow was like the deep when tempest-tossed;
      Fierce and unfathomable thoughts engraved
    Eternal wrath on his immortal face,
    And _where_ he gazed a gloom pervaded space.

                        XXV.

    As he drew near, he gazed upon the gate
      Ne'er to be entered more by him or Sin,
    With such a glance of supernatural hate,
      As made Saint Peter wish himself within;
    He pottered[513] with his keys at a great rate,
      And sweated through his Apostolic skin:[go]
    Of course his perspiration was but ichor,
    Or some such other spiritual liquor.[gp]

                        XXVI.

    The very Cherubs huddled all together,
      Like birds when soars the falcon; and they felt
    A tingling to the tip of every feather,
      And formed a circle like Orion's belt
    Around their poor old charge; who scarce knew whither
      His guards had led him, though they gently dealt
    With royal Manes (for by many stories,
    And true, we learn the Angels all are Tories).

                        XXVII.

    As things were in this posture, the gate flew
      Asunder, and the flashing of its hinges
    Flung over space an universal hue
      Of many-coloured flame, until its tinges
    Reached even our speck of earth, and made a new
      Aurora borealis spread its fringes
    O'er the North Pole; the same seen, when ice-bound,
    By Captain Parry's crew, in "Melville's Sound."[gq][514]

                        XXVIII.

    And from the gate thrown open issued beaming
      A beautiful and mighty Thing of Light,[515]
    Radiant with glory, like a banner streaming
      Victorious from some world-o'erthrowing fight:
    My poor comparisons must needs be teeming
      With earthly likenesses, for here the night
    Of clay obscures our best conceptions, saving
    Johanna Southcote,[516] or Bob Southey raving.[517]

                        XXIX.

    'Twas the Archangel Michael: all men know
      The make of Angels and Archangels, since
    There's scarce a scribbler has not one to show,
      From the fiends' leader to the Angels' Prince.
    There also are some altar-pieces, though
      I really can't say that they much evince
    One's inner notions of immortal spirits;
    But let the connoisseurs explain _their_ merits.

                        XXX.

    Michael flew forth in glory and in good;
      A goodly work of him from whom all Glory
    And Good arise; the portal past--he stood;
      Before him the young Cherubs and Saints hoary--
    (I say _young_, begging to be understood
      By looks, not years; and should be very sorry
    To state, they were not older than St. Peter,
    But merely that they seemed a little sweeter).

                        XXXI.

    The Cherubs and the Saints bowed down before
      That arch-angelic Hierarch, the first
    Of Essences angelical who wore
      The aspect of a god; but this ne'er nursed
    Pride in his heavenly bosom, in whose core
      No thought, save for his Maker's service, durst
    Intrude, however glorified and high;
    He knew him but the Viceroy of the sky.

                        XXXII.

    He and the sombre, silent Spirit met--
      They knew each other both for good and ill;
    Such was their power, that neither could forget
      His former friend and future foe; but still
    There was a high, immortal, proud regret
      In either's eye, as if 'twere less their will
    Than destiny to make the eternal years
    Their date of war, and their "Champ Clos" the spheres.

                        XXXIII.

    But here they were in neutral space: we know
      From Job, that Satan hath the power to pay
    A heavenly visit thrice a-year or so;
      And that the "Sons of God," like those of clay,
    Must keep him company; and we might show
      From the same book, in how polite a way
    The dialogue is held between the Powers
    Of Good and Evil--but 'twould take up hours.

                        XXXIV.

    And this is not a theologic tract,[518]
      To prove with Hebrew and with Arabic,
    If Job be allegory or a fact,
      But a true narrative; and thus I pick
    From out the whole but such and such an act
      As sets aside the slightest thought of trick.
    'Tis every tittle true, beyond suspicion,
    And accurate as any other vision.


                        XXXV.

    The spirits were in neutral space, before
      The gate of Heaven; like eastern thresholds is[519]
    The place where Death's grand cause is argued o'er,
      And souls despatched to that world or to this;
    And therefore Michael and the other wore
      A civil aspect: though they did not kiss,
    Yet still between his Darkness and his Brightness
    There passed a mutual glance of great politeness.

                        XXXVI.

    The Archangel bowed, not like a modern beau,
      But with a graceful oriental bend,
    Pressing one radiant arm just where below[gr]
      The heart in good men is supposed to tend;
    He turned as to an equal, not too low,
      But kindly; Satan met his ancient friend[gs]
    With more hauteur, as might an old Castilian
    Poor Noble meet a mushroom rich civilian.

                        XXXVII.

    He merely bent his diabolic brow
      An instant; and then raising it, he stood
    In act to assert his right or wrong, and show
      Cause why King George by no means could or should
    Make out a case to be exempt from woe
      Eternal, more than other kings, endued
    With better sense and hearts, whom History mentions,
    Who long have "paved Hell with their good intentions."[520]


                        XXXVIII.

    Michael began: "What wouldst thou with this man,
      Now dead, and brought before the Lord? What ill
    Hath he wrought since his mortal race began,
      That thou canst claim him? Speak! and do thy will,
    If it be just: if in this earthly span
      He hath been greatly failing to fulfil
    His duties as a king and mortal, say,
    And he is thine; if not--let him have way."

                        XXXIX.

    "Michael!" replied the Prince of Air, "even here
      Before the gate of Him thou servest, must
    I claim my subject: and will make appear
      That as he was my worshipper in dust,
    So shall he be in spirit, although dear
      To thee and thine, because nor wine nor lust
    Were of his weaknesses; yet on the throne
    He reigned o'er millions to serve me alone.

                        XL.

    "Look to _our_ earth, or rather _mine_; it was,
      _Once, more_ thy master's: but I triumph not
    In this poor planet's conquest; nor, alas!
      Need he thou servest envy me my lot:
    With all the myriads of bright worlds which pass
      In worship round him, he may have forgot
    Yon weak creation of such paltry things:
    I think few worth damnation save their kings,

                        XLI.

    "And these but as a kind of quit-rent, to
      Assert my right as Lord: and even had
    I such an inclination,'twere (as you
      Well know) superfluous; they are grown so bad,
    That Hell has nothing better left to do
      Than leave them to themselves: so much more mad
    And evil by their own internal curse,
    Heaven cannot make them better, nor I worse.

                        XLII.

    "Look to the earth, I said, and say again:
      When this old, blind, mad, helpless, weak, poor worm
    Began in youth's first bloom and flush to reign,
      The world and he both wore a different form,
    And much of earth and all the watery plain
      Of Ocean called him king: through many a storm
    His isles had floated on the abyss of Time;
    For the rough virtues chose them for their clime.[521]

                        XLIII.

    "He came to his sceptre young; he leaves it old:
      Look to the state in which he found his realm,
    And left it; and his annals too behold,
      How to a minion first he gave the helm;[522]
    How grew upon his heart a thirst for gold,
      The beggar's vice, which can but overwhelm
    The meanest hearts; and for the rest, but glance
    Thine eye along America and France.

                        XLIV.

    "'Tis true, he was a tool from first to last
      (I have the workmen safe); but as a tool
    So let him be consumed. From out the past
      Of ages, since mankind have known the rule
    Of monarchs--from the bloody rolls amassed
      Of Sin and Slaughter--from the Cæsars' school,
    Take the worst pupil; and produce a reign
    More drenched with gore, more cumbered with the slain.

                        XLV.

    "He ever warred with freedom and the free:
      Nations as men, home subjects, foreign foes,
    So that they uttered the word 'Liberty!'
      Found George the Third their first opponent. Whose
    History was ever stained as his will be
      With national and individual woes?[gt]
    I grant his household abstinence; I grant
    His neutral virtues, which most monarchs want;

                        XLVI.

    "I know he was a constant consort; own
      He was a decent sire, and middling lord.
    All this is much, and most upon a throne;
      As temperance, if at Apicius' board,
    Is more than at an anchorite's supper shown.
      I grant him all the kindest can accord;
    And this was well for him, but not for those
    Millions who found him what Oppression chose.

                        XLVII.

    "The New World shook him off; the Old yet groans
      Beneath what he and his prepared, if not
    Completed: he leaves heirs on many thrones
      To all his vices, without what begot
    Compassion for him--his tame virtues; drones
      Who sleep, or despots who have now forgot
    A lesson which shall be re-taught them, wake
    Upon the thrones of earth; but let them quake!

                        XLVIII.

    "Five millions of the primitive, who hold
      The faith which makes ye great on earth, implored
    A _part_ of that vast _all_ they held of old,--[gu]
      Freedom to worship--not alone your Lord,
    Michael, but you, and you, Saint Peter! Cold
      Must be your souls, if you have not abhorred
    The foe to Catholic participation[523]
    In all the license of a Christian nation.

                        XLIX.

    "True! he allowed them to pray God; but as
      A consequence of prayer, refused the law
    Which would have placed them upon the same base
      With those who did not hold the Saints in awe."
    But here Saint Peter started from his place
      And cried, "You may the prisoner withdraw:
    Ere Heaven shall ope her portals to this Guelph,
    While I am guard, may I be damned myself!

                        L.

    "Sooner will I with Cerberus exchange
      My office (and _his_ is no sinecure)
    Than see this royal Bedlam-bigot range[gv]
      The azure fields of Heaven, of that be sure!"
    "Saint!" replied Satan, "you do well to avenge
      The wrongs he made your satellites endure;
    And if to this exchange you should be given,
    I'll try to coax _our_ Cerberus up to Heaven!"

                        LI.

    Here Michael interposed: "Good Saint! and Devil!
      Pray, not so fast; you both outrun discretion.
    Saint Peter! you were wont to be more civil:
      Satan! excuse this warmth of his expression,
    And condescension to the vulgar's level:[gw]
      Even Saints sometimes forget themselves in session.
    Have you got more to say?"--"No."--"If you please,
    I'll trouble you to call your witnesses."

                        LII.

    Then Satan turned and waved his swarthy hand,
      Which stirred with its electric qualities
    Clouds farther off than we can understand,
      Although we find him sometimes in our skies;
    Infernal thunder shook both sea and land
      In all the planets--and Hell's batteries
    Let off the artillery, which Milton mentions
    As one of Satan's most sublime inventions.[524]

                        LIII.

    This was a signal unto such damned souls
      As have the privilege of their damnation
    Extended far beyond the mere controls
      Of worlds past, present, or to come; no station
    Is theirs particularly in the rolls
      Of Hell assigned; but where their inclination
    Or business carries them in search of game,
    They may range freely--being damned the same.

                        LIV.

    They are proud of this--as very well they may,
      It being a sort of knighthood, or gilt key
    Stuck in their loins;[525] or like to an "entré"[gx]
      Up the back stairs, or such free-masonry.
    I borrow my comparisons from clay,
      Being clay myself. Let not those spirits be
    Offended with such base low likenesses;
    We know their posts are nobler far than these.[gy]

                        LV.

    When the great signal ran from Heaven to Hell--
      About ten million times the distance reckoned
    From our sun to its earth, as we can tell
      How much time it takes up, even to a second,
    For every ray that travels to dispel
      The fogs of London, through which, dimly beaconed,
    The weathercocks are gilt some thrice a year,
    If that the _summer_ is not too severe:[526]

                        LVI.

    I say that I can tell--'twas half a minute;
      I know the solar beams take up more time
    Ere, packed up for their journey, they begin it;[gz]
      But then their Telegraph is less sublime,[527]
    And if they ran a race, they would not win it
      'Gainst Satan's couriers bound for their own clime.
    The sun takes up some years for every ray
    To reach its goal--the Devil not half a day.

                        LVII.

    Upon the verge of space, about the size
      Of half-a-crown, a little speck appeared
    (I've seen a something like it in the skies
      In the Ægean, ere a squall); it neared,
    And, growing bigger, took another guise;
      Like an aërial ship it tacked, and steered,[528]
    Or _was_ steered (I am doubtful of the grammar
    Of the last phrase, which makes the stanza stammer;

                        LVIII.

    But take your choice): and then it grew a cloud;
      And so it was--a cloud of witnesses.
    But such a cloud! No land ere saw a crowd
      Of locusts numerous as the heavens saw these;[ha]
    They shadowed with their myriads Space; their loud
      And varied cries were like those of wild geese,[hb]
    (If nations may be likened to a goose),
    And realised the phrase of "Hell broke loose."[529]

                        LIX.

    Here crashed a sturdy oath of stout John Bull,
      Who damned away his eyes as heretofore:
    There Paddy brogued "By Jasus!"--"What's your wull?"
      The temperate Scot exclaimed: the French ghost swore
    In certain terms I shan't translate in full,
      As the first coachman will; and 'midst the war,[hc]
    The voice of Jonathan was heard to express,
    "_Our_ President is going to war, I guess."

                        LX.

    Besides there were the Spaniard, Dutch, and Dane;
      In short, an universal shoal of shades
    From Otaheite's isle to Salisbury Plain,
      Of all climes and professions, years and trades,
    Ready to swear against the good king's reign,[hd]
      Bitter as clubs in cards are against spades:[530]
    All summoned by this grand "subpoena," to
    Try if kings mayn't be damned like me or you.

                        LXI.

    When Michael saw this host, he first grew pale,
      As Angels can; next, like Italian twilight,
    He turned all colours--as a peacock's tail,
      Or sunset streaming through a Gothic skylight
    In some old abbey, or a trout not stale,
      Or distant lightning on the horizon by night,
    Or a fresh rainbow, or a grand review
    Of thirty regiments in red, green, and blue.

                        LXII.

    Then he addressed himself to Satan: "Why--
      My good old friend, for such I deem you, though
    Our different parties make us fight so shy,
      I ne'er mistake you for a _personal_ foe;
    Our difference _political_, and I
      Trust that, whatever may occur below,
    You know my great respect for you: and this
    Makes me regret whate'er you do amiss--

                        LXIII.

    "Why, my dear Lucifer, would you abuse
      My call for witnesses? I did not mean
    That you should half of Earth and Hell produce;
      'Tis even superfluous, since two honest, clean,
    True testimonies are enough: we lose
      Our Time, nay, our Eternity, between
    The accusation and defence: if we
    Hear both, 'twill stretch our immortality."

                        LXIV.

    Satan replied, "To me the matter is
      Indifferent, in a personal point of view:
    I can have fifty better souls than this
      With far less trouble than we have gone through
    Already; and I merely argued his
      Late Majesty of Britain's case with you
    Upon a point of form: you may dispose
    Of him; I've kings enough below, God knows!"

                        LXV.

    Thus spoke the Demon (late called "multifaced"[531]
      By multo-scribbling Southey). "Then we'll call
    One or two persons of the myriads placed
      Around our congress, and dispense with all
    The rest," quoth Michael: "Who may be so graced
      As to speak first? there's choice enough--who shall
    It be?" Then Satan answered, "There are many;
    But you may choose Jack Wilkes as well as any."

                        LXVI.

    A merry, cock-eyed, curious-looking Sprite[532]
      Upon the instant started from the throng,
    Dressed in a fashion now forgotten quite;
      For all the fashions of the flesh stick long
    By people in the next world; where unite
      All the costumes since Adam's, right or wrong,
    From Eve's fig-leaf down to the petticoat,
    Almost as scanty, of days less remote.[533]

                        LXVII.

    The Spirit looked around upon the crowds
      Assembled, and exclaimed, "My friends of all
    The spheres, we shall catch cold amongst these clouds;
      So let's to business: why this general call?
    If those are freeholders I see in shrouds,
      And 'tis for an election that they bawl,
    Behold a candidate with unturned coat![he]
    Saint Peter, may I count upon your vote?"

                        LXVIII.

    "Sir," replied Michael, "you mistake; these things
      Are of a former life, and what we do
    Above is more august; to judge of kings
      Is the tribunal met: so now you know."
    "Then I presume those gentlemen with wings,"[hf]
      Said Wilkes, "are Cherubs; and that soul below
    Looks much like George the Third, but to my mind
    A good deal older--bless me! is he blind?"

                        LXIX.

    "He is what you behold him, and his doom
      Depends upon his deeds," the Angel said;
    "If you have aught to arraign in him, the tomb
      Gives license to the humblest beggar's head
    To lift itself against the loftiest."--"Some,"
      Said Wilkes, "don't wait to see them laid in lead,
    For such a liberty--and I, for one,
    Have told them what I thought beneath the sun."

                        LXX.

    "_Above_ the sun repeat, then, what thou hast
      To urge against him," said the Archangel. "Why,"
    Replied the spirit, "since old scores are past,
      Must I turn evidence? In faith, not I.
    Besides, I beat him hollow at the last[534],
      With all his Lords and Commons: in the sky
    I don't like ripping up old stories, since
    His conduct was but natural in a prince.

                        LXXI.

    "Foolish, no doubt, and wicked, to oppress
      A poor unlucky devil without a shilling;
    But then I blame the man himself much less
      Than Bute and Grafton[535], and shall be unwilling
    To see him punished here for their excess,
      Since they were both damned long ago, and still in
    Their place below: for me, I have forgiven,
    And vote his _habeas corpus_ into Heaven."

                        LXXII.

    "Wilkes," said the Devil, "I understand all this;
      You turned to half a courtier[536] ere you died,
    And seem to think it would not be amiss
      To grow a whole one on the other side
    Of Charon's ferry; you forget that _his_
      Reign is concluded; whatsoe'er betide,
    He won't be sovereign more: you've lost your labour,
    For at the best he will but be your neighbour.

                        LXXIII.

    "However, I knew what to think of it,
      When I beheld you in your jesting way,
    Flitting and whispering round about the spit
      Where Belial, upon duty for the day[hg],
    With Fox's lard was basting William Pitt,
      His pupil; I knew what to think, I say:
    That fellow even in Hell breeds farther ills;
    I'll have him _gagged_--'twas one of his own Bills[537].

                        LXXIV.

    "Call Junius!" From the crowd a shadow stalked[538].
      And at the name there was a general squeeze,
    So that the very ghosts no longer walked
      In comfort, at their own aërial ease,
    But were all rammed, and jammed (but to be balked,
      As we shall see), and jostled hands and knees,
    Like wind compressed and pent within a bladder,
    Or like a human colic, which is sadder.[hh]

                        LXXV.

    The shadow came--a tall, thin, grey-haired figure,
      That looked as it had been a shade on earth[hi];
    Quick in its motions, with an air of vigour,
      But nought to mark its breeding or its birth;
    Now it waxed little, then again grew bigger[hj],
      With now an air of gloom, or savage mirth:
    But as you gazed upon its features, they
    Changed every instant--to _what_, none could say.

                        LXXVI.

    The more intently the ghosts gazed, the less
      Could they distinguish whose the features were;
    The Devil himself seemed puzzled even to guess;
      They varied like a dream--now here, now there;
    And several people swore from out the press,
      They knew him perfectly; and one could swear
    He was his father; upon which another
    Was sure he was his mother's cousin's brother:

                        LXXVII.

    Another, that he was a duke, or knight,
      An orator, a lawyer, or a priest,
    A nabob, a man-midwife;[539] but the wight[hk]
      Mysterious changed his countenance at least
    As oft as they their minds: though in full sight
      He stood, the puzzle only was increased;
    The man was a phantasmagoria in
    Himself--he was so volatile and thin.

                        LXXVIII.

    The moment that you had pronounced him _one_,
      Presto! his face changed, and he was another;
    And when that change was hardly well put on,
      It varied, till I don't think his own mother
    (If that he had a mother) would her son
      Have known, he shifted so from one to t'other;
    Till guessing from a pleasure grew a task,[hl]
    At this epistolary "Iron Mask."[540]

                        LXXIX.

    For sometimes he like Cerberus would seem--
      "Three gentlemen at once"[541] (as sagely says
    Good Mrs. Malaprop); then you might deem
      That he was not even _one_; now many rays
    Were flashing round him; and now a thick steam
      Hid him from sight--like fogs on London days:
    Now Burke, now Tooke, he grew to people's fancies
    And certes often like Sir Philip Francis.

                        LXXX.

    I've an hypothesis--'tis quite my own;
      I never let it out till now, for fear
    Of doing people harm about the throne,
      And injuring some minister or peer,
    On whom the stigma might perhaps be blown;
      It is--my gentle public, lend thine ear!
    'Tis, that what Junius we are wont to call,[hm]
    Was _really--truly_--nobody at all.


                        LXXXI.

    I don't see wherefore letters should not be
      Written without hands, since we daily view
    Them written without heads; and books, we see,
      Are filled as well without the latter too:
    And really till we fix on somebody
      For certain sure to claim them as his due,
    Their author, like the Niger's mouth,[542] will bother
    The world to say if _there_ be mouth or author.

                        LXXXII.

    "And who and what art thou?" the Archangel said.
      "For _that_ you may consult my title-page,"[543]
    Replied this mighty shadow of a shade:
      "If I have kept my secret half an age,
    I scarce shall tell it now."--"Canst thou upbraid,"
      Continued Michael, "George Rex, or allege
    Aught further?" Junius answered, "You had better
    First ask him for _his_ answer to my letter:

                        LXXXIII.

    "My charges upon record will outlast[hn]
      The brass of both his epitaph and tomb."
    "Repent'st thou not," said Michael, "of some past
      Exaggeration? something which may doom
    Thyself if false, as him if true? Thou wast
      Too bitter--is it not so?--in thy gloom
    Of passion?"--"Passion!" cried the phantom dim,
    "I loved my country, and I hated him.


                        LXXXIV.

    "What I have written, I have written: let
      The rest be on his head or mine!" So spoke
    Old "_Nominis Umbra_;" and while speaking yet,
      Away he melted in celestial smoke.
    Then Satan said to Michael, "Don't forget
      To call George Washington, and John Horne Tooke,
    And Franklin;"[544]--but at this time there was heard
    A cry for room, though not a phantom stirred.

                        LXXXV.

    At length with jostling, elbowing, and the aid
      Of Cherubim appointed to that post,
    The devil Asmodeus[545] to the circle made
      His way, and looked as if his journey cost
    Some trouble. When his burden down he laid,
      "What's this?" cried Michael; "why, 'tis not a ghost?"
    "I know it," quoth the Incubus; "but he
    Shall be one, if you leave the affair to me.

                        LXXXVI.

    "Confound the renegado![546] I have sprained
      My left wing, he's so heavy;[547] one would think
    Some of his works about his neck were chained.
      But to the point; while hovering o'er the brink
    Of Skiddaw (where as usual it still rained),
      I saw a taper, far below me, wink,
    And stooping, caught this fellow at a libel--[ho]
    No less on History--than the Holy Bible.

                        LXXXVII.

    "The former is the Devil's scripture, and
      The latter yours, good Michael: so the affair
    Belongs to all of us, you understand.
      I snatched him up just as you see him there,
    And brought him off for sentence out of hand:
      I've scarcely been ten minutes in the air--
    At least a quarter it can hardly be:
    I dare say that his wife is still at tea."[548]

                        LXXXVIII.

    Here Satan said, "I know this man of old,
      And have expected him for some time here;
    A sillier fellow you will scarce behold,
      Or more conceited in his petty sphere:
    But surely it was not worth while to fold
      Such trash below your wing, Asmodeus dear:
    We had the poor wretch safe (without being bored
    With carriage) coming of his own accord.

                        LXXXIX.

    "But since he's here, let's see what he has done."
      "Done!" cried Asmodeus, "he anticipates
    The very business you are now upon,
      And scribbles as if head clerk to the Fates.[hp]
    Who knows to what his ribaldry may run,
      When such an ass[549] as this, like Balaam's, prates?"
    "Let's hear," quoth Michael, "what he has to say:
    You know we're bound to that in every way."

                        XC.

    Now the bard, glad to get an audience, which
      By no means often was his case below,
    Began to cough, and hawk, and hem, and pitch
      His voice into that awful note of woe
    To all unhappy hearers within reach
      Of poets when the tide of rhyme's in flow;[550]
    But stuck fast with his first hexameter,
    Not one of all whose gouty feet would stir.

                        XCI.

    But ere the spavined dactyls could be spurred
      Into recitative, in great dismay
    Both Cherubim and Seraphim were heard
      To murmur loudly through their long array;
    And Michael rose ere he could get a word
      Of all his foundered verses under way,
    And cried, "For God's sake stop, my friend! 'twere best--[551]
    '_Non Di, non homines_'--you know the rest."[552]

                        XCII.

    A general bustle spread throughout the throng,
      Which seemed to hold all verse in detestation;
    The Angels had of course enough of song
      When upon service; and the generation
    Of ghosts had heard too much in life, not long
      Before, to profit by a new occasion:
    The Monarch, mute till then, exclaimed, "What! what![553]
    _Pye_[554] come again? No more--no more of that!"

                        XCIII.

    The tumult grew; an universal cough
      Convulsed the skies, as during a debate,
    When Castlereagh has been up long enough
      (Before he was first minister of state,
    I mean--the _slaves hear now_); some cried "Off, off!"
      As at a farce; till, grown quite desperate,
    The Bard Saint Peter prayed to interpose
    (Himself an author) only for his prose.

                        XCIV.

    The varlet was not an ill-favoured knave;[hq][555]
      A good deal like a vulture in the face,
    With a hook nose and a hawk's eye, which gave
      A smart and sharper-looking sort of grace
    To his whole aspect, which, though rather grave,
      Was by no means so ugly as his case;
    But that, indeed, was hopeless as can be,
    Quite a poetic felony "_de se_."

                        XCV.

    Then Michael blew his trump, and stilled the noise
      With one still greater, as is yet the mode
    On earth besides; except some grumbling voice,
      Which now and then will make a slight inroad
    Upon decorous silence, few will twice
      Lift up their lungs when fairly overcrowed;
    And now the Bard could plead his own bad cause,
    With all the attitudes of self-applause.

                        XCVI.

    He said--(I only give the heads)--he said,
      He meant no harm in scribbling; 'twas his way
    Upon all topics; 'twas, besides, his bread,
      Of which he buttered both sides; 'twould delay
    Too long the assembly (he was pleased to dread),
      And take up rather more time than a day,
    To name his works--he would but cite a few--[hr]
    "Wat Tyler"--"Rhymes on Blenheim"--"Waterloo."[556]

                        XCVII.

    He had written praises of a Regicide;[557]
      He had written praises of all kings whatever;
    He had written for republics far and wide,
      And then against them bitterer than ever;
    For pantisocracy he once had cried[558]
      Aloud, a scheme less moral than 'twas clever;
    Then grew a hearty anti-jacobin--
    Had turned his coat--and would have turned his skin.

                        XCVIII.

    He had sung against all battles, and again
      In their high praise and glory; he had called
    Reviewing "the ungentle craft," and then[559]
      Became as base a critic as e'er crawled--
    Fed, paid, and pampered by the very men
      By whom his muse and morals had been mauled:
    He had written much blank verse, and blanker prose,
    And more of both than any body knows.

                        XCIX.

    He had written Wesley's[560] life:--here turning round
      To Satan, "Sir, I'm ready to write yours,
    In two octavo volumes, nicely bound,
      With notes and preface, all that most allures
    The pious purchaser; and there's no ground
      For fear, for I can choose my own reviewers:
    So let me have the proper documents,
    That I may add you to my other saints."

                        C.

    Satan bowed, and was silent. "Well, if you,
      With amiable modesty, decline
    My offer, what says Michael? There are few
      Whose memoirs could be rendered more divine.
    Mine is a pen of all work;[561] not so new
      As it was once, but I would make you shine
    Like your own trumpet. By the way, my own
    Has more of brass in it, and is as well blown.[hs]

                        CI.

    "But talking about trumpets, here's my 'Vision!'
      Now you shall judge, all people--yes--you shall
    Judge with my judgment! and by my decision
      Be guided who shall enter heaven or fall.
    I settle all these things by intuition,
      Times present, past, to come--Heaven--Hell--and all,
    Like King Alfonso[562]. When I thus see double,
    I save the Deity some worlds of trouble."

                        CII.

    He ceased, and drew forth an MS.; and no
      Persuasion on the part of Devils, Saints,
    Or Angels, now could stop the torrent; so
      He read the first three lines of the contents:
    But at the fourth, the whole spiritual show
    Had vanished, with variety of scents,
    Ambrosial and sulphureous, as they sprang,
    Like lightning, off from his "melodious twang."[563]

                        CIII.

    Those grand heroics acted as a spell;
      The Angels stopped their ears and plied their pinions;
    The Devils ran howling, deafened, down to Hell;
      The ghosts fled, gibbering, for their own dominions--
    (For 'tis not yet decided where they dwell,
      And I leave every man to his opinions);
    Michael took refuge in his trump--but, lo!
    His teeth were set on edge, he could not blow!

                        CIV.

    Saint Peter, who has hitherto been known
      For an impetuous saint, upraised his keys,
    And at the fifth line knocked the poet down;[564]
      Who fell like Phaeton, but more at ease,
    Into his lake, for there he did not drown;
      A different web being by the Destinies
    Woven for the Laureate's final wreath, whene'er
    Reform shall happen either here or there.

                        CV.

    He first sank to the bottom--like his works,
      But soon rose to the surface--like himself;
    For all corrupted things are buoyed like corks,[565]
      By their own rottenness, light as an elf,
    Or wisp that flits o'er a morass: he lurks,
      It may be, still, like dull books on a shelf,
    In his own den, to scrawl some "Life" or "Vision,"[ht]
    As Welborn says--"the Devil turned precisian."[566]

                        CVI.

    As for the rest, to come to the conclusion
      Of this true dream, the telescope is gone[hu]
    Which kept my optics free from all delusion,
      And showed me what I in my turn have shown;
    All I saw farther, in the last confusion,
      Was, that King George slipped into Heaven for one;
    And when the tumult dwindled to a calm,
    I left him practising the hundredth psalm.[567]

                                                        R^a^ Oct. 4, 1821.

[493] {482}[These were not the expressions employed by Lord Eldon. The
Chancellor laid down the principle that "damages cannot be recovered for
a work which is in its nature calculated to do an injury to the public,"
and assuming _Wat Tyler_ to be of this description, he refused the
injunction until Southey should have established his right to the
property by an action. _Wat Tyler_ was written at the age of nineteen,
when Southey was a republican, and was entrusted to two booksellers,
Messrs. Ridgeway and Symonds, who agreed to publish it, but never put it
to press. The MS. was not returned to the author, and in February, 1817,
at the interval of twenty-two years, when his sentiments were widely
different, it was printed, to his great annoyance, by W. Benbow (see his
_Scourge for the Laureate_ (1825), p. 14), Sherwood, Neely and Jones,
John Fairburn, and others. It was reported that 60,000 copies were sold
(see _Life and Correspondence of R. Southey_, 1850, iv. 237, 241, 249,
252).]

[494] [William Smith, M.P. for Norwich, attacked Southey in the House of
Commons on the 14th of March, 1817, and the Laureate replied by a letter
in the _Courier_, dated March 17, 1817, and by a letter "To William
Smith, Esq., M.P." (see _Essays Moral and Political_, by R. Southey,
1832, ii. 7-31). The exact words used were, "the determined malignity of
a renegade" (see Hansard's _Parl. Debates_, xxxv. 1088).]

[495] [One of Southey's juvenile poems is an "Inscription for the
Apartment in Chepstow Castle, where Henry Martin, the Regicide, was
imprisoned thirty years" (see Southey's _Poems_, 1797, p. 59). Canning
parodied it in the _Anti-jacobin_ (see his well-known "Inscription for
the Door of the Cell in Newgate, where Mrs. Brownrigg, the
'Prentice-cide, was confined, previous to her Execution," _Poetry of the
Anti-jacobin_, 1828, p. 6).]

[498] [Walter Savage Landor (1775-1864) had recently published a volume
of Latin poems (_Idyllia Heroica Decem. Librum Phaleuciorum Unum_.
Partim jam primum Partim iterum atque tertio edit Savagius Landor.
Accedit Quæstiuncula cur Poetæ Latini Recentiores minus leguntur, Pisis,
1820, 410). In his Preface to the _Vision of Judgement_, Southey
illustrates his denunciation of "Men of diseased hearts," etc. (_vide
ante_, p. 476), by a quotation from the Latin essay: "Summi poetæ in
omni poetarum sæculo viri fuerunt probi: in nostris id vidimus et
videmus; neque alius est error a veritate longiùs quàm magna ingenia
magnis necessario corrumpi vitiis," etc. (_Idyllia_, p. 197). It was a
cardinal maxim of the Lake School "that there can be no great poet who
is not a good man.... His heart must be pure" (see Table Talk, by S. T.
Coleridge, August 20, 1833); and Landor's testimony was welcome and
consolatory. "Of its author," he adds, "I will only say in this place,
that, to have obtained his approbation as a poet, and possessed his
friendship as a man, will be remembered among the honours of my life."
Now, apart from the essay and its evident application, Byron had
probably observed that among the _Phaleucia_, or Hendecasyllables, were
included some exquisite lines _Ad Sutheium_ (on the death of Herbert
Southey), followed by some extremely unpleasant ones on _Taunto_ and his
tongue, and would naturally conclude that "Savagius" was ready to do
battle for the Laureate if occasion arose. Hence the side issue. With
regard to the "Ithyphallics," there are portions of the Latin poems
(afterwards expunged, see _Poemata et Inscriptiones_, Moxon, 1847)
included in the Pisa volume which might warrant the description; but
from a note to _The Island_ (Canto II. stanza xvii. line 10) it may be
inferred that some earlier collection of Latin verses had come under
Byron's notice. For Landor's various estimates of Byron's works and
genius, see _Works_, 1876, iv. 44-46, 88, 89, etc.]

coffin, again enclosed in another mahogany coffin, and the whole finally
placed in the state coffin of Spanish mahogany, covered with the richest
Genoa velvet of royal purple, a few shades deeper in tint than Garter
blue. The lid was divided into three compartments by double rows of
silver-gilt nails, and in the compartment at the head, over a rich star
of the Order of the Garter was placed the Royal Arms of England,
beautifully executed in dead Gold.... In the lower compartment at the
feet was the British Lion _Rampant, regardant_, supporting a shield with

proposition [to admit 'Catholics and Dissenters to offices, and
Catholics to Parliament'] tending to destroy the groundwork [that all
who held employments in the State must be members of the Church of
England] of our happy constitution." Finally, in 1807, he demanded of
ministers "a positive assurance that they would never again propose to
him any concession to the Catholics."--See _Life of Pitt_, by Earl
Stanhope, 1879, ii. 434, 461; _Dict. of Nat. Biog._, art. "George III."]

Wilkes squints more than "a gentleman should squint." The costume--long
coat, waistcoat buttoned to the neck, knee-breeches, and stockings--is
not unpleasing, but the expression of the face is something between a
leer and a sneer. Walpole (_Letters_, 1858, vii. 274) describes another
portrait (by Zoffani) as "a delightful piece of Wilkes looking--no,
squinting tenderly at his daughter. It is a caricature of the Devil
acknowledging Miss Sin in Milton."]

[534] {510}[On his third return to Parliament for Middlesex, October 8,

following February, and on subsequent occasions, he endeavoured to
induce the House to rescind the resolutions passed January 19, 1764,
under which he had been expelled from Parliament, and named as
blasphemous, obscene, etc. Finally, May, 1782, he obtained a substantial
majority on a division, and the obnoxious resolutions were ordered to be
expunged from the journals of the House.]

[535] [Bute, as leader of the king's party, was an open enemy; Grafton,
a half-hearted friend. The duke (1736-1811) would have visited him in
the Tower (1763), "to hear from himself his own story and his defence;"
but rejected an appeal which Wilkes addressed to him (May 3) to become
surety for bail. He feared that such a step might "come under the
denomination of an insult on the Crown." A writ of _Habeas Corpus_ (see
line 8) was applied for by Lord Temple and others, and, May 6, Wilkes
was discharged by Lord Chief Justice Pratt, on the ground of privilege.
Three years later (November 1, 1766), on his return from Italy, Wilkes
sought to obtain Grafton's protection and interest; but the duke, though
he consulted Chatham, and laid Wilkes's letter before the King, decided
to "take no notice" of this second appeal. In his _Autobiography_
Grafton is careful to define "the extent of his knowledge" of Mr.
Wilkes, and to explain that he was not "one of his intimates"--a
_caveat_ which warrants the statement of Junius that "as for Mr. Wilkes,
it is, perhaps, the greatest misfortune of his life, that you should
have so many compensations to make in the closet for your former
friendship with him. Your gracious Master understands your character;
and makes you a persecutor because you have been a friend" ("Letter
(xii.) to the Duke of Grafton," May 30, 1769).--_Memoirs of Augustus

[536] {511}[In 1774 Wilkes was elected Lord Mayor, and in the following
spring it fell to his lot to present to the King a remonstrance from the
Livery against the continuance of the war with America. Walpole (April
17, 1775, Letters, 1803, vi. 257) says that "he used his triumph with
moderation--in modern language with good breeding." The King is said to
have been agreeably surprised at his demeanour. In his old age (1790) he
voted against the Whigs. A pasquinade, written by Sheridan, Tickell, and
Lord John Townshend, anticipated the devil's insinuations--

Byron wrote, in his _Journal_ of November 23, 1813, "I don't know what
to think. Why should Junius be yet dead?.... the man must be alive, and
will never die without the disclosure" (_Letters_, 1893, ii. 334); but
an article (by Brougham) in the _Edinburgh Review_, vol. xxix. p. 94, on
_The Identity of Junius with a Distinguished Living Character

published by W. Hone in 1817; and it is also included in an "Appendix"
entitled _The Stripling Bard, or the Apostate Laureate_, affixed to
another edition issued in the same year by John Fairburn. The purport
and _motif_ of these excellent rhymes is non-patriotic if not
Jacobinical, but, for some reason, the poem has been considered
improving for the young, and is included in many "Poetry Books" for

this calumny was no doubt a counterblast on Byron's part to the supposed
charge of a "league of incest" (at Diodati, in 1816), which he
maintained had been disseminated by Coleridge on the authority of
Southey (_vide ante_, p. 475). It is, perhaps, unnecessary to state that
before Pantisocracy was imagined or devised, one of the future
pantisocrats, Robert Lovell, was married to Mary Fricker; that Robert
Southey was engaged to be married to her sister Edith; and that, as a
result of the birth and evolution of the scheme, Coleridge became
engaged to be married to a third sister, Sarah, hitherto loverless, in
order that "every Jack should have his Jill," and the world begin anew
in a second Eden across the seas. All things were to be held in common,

a blank leaf of the first volume, Coleridge expressed his desire that
his copy should be given to Southey as a bequest. "One or other volume,"
he writes, "was more often in my hands than any other in my ragged
book-regiment ... How many an hour of self-oblivion do I owe to this
Life of Wesley!"--Third ed. 1846, i. xv.]

[562] {523}King Alfonso, speaking of the Ptolomean system, said, that
"had he been consulted at the creation of the world, he would have
spared the Maker some absurdities. [Alphonso X., King of Castile
(1221-1284), surnamed the Wise and the Astronomer, "gave no small
encouragement to the Jewish rabbis." Under his patronage Judah de Toledo
translated the works of Avicenna, and improved them by a new division of
the stars. Moreover, "he sent for about 50 learned men from Gascony,
Paris, and other places, to translate the tables of Ptolemy, and to
compile a more correct set of them (i.e. the famous _Tabulæ Alphonsinæ_)
... The king himself presided over the assembly."--_Mod. Univ. Hist._,
xiii. 304, 305, note(U).

Alfonso has left behind him the reputation of a Castilian
Hamlet--"infinite in faculty," but "unpregnant of his cause." "He was
more fit," says Mariana (_Hist._, lib. xiii. c. 20), "for letters than
for the government of his subjects; he studied the heavens and watched
the stars, but forgot the earth and lost his kingdom." Nevertheless his
works do follow him. "He is to be remembered for his poetry
(_'Cántigas'_, chants in honour of the Virgin, and _'Tesoro'_ a treatise
on the philosopher's stone), for his astronomical tables, which all the
progress of science have not deprived of their value, and for his great
work on legislation, which is at this moment an authority in both
hemispheres."--_Hist. of Spanish Literature_, by G. Ticknor, 1888, i. 7.

Byron got the quip about Alfonso and "the absurdities of creation" from
Bayle (_Dict_., 1735, art. "Castile"), who devotes a long note (H) to a
somewhat mischievous apology for the king's apparent profanity. Bayle's
immediate authority is Le Bovier de Fontenelle, in his _Entretiens sur
la Pluralité des Mondes_, 1686, p. 38, "L'embaras de tous ces cercles
estoit si grand, que dans un temps où l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de

  A VERY MOURNFUL BALLAD[568] ON THE SIEGE AND CONQUEST OF ALHAMA.[569]


_Which, in the Arabic language, is to the following purport_[570]


                        1.

    The Moorish King rides up and down.
    Through Granada's royal town:
    From Elvira's gates to those
    Of Bivarambla on he goes.
                        Woe is me, Alhama![hv][571]

                        2.

    Letters to the Monarch tell
    How Alhama's city fell:
    In the fire the scroll he threw,
    And the messenger he slew.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        3.

    He quits his mule, and mounts his horse,
    And through the street directs his course;
    Through the street of Zacatin
    To the Alhambra spurring in.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        4.

    When the Alhambra walls he gained,
    On the moment he ordained
    That the trumpet straight should sound
    With the silver clarion round.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        5.

    And when the hollow drums of war
    Beat the loud alarm afar,
    That the Moors of town and plain
    Might answer to the martial strain.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        6.

    Then the Moors, by this aware,
    That bloody Mars recalled them there,
    One by one, and two by two,
    To a mighty squadron grew.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        7.

    Out then spake an aged Moor
    In these words the king before,
    "Wherefore call on us, oh King?
    What may mean this gathering?"
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        8.

    "Friends! ye have, alas! to know
    Of a most disastrous blow--
    That the Christians, stern and bold,
    Have obtained Alhama's hold."
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        9.

    Out then spake old Alfaqui,[572]
    With his beard so white to see,
    "Good King! thou art justly served,
    Good King! this thou hast deserved.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        10.

    "By thee were slain, in evil hour,
    The Abencerrage, Granada's flower;
    And strangers were received by thee,
    Of Cordova the Chivalry.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        11.

    "And for this, oh King! is sent
    On thee a double chastisement;
    Thee and thine, thy crown and realm,
    One last wreck shall overwhelm.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        12.

    "He who holds no laws in awe,
    He must perish by the law;
    And Granada must be won,
    And thyself with her undone."
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        13.

    Fire flashed from out the old Moor's eyes,
    The Monarch's wrath began to rise,
    Because he answered, and because
    He spake exceeding well of laws.[573]
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        14.

    "There is no law to say such things
    As may disgust the ear of kings:"--
    Thus, snorting with his choler, said
    The Moorish King, and doomed him dead.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        15.

    Moor Alfaqui! Moor Alfaqui![574]
    Though thy beard so hoary be,[hw]
    The King hath sent to have thee seized,
    For Alhama's loss displeased.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        16.

    And to fix thy head upon
    High Alhambra's loftiest stone;
    That this for thee should be the law,
    And others tremble when they saw.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        17.

    "Cavalier, and man of worth!
    Let these words of mine go forth;
    Let the Moorish Monarch know,
    That to him I nothing owe.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        18.

    "But on my soul Alhama weighs,
    And on my inmost spirit preys;
    And if the King his land hath lost,
    Yet others may have lost the most.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        19.

    "Sires have lost their children, wives
    Their lords, and valiant men their lives!
    One what best his love might claim
    Hath lost, another wealth, or fame.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        20.

    "I lost a damsel in that hour,
    Of all the land the loveliest flower;
    Doubloons a hundred I would pay,
    And think her ransom cheap that day."
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        21.

    And as these things the old Moor said,
    They severed from the trunk his head;
    And to the Alhambra's wall with speed
    'Twas carried, as the King decreed.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        22.

    And men and infants therein weep
    Their loss, so heavy and so deep;
    Granada's ladies, all she rears
    Within her walls, burst into tears.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        23.

    And from the windows o'er the walls
    The sable web of mourning falls;
    The King weeps as a woman o'er
    His loss, for it is much and sore.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                       SONETTO DI VITTORELLI.[575]

                               PER MONACA.

     Sonetto composto in nome di un genitore, a cui era motta poco
     innanzi una figlia appena maritata: e diretto al genitore della
     sacra sposa.

    Di due vaghe donzelle, oneste, accorte
        Lieti e miseri padri il ciel ne feo,
        Il ciel, die degne di più nobil sorte
        L' una e l' altra veggendo, ambe chiedeo.

    La mia fu tolta da veloce morte
        A le fumanti tede d' Imeneo:
        La tua, Francesco, in suggellate porte
        Eterna prigioniera or si rendeo.

    Ma tu almeno potrai dalla gelosa
        Irremeabil soglia, ove s' asconde,
        La sua tenera udir voce pietosa.

    Io verso un flume d' amarissim' onde,
        Corro a quel marmo, in cui la figlia or posa:
        Batto, e ribatto, ma nessun risponde.

                                ON A NUN.

     Sonnet composed in the name of a father, whose daughter had
     recently died shortly after her marriage; and addressed to the
     father of her who had lately taken the veil.

    Of two fair virgins, modest, though admired,
        Heaven made us happy; and now, wretched sires,
        Heaven for a nobler doom their worth desires,
        And gazing upon _either, both_ required.

    Mine, while the torch of Hymen newly fired
        Becomes extinguished,--soon--too soon expires;
        But thine, within the closing grate retired,
        Eternal captive, to her God aspires.

    But _thou_ at least from out the jealous door,
        Which shuts between your never-meeting eyes,
        May'st hear her sweet and pious voice once more:

    I to the marble, where _my_ daughter lies,
        Rush,--the swoln flood of bitterness I pour,
        And knock, and knock, and knock--but none replies.

                   ON THE BUST OF HELEN BY CANOVA.[576]

    In this belovéd marble view
      Above the works and thoughts of Man,
    What Nature _could_ but _would not_ do,
      And Beauty and Canova _can!_

      Beyond the Bard's defeated art,
    With Immortality her dower,
      Behold the _Helen_ of the heart.

                         VENICE. A FRAGMENT.[577]

    'Tis midnight--but it is not dark
    Within thy spacious place, St. Mark!
    The Lights within, the Lamps without,
    Shine above the revel rout.
    The brazen Steeds are glittering o'er
    The holy building's massy door,
    Glittering with their collars of gold,
    The goodly work of the days of old--
    And the wingéd Lion stern and solemn
    Frowns from the height of his hoary column,
    Facing the palace in which doth lodge
    The ocean-city's dreaded Doge.
    The palace is proud--but near it lies,
    Divided by the "Bridge of Sighs,"
    The dreary dwelling where the State
    Enchains the captives of their hate:
    These--they perish or they pine;
    But which their doom may none divine:
    Many have passed that Arch of pain,
    But none retraced their steps again.

    It is a princely colonnade!
    And wrought around a princely place,
    When that vast edifice displayed
    Looks with its venerable face
    Over the far and subject sea,
    Which makes the fearless isles so free!
    And 'tis a strange and noble pile,
    Pillared into many an aisle:
    Every pillar fair to see,
    Marble--jasper--and porphyry--
    The Church of St. Mark--which stands hard by
    With fretted pinnacles on high,
    And Cupola and minaret;
    More like the mosque of orient lands,
    Than the fanes wherein we pray,
    And Mary's blesséd likeness stands.--

                        1.

    So we'll go no more a-roving
      So late into the night,
    Though the heart be still as loving,
      And the moon be still as bright.

                        2.

    For the sword outwears its sheath,
      And the soul wears out the breast,
    And the heart must pause to breathe,
      And Love itself have rest.

                        3.

    Though the night was made for loving,
      And the day returns too soon,
    Yet we'll go no more a-roving
      By the light of the moon.

    Nose and Chin that make a knocker,[hx]
    Wrinkles that would puzzle Cocker;
    Mouth that marks the envious Scorner,
    With a Scorpion in each corner
    Curling up his tail to sting you,[hy]
    In the place that most may wring you;
    Eyes of lead-like hue and gummy,
    Carcase stolen from some mummy,
    Bowels--(but they were forgotten,
    Save the Liver, and that's rotten),                                 10
    Skin all sallow, flesh all sodden,
    Form the Devil would frighten G--d in.
    Is't a Corpse stuck up for show,[580]
    Galvanized at times to go?
    With the Scripture has't connection,[hz]
    New proof of the Resurrection?
    Vampire, Ghost, or Goul (_sic_), what is it?
    I would walk ten miles to miss it.



                                 ANSWER.

    Many passengers arrest one,
    To demand the same free question.                                   20
    Shorter's my reply and franker,--
    That's the Bard, and Beau, and Banker:
    Yet, if you could bring about
    Just to turn him inside out,
    Satan's self would seem less sooty,
    And his present aspect--Beauty.
    Mark that (as he masks the bilious)
    Air so softly supercilious,
    Chastened bow, and mock humility,
    Almost sickened to Servility:                                       30
    Hear his tone (which is to talking
    That which creeping is to walking--
    Now on all fours, now on tiptoe):
    Hear the tales he lends his lip to--
    Little hints of heavy scandals--
    Every friend by turns he handles:
    All that women or that men do
    Glides forth in an inuendo (_sic_)--
    Clothed in odds and ends of humour,
    Herald of each paltry rumour--                                      40
    From divorces down to dresses,
    Woman's frailties, Man's excesses:
    All that life presents of evil
    Make for him a constant revel.
    You're his foe--for that he fears you,
    And in absence blasts and sears you:
    You're his friend--for that he hates you,
    First obliges, and then baits you,
    Darting on the opportunity
    When to do it with impunity:                                        50
    You are neither--then he'll flatter,
    Till he finds some trait for satire;
    Hunts your weak point out, then shows it,
    Where it injures, to expose it
    In the mode that's most insidious,
    Adding every trait that's hideous--
    From the bile, whose blackening river
    Rushes through his Stygian liver.

    Then he thinks himself a lover--[581]
    Why? I really can't discover,                                       60
    In his mind, age, face, or figure;
    Viper broth might give him vigour:
    Let him keep the cauldron steady,
    He the venom has already.

    For his faults--he has but _one_;
    'Tis but Envy, when all's done:
    He but pays the pain he suffers,
    Clipping, like a pair of Snuffers,
    Light that ought to burn the brighter
    For this temporary blighter.                                        70
    He's the Cancer of his Species,
    And will eat himself to pieces,--
    Plague personified and Famine,--
    Devil, whose delight is damning.[582]

                        1.

    'Tis fifty years, and yet their fray
    To us might seem but yesterday.
    Tis fifty years, and three to boot,
    Since, hand to hand, and foot to foot,
    And heart to heart, and sword to sword,
    One of our Ancestors was gored.
    I've seen the sword that slew him;[584] he,
    The slain, stood in a like degree
    To thee, as he, the Slayer, stood
    (Oh had it been but other blood!)
    In kin and Chieftainship to me.
    Thus came the Heritage to thee.

                        2.

    To me the Lands of him who slew
      Came through a line of yore renowned;
    For I can boast a race as true
      To Monarchs crowned, and some discrowned,
    As ever Britain's Annals knew:
    For the first Conqueror gave us Ground,[585]
      And the last Conquered owned the line
      Which was my mother's, and is mine.

                        3.

    I loved thee--I will not say _how_,
    Since things like these are best forgot:
    Perhaps thou may'st imagine now
      Who loved thee, and who loved thee not.
    And thou wert wedded to another,[586]
      And I at last another wedded:
    I am a father, thou a mother,
      To Strangers vowed, with strangers bedded.
    For land to land, even blood to blood--
      Since leagued of yore our fathers were--
    Our manors and our birthright stood;
    And not unequal had I wooed,
      If to have wooed thee I could dare.
    But this I never dared--even yet
    When naught is left but to forget.
      I feel that I could only love:
    To sue was never meant for me,
    And least of all to sue to thee;
    For many a bar, and many a feud,
    Though never told, well understood
      Rolled like a river wide between--
    And then there was the Curse of blood,
      Which even my Heart's can not remove.
      Alas! how many things have been!
    Since we were friends; for I alone
    Feel more for thee than can be shown.

                        4.

    How many things! I loved thee--thou
      Loved'st me not: another was
    The Idol of thy virgin vow,
      And I was, what I am, Alas!
    And what he is, and what thou art,
      And what we were, is like the rest:
      We must endure it as a test,

                         STANZAS TO THE PO.[588]

                        1.

    River, that rollest by the ancient walls,
      Where dwells the Lady of my love, when she
    Walks by thy brink, and there perchance recalls
      A faint and fleeting memory of me:

                        2.

    What if thy deep and ample stream should be
      A mirror of my heart, where she may read
    The thousand thoughts I now betray to thee,
      Wild as thy wave, and headlong as thy speed!

                        3.

    What do I say--a mirror of my heart?
      Are not thy waters sweeping, dark, and strong?
    Such as my feelings were and are, thou art;
      And such as thou art were my passions long.

                        4.

    Time may have somewhat tamed them,--not for ever;
      Thou overflow'st thy banks, and not for aye
    Thy bosom overboils, congenial river!
      Thy floods subside, and mine have sunk away:

                        5.

    But left long wrecks behind, and now again,[ib]
      Borne in our old unchanged career, we move:
    Thou tendest wildly onwards to the main,
      And I--to loving _one_ I should not love.

                        6.

    The current I behold will sweep beneath
      Her native walls, and murmur at her feet;
    Her eyes will look on thee, when she shall breathe
      The twilight air, unharmed by summer's heat.

                        7.

    She will look on thee,--I have looked on thee,
      Full of that thought: and, from that moment, ne'er
    Thy waters could I dream of, name, or see,
      Without the inseparable sigh for her!

                        8.

    Her bright eyes will be imaged in thy stream,--
      Yes! they will meet the wave I gaze on now:
    Mine cannot witness, even in a dream,
      That happy wave repass me in its flow!

                        9.

    The wave that bears my tears returns no more:
      Will she return by whom that wave shall sweep?--
    Both tread thy banks, both wander on thy shore,
      I by thy source, she by the dark-blue deep.[ic]


                        10.

    But that which keepeth us apart is not
      Distance, nor depth of wave, nor space of earth,
    But the distraction of a various lot,
      As various as the climates of our birth.

                        11.

    A stranger loves the Lady of the land,[id]
      Born far beyond the mountains, but his blood
    Is all meridian, as if never fanned
      By the black wind that chills the polar flood.[ie]

                        12.

    My blood is all meridian; were it not,
      I had not left my clime, nor should I be,[if]
    In spite of tortures, ne'er to be forgot,
      A slave again of love,--at least of thee.

                        13.

    'Tis vain to struggle--let me perish young--
      Live as I lived, and love as I have loved;
    To dust if I return, from dust I sprung,
      And then, at least, my heart can ne'er be moved.

          SONNET ON THE NUPTIALS OF THE MARQUIS ANTONIO CAVALLI
            WITH THE COUNTESS CLELIA RASPONI OF RAVENNA.[589]

    A noble Lady of the Italian shore
      Lovely and young, herself a happy bride,
      Commands a verse, and will not be denied,
    From me a wandering Englishman; I tore
    One sonnet, but invoke the muse once more
      To hail these gentle hearts which Love has tied,
      In Youth, Birth, Beauty, genially allied
    And blest with Virtue's soul, and Fortune's store.
    A sweeter language, and a luckier bard
      Were worthier of your hopes, Auspicious Pair!
    And of the sanctity of Hymen's shrine,
      But,--since I cannot but obey the Fair,
    To render your new state your true reward,
      May your Fate be like _Hers_, and unlike _mine._

                     SONNET TO THE PRINCE REGENT.[ig]
          ON THE REPEAL OF LORD EDWARD FITZGERALD'S FORFEITURE.

    To be the father of the fatherless,
      To stretch the hand from the throne's height, and raise
      _His_ offspring, who expired in other days
    To make thy Sire's sway by a kingdom less,--[ih]
    _This_ is to be a monarch, and repress
      Envy into unutterable praise.
      Dismiss thy guard, and trust thee to such traits,
    For who would lift a hand, except to bless?[ii]
      Were it not easy, Sir, and is't not sweet
      To make thyself belovéd? and to be
    Omnipotent by Mercy's means? for thus
      Thy Sovereignty would grow but more complete,
    A despot thou, and yet thy people free,[ij]
      And by the heart--not hand--enslaving us.

        Could Love for ever
        Run like a river,
        And Time's endeavour
          Be tried in vain--
        No other pleasure
        With this could measure;
        And like a treasure[ik]
          We'd hug the chain.
        But since our sighing
        Ends not in dying,
        And, formed for flying,
          Love plumes his wing;
        Then for this reason
        Let's love a season;
    But let that season be only Spring.


                        2.

        When lovers parted
        Feel broken-hearted,
        And, all hopes thwarted,
          Expect to die;
        A few years older,
        Ah! how much colder
        They might behold her
          For whom they sigh!
        When linked together,
        In every weather,[il]
        They pluck Love's feather
          From out his wing--
        He'll stay for ever,[im]
        But sadly shiver
    Without his plumage, when past the Spring.[in]

                        3.

        Like Chiefs of Faction,
        His life is action--
        A formal paction
          That curbs his reign,
        Obscures his glory,
        Despot no more, he
        Such territory
          Quits with disdain.
        Still, still advancing,
        With banners glancing,
        His power enhancing,
          He must move on--
        Repose but cloys him,
        Retreat destroys him,
    Love brooks not a degraded throne.

                        4.

        Wait not, fond lover!
        Till years are over,
        And then recover
          As from a dream.
        While each bewailing
        The other's failing.
        With wrath and railing,
          All hideous seem--
        While first decreasing,
        Yet not quite ceasing,
        Wait not till teasing,
          All passion blight:
        If once diminished
        Love's reign is finished--
    Then part in friendship,--and bid good-night.[io]

                        5.

        So shall Affection
        To recollection
        The dear connection
          Bring back with joy:
        You had not waited[ip]
        Till, tired or hated,
        Your passions sated
          Began to cloy.
        Your last embraces
        Leave no cold traces--
        The same fond faces
          As through the past:
        And eyes, the mirrors
        Of your sweet errors,
    Reflect but rapture--not least though last.


                        6.

        True, separations[iq]
        Ask more than patience;
        What desperations
          From such have risen!
        But yet remaining,
        What is't but chaining
        Hearts which, once waning,
          Beat 'gainst their prison?
        Time can but cloy love,
        And use destroy love:
        The wingéd boy, Love,
          Is but for boys--
        You'll find it torture
        Though sharper, shorter,
    To wean, and not wear out your joys.

             ODE TO A LADY WHOSE LOVER WAS KILLED BY A BALL,

Motto.

     _On peut trouver des femmes qui n'ont jamais eu de galanterie, mais
     il est rare d'en trouver qui n'en aient jamais eu
     qu'une_.--[_Réflexions_ ... du Duc de la Rochefoucauld, No.
     lxxiii.]

                        1.

      Lady! in whose heroic port
    And Beauty, Victor even of Time,
      And haughty lineaments, appear
      Much that is awful, more that's dear--
      Wherever human hearts resort
      _There_ must have been for thee a Court,
      And Thou by acclamation Queen,
      Where never Sovereign yet had been.
    That eye so soft, and yet severe,
      Perchance might look on Love as Crime;
    And yet--regarding thee more near--
    The traces of an unshed tear
      Compressed back to the heart,
    And mellowed Sadness in thine air,
    Which shows that Love hath once been there,
    To those who watch thee will disclose
    More than ten thousand tomes of woes
      Wrung from the vain Romancer's art.
    With thee how proudly Love hath dwelt!
    His full Divinity was felt,
    Maddening the heart he could not melt,
      Till Guilt became Sublime;
    But never yet did Beauty's Zone
    For him surround a lovelier throne,
    Than in that bosom once his own:
      And he the Sun and Thou the Clime
    Together must have made a Heaven
    For which the Future would be given.

                        2.

    And thou hast loved--Oh! not in vain!
      And not as common Mortals love.
        The Fruit of Fire is Ashes,
        The Ocean's tempest dashes
    Wrecks and the dead upon the rocky shore:
    True Passion must the all-searching changes prove,
      The Agony of Pleasure and of Pain,
      Till Nothing but the Bitterness remain;
      And the Heart's Spectre flitting through the brain
    Scoffs at the Exorcism which would remove.

                        3.

    And where is He thou lovedst? in the tomb,
      Where should the happy Lover be!
    For him could Time unfold a brighter doom,
      Or offer aught like thee?
    He in the thickest battle died,
      Where Death is Pride;
    And _Thou_ his widow--not his bride,
      Wer't not more free--
    _Here_ where all love, till Love is made
      A bondage or a trade,
    _Here_--thou so redolent of Beauty,
    In whom Caprice had seemed a duty,
    _Thou_, who could'st trample and despise
    The holiest chain of human ties
    For him, the dear One in thine eyes,
      Broke it no more.
    Thy heart was withered to it's Core,
    It's hopes, it's fears, it's feelings o'er:
    Thy Blood grew Ice when _his_ was shed,
    And Thou the Vestal of the Dead.

                        4.

    Thy Lover died, as All
      Who truly love should die;
    For such are worthy in the fight to fall
      Triumphantly.
    No Cuirass o'er that glowing heart
    The deadly bullet turned apart:
    Love had bestowed a richer Mail,
      Like Thetis on her Son;
    But hers at last was vain, and thine could fail--
      The hero's and the lover's race was run.
    Thy worshipped portrait, thy sweet face,
    _Without_ that bosom kept it's place
      As Thou _within_.
    Oh! enviously destined Ball!
    Shivering thine imaged charms and all
      Those Charms would win:
    Together pierced, the fatal Stroke hath gored
    Votary and Shrine, the adoring and the adored.
      That Heart's last throb was thine, that blood
      Baptized thine Image in it's flood,
      And gushing from the fount of Faith
      O'erflowed with Passion even in Death,
    Constant to thee as in it's hour
    Of rapture in the secret bower.
    Thou too hast kept thy plight full well,
    As many a baffled Heart can tell.

paltry rider."--[_Life of Curran_, ii. 336.]


                        1.

    Ere the daughter of Brunswick is cold in her grave,[593]
    And her ashes still float to their home o'er the tide,
    Lo! George the triumphant speeds over the wave,
      To the long-cherished Isle which he loved like his--bride.

                        2.

    True, the great of her bright and brief Era are gone,
      The rain-bow-like Epoch where Freedom could pause
    For the few little years, out of centuries won,
      Which betrayed not, or crushed not, or wept not her cause.

                        3.

    True, the chains of the Catholic clank o'er his rags,
      The Castle still stands, and the Senate's no more,
    And the Famine which dwelt on her freedomless crags
      Is extending its steps to her desolate shore.

                        4.

    To her desolate shore--where the emigrant stands
      For a moment to gaze ere he flies from his hearth;
    Tears fall on his chain, though it drops from his hands,
      For the dungeon he quits is the place of his birth.

                        5.

    But he comes! the Messiah of Royalty comes!
      Like a goodly Leviathan rolled from the waves;
    Then receive him as best such an advent becomes,[is]
      With a legion of cooks,[594] and an army of slaves!

                        6.

    He comes in the promise and bloom of threescore,
      To perform in the pageant the Sovereign's part--[it]
    But long live the Shamrock, which shadows him o'er!
      Could the Green in his _hat_ be transferred to his _heart!_

                        7.

    Could that long-withered spot but be verdant again,
      And a new spring of noble affections arise--
    Then might Freedom forgive thee this dance in thy chain,
      And this shout of thy slavery which saddens the skies.

                        8.

    Is it madness or meanness which clings to thee now?
      Were he God--as he is but the commonest clay,
    With scarce fewer wrinkles than sins on his brow--
      Such servile devotion might shame him away.

                        9.

    Aye, roar in his train![595] let thine orators lash
      Their fanciful spirits to pamper his pride--
    Not thus did thy Grattan indignantly flash
      His soul o'er the freedom implored and denied.

                        10.

    Ever glorious Grattan! the best of the good!
      So simple in heart, so sublime in the rest!
    With all which Demosthenes wanted endued,
      And his rival, or victor, in all he possessed.

                        11.

    Ere Tully arose in the zenith of Rome,
      Though unequalled, preceded, the task was begun--
    But Grattan sprung up like a god from the tomb
      Of ages, the first, last, the saviour, the _one!_[596]

                        12.

    With the skill of an Orpheus to soften the brute;
      With the fire of Prometheus to kindle mankind;
    Even Tyranny, listening, sate melted or mute,
      And Corruption shrunk scorched from the glance of his mind.

                        13.

    But back to our theme! Back to despots and slaves![iu]
      Feasts furnished by Famine! rejoicings by Pain!
    True Freedom but _welcomes_, while Slavery still _raves_,
      When a week's Saturnalia hath loosened her chain.

                        14.

    Let the poor squalid splendour thy wreck can afford,
      (As the bankrupt's profusion his ruin would hide)
    Gild over the palace, Lo! Erin, thy Lord!
      Kiss his foot with thy blessing--his blessings denied![iv]

                        15.

    Or _if_ freedom past hope be extorted at last,[iw]
      If the idol of brass find his feet are of clay,
    Must what terror or policy wring forth be classed
      With what monarchs ne'er give, but as wolves yield their prey?

                        16.

    Each brute hath its nature; a King's is to _reign_,--
      To _reign!_ in that word see, ye ages, comprised
    The cause of the curses all annals contain,
      From Cæsar the dreaded to George the despised!

                        17.

    Wear, Fingal, thy trapping![597] O'Connell, proclaim[ix]
      His accomplishments! _His!!!_ and thy country convince
    Half an age's contempt was an error of fame,
      And that "Hal is the rascaliest, sweetest _young_ prince!"[iy]

                        18.

    Will thy yard of blue riband, poor Fingal, recall
      The fetters from millions of Catholic limbs?
    Or, has it not bound thee the fastest of all
      The slaves, who now hail their betrayer with hymns?

                        19.

    Aye! "Build him a dwelling!" let each give his mite![598]
      Till, like Babel, the new royal dome hath arisen![iz]
    Let thy beggars and helots their pittance unite--
      And a palace bestow for a poor-house and prison!

                        20.

    Spread--spread for Vitellius, the royal repast,
      Till the gluttonous despot be stuffed to the gorge!
    And the roar of his drunkards proclaim him at last
      The Fourth of the fools and oppressors called "George!"

                        21.

    Let the tables be loaded with feasts till they groan!
      Till they _groan_ like thy people, through ages of woe!
    Let the wine flow around the old Bacchanal's throne,
      Like their blood which has flowed, and which yet has to flow.

                        22.

    But let not _his_ name be thine idol alone--
      On his right hand behold a Sejanus appears!
    Thine own Castlereagh! let him still be thine own!
      A wretch never named but with curses and jeers!

                        23.

    Till now, when the Isle which should blush for his birth,
      Deep, deep as the gore which he shed on her soil,
    Seems proud of the reptile which crawled from her earth,
      And for murder repays him with shouts and a smile.[599]

                        24.

    Without one single ray of her genius,--without
      The fancy, the manhood, the fire of her race--
    The miscreant who well might plunge Erin in doubt[ja]
      If _she_ ever gave birth to a being so base.

                        25.

    If she did--let her long-boasted proverb be hushed,
      Which proclaims that from Erin no reptile can spring--
    See the cold-blooded Serpent, with venom full flushed,
      Still warming its folds in the breast of a King![jb]

                        26.

    Shout, drink, feast, and flatter! Oh! Erin, how low
      Wert thou sunk by misfortune and tyranny, till
    Thy welcome of tyrants hath plunged thee below
      The depth of thy deep in a deeper gulf still.

                        27.

    My voice, though but humble, was raised for thy right;[600]
      My vote, as a freeman's, still voted thee free;
    This hand, though but feeble, would arm in thy fight,[jc]
      And this heart, though outworn, had a throb still for _thee!_

                        28.

    Yes, I loved thee and thine, though thou art not my land;[jd]
      I have known noble hearts and great souls in thy sons,
    And I wept with the world, o'er the patriot band
      Who are gone, but I weep them no longer as once.

                        29.

    For happy are they now reposing afar,--
      Thy Grattan, thy Curran, thy Sheridan,[601] all
    Who, for years, were the chiefs in the eloquent war,
      And redeemed, if they have not retarded, thy fall.

                        30.

    Yes, happy are they in their cold English graves!
      Their shades cannot start to thy shouts of to-day--
    Nor the steps of enslavers and chain-kissing slaves[je]
      Be stamped in the turf o'er their fetterless clay.

                        31.

    Till now I had envied thy sons and their shore,
      Though their virtues were hunted, their liberties fled;[jf]
    There was something so warm and sublime in the core
      Of an Irishman's heart, that I envy--thy _dead_.[jg]

                        32.

    Or, if aught in my bosom can quench for an hour
      My contempt for a nation so servile, though sore,
    Which though trod like the worm will not turn upon power,
      'Tis the glory of Grattan, and genius of Moore![jh][602]

FOOTNOTES:

[568] {529}[Byron does not give his authority for the Spanish original
of his _Romance Muy Doloroso_. In default of any definite information,
it may be surmised that his fancy was caught by some broadside or
chap-book which chanced to come into his possession, and that he made
his translation without troubling himself about the origin or
composition of the ballad. As it stands, the "Romance" is a cento of
three or more ballads which are included in the _Guerras Civiles de
Granada_ of Ginès Perez de Hita, published at Saragossa in 1595 (see ed.
"En Alcala de Henares," 1601, pp. 249-252). Stanzas 1-11, "Passeavase el
Rey Moro," etc., follow the text which De Hita gives as a translation
from the Arabic; stanzas 12-14 are additional, and do not correspond
with any of the Spanish originals; stanzas 15-21, with numerous
deviations and omissions, follow the text of a second ballad, "Moro
Alcayde, Moro Alcayde," described by De Hita as "antiguo Romance," and
portions of stanzas 21-23 are imbedded in a ballad entitled "Muerte dada
á Los Abencerrajes" (Duran's _Romancero General_, 1851, ii. 89).

The ballad as a whole was not known to students of Spanish literature
previous to the publication of Byron's translation (1818), (see _Ancient
Ballads from the Civil Wars of Granada_, by Thomas Rodd, 1801, pp. 93,
98; Southey's _Common-Place Book_, iv. 262-266, and his _Chronicle of
the Cid_, 1808, pp. 371-374), and it has not been included by H. Duran
in his _Romancero General_, 1851, ii. 89-91, or by F. Wolf and C.
Hofmann in their _Primavera y Flor de Romances_, 1856, i. 270-278. At
the same time, it is most improbable that Byron was his own
"Centonista," and it may be assumed that the Spanish text as printed
(see _Childe Harold,_ Canto IV., 1818, pp. 240-254, and _Poetical
Works_, 1891, pp. 566, 567) was in his possession or within his reach.
(For a correspondence on the subject, see _Notes and Queries_, Third
Series, vol. xii. p. 391, and Fourth Series, vol. i. p. 162.)

A MS. of the Spanish text, sent to England for "copy," is in a foreign
handwriting. Two MSS. (A, B) of the translation are in Mr. Murray's
possession: A, a rough draft; B, a fair copy. The watermark of A is
1808, of B (dated January 4, 1817) 1800. It is to be noted that the
refrain in the Spanish text is _Ay de mi Alhama_, and that the insertion
of the comma is a printer's or reader's error.]

Granada, Albania was surprised and occupied by the Christians under Don
Rodrigo Ponce de Leon.]

[570] The effect of the original ballad--which existed both in Spanish
and Arabic--was such, that it was forbidden to be sung by the Moors, on
pain of death, within Granada. ["This ballad was so dolorous in the
original Arabic language, that every time it was sung it acted as an
incitement to grief and despair, and for this reason it was at length
finally prohibited in Granada."--_Historia ... de las Guerras Civiles_,
translated from the Arabic of Abenhamim, by Ginès Perez de Hita, and
from the Spanish by Thomas Rodd, 1803, p. 334. According to Ticknor
(_Hist. of Spanish Literature_, 1888, iii. 139), the "Arabic origin" of
De Hita's work is not at all probable. "He may have obtained Arabic
materials for parts of his story."]

[574] {533}[The Alcaide or "governor" of the original ballad is
converted into the Alfaqui of stanza 9. It was the "Alcaide," in whose
absence Alhama was taken, and who lost children, wife, honour, and his
own head in consequence (_Notes and Queries_, iv. i. 162).]

office as a subordinate in the Ministry of Education at Milan, and was
elected a member of the college of "Dotti." At a later period of his
life he returned to Bassano, and received an appointment as censor of
the press. His poetry, which is sweet and musical, but lacking in force
and substance, recalls and embodies the style and spirit of the dying
literature of the eighteenth century. "He lived and died," says Luigi
Carrer, "the poet of Irene and Dori," unmoved by the hopes and fears,
the storms and passions, of national change and development.--See

works of Antonio Canova, engraved in outline by Henry Moses (London,

that it was executed in 1814, and presented to the Countess Albrizzi.

[579] [Lady Blessington told Crabb Robinson (Diary, 1869, in. 17) that
the publication of the _Question and Answer_ would "kill Rogers." The
MS. is dated 1818, and it is probable that the lines were written in the
early spring of that year. Moore or Murray had told Byron that Rogers
was in doubt whether to praise or blame him in his poem on "Human Life"
now approaching completion; and he had heard, from other sources, that
it was Rogers who was the author or retailer of certain scandalous
stories which were current in the "whispering-gallery of the world." He
had reason to believe that everybody was talking about him, and it was a
relief to be able to catch and punish so eminent a scandal-monger. It
was in this spirit that he wrote to Murray (February 20, 1818), "What
you tell me of Rogers, ... is like him. He cannot say that I have not
been a sincere and warm friend to him, till the black drop of his liver
oozed through too palpably to be overlooked. Now if I once catch him at
any of his jugglery with me or mine, let him look to it," etc., etc.,
and in all probability the "poem on Rogers" was then in existence, or
was working in his brain. The lines once written, Byron swallowed his
venom, and, when Rogers visited Italy in the autumn of 1821, he met him
at Bologna, travelled with him across the Apennines to Florence, and
invited him "to stay as long as he liked" at Pisa. Thither Rogers came,
presumably, in November, 1821, and, if we may trust the _Table Talk_
(1856, p. 238), remained at the Palazzo Lanfranchi for several days.

Byron seems to have been more than usually provocative and
cross-grained, and, on one occasion (see Medwin, _Angler in Wales_,
1834, i. 26, _sq_.; and _Records of Shelley, etc_., by E. T. Trelawney,
1878, i. 53), when he was playing billiards, and Rogers was in the lobby
outside, secretly incited his bull-dog, "Faithful Moretto," to bark and
show his teeth; and, when Medwin had convoyed the terror-stricken bard
into his presence, greeted him with effusion, but contrived that he
should sit down on the very sofa which hid from view the MS. of
"Question and Answer." _Longa est injuria, longæ ambages_; but the story
rests on the evidence of independent witnesses.

By far the best comment on satire and satirist is to be found in the
noble lines in _Italy_, in which Rogers commemorates his last meeting
with the "Youth who swam from Sestos to Abydos"--

                          "If imagined wrongs
    Pursued thee, urging thee sometimes to do
    Things long regretted, oft, as many know,
    None more than I, thy gratitude would build
    On slight foundations; and, if in thy life
    Not happy, in thy death thou surely wert,
    Thy wish accomplished."

[583] [Addressed to Miss Chaworth, in allusion to a duel fought between
two of their ancestors, D[ominus] B[yron] and Mr. C., January 26, 1765.

Byron and Mary Anne Chaworth were fourth cousins, both being fifth in
descent from George, Viscount Chaworth, whose daughter Elizabeth was
married to William, third Lord Byron (d. 1695), the poet's
great-great-grandfather. The duel between their grand-uncles, William,
fifth Lord Byron, and William Chaworth, Esq., of Annesley, was fought
between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of Saturday, January 26,
1765 (see _The Gazetteer_, Monday, January 28, 1765), at the Star and
Garter Tavern, Pall Mall. The coroner's jury brought in a verdict of
wilful murder (see for the "Inquisition," and report of trial, _Journals
of the House of Lords_, 1765, pp. 49, 126-135), and on the presentation
of their testimony to the House of Lords, Byron pleaded for a trial "by
God and his peers," whereupon he was arrested and sent to the Tower. The
case was tried by the Lords Temporal (the Lords Spiritual asked
permission to withdraw), and, after a defence had been read by the
prisoner, 119 peers brought in a verdict of "Not guilty of murder,
guilty of manslaughter, on my honour." Four peers only returned a
verdict of "Not guilty." The result of this verdict was that Lord Byron
claimed the benefit of the statute of Edward VI., and was discharged on
paying the fees.

The defence, which is given in full (see Journal, etc., for April 17,
1765), is able and convincing. Whilst maintaining an air of chivalry and
candour, the accused contrived to throw the onus of criminality on his
antagonist. It was Mr. Chaworth who began the quarrel, by sneering at
his cousin's absurd and disastrous leniency towards poachers. It was
Chaworth who insisted on an interview, not on the stairs, but in a
private room, who locked the door, and whose demeanour made a challenge
"to draw" inevitable. The room was dimly lit, and when the table was
pushed back, the space for the combatants was but twelve feet by five.
After two thrusts had been parried, and Lord Byron's shirt had been
torn, he shifted a little to the right, to take advantage of such light
as there was, came to close quarters with his adversary and, "as he
supposed, gave the unlucky wound which he would ever reflect upon with
the utmost regret."

If there was any truth in his plea, the "wicked Lord Byron" has been
misjudged, and, at least in the matter of the duel, was not so black as
he has been painted. For Byron's defence of his grand-uncle, see letter
to M. J. J. Coulmann, Genoa, July 12, 1823, _Life_, by Karl Elze, 1872,
pp. 443-446.]

[584] {543}[In the coroner's "Inquisition," the sword is described as
being "made of iron and steel, of the value of five shillings." Byron
says that "so far from feeling any remorse for having killed Mr.
Chaworth, who was a fire-eater (_spadassin_), ... he always kept the
sword ... in his bed-chamber, where it still was when he
died."--_Ibid._, p. 445.]

[588] {545} [There has been some misunderstanding with regard to this
poem. According to the statement of the Countess Guiccioli (see _Works
of Lord Byron_, ed. 1832, xii. 14), "Stanzas to the Po" were composed
about the middle of April, 1819, "while Lord Byron was actually sailing
on the Po," _en route_ from Venice to Ravenna. Medwin, who was the first
to publish the lines (_Conversations, etc._, 1824, 410, pp. 24-26), says
that they were written when Byron was about to "quit Venice to join" the
Countess at Ravenna, and, in a footnote, explains that the river
referred to is the Po. Now, if the Countess and Medwin (and Moore, who
follows Medwin, _Life_, p. 396) are right, and the river is the Po, the
"ancient walls" Ravenna, and the "Lady of the land" the Guiccioli, the
stanzas may have been written in June (not April), 1819, possibly at
Ferrara, and the river must be the Po di Primaro. Even so, the first
line of the first stanza and the third and fourth lines of the ninth
stanza require explanation. The Po does not "roll by the ancient walls"
of Ravenna; and how could Byron be at one and the same time "by the
source" (stanza 9, line 4), and sailing on the river, or on some
canalized tributary or effluent? Be the explanation what it may--and it
is possible that the lines were _not_ originally designed for the
Countess, but for another "Lady of the land" (see letter to Murray, May
18, 1819)--it may be surmised that "the lines written last year on
crossing the Po," the "mere verses of society," which were given to
Kinnaird (see letter to Murray, May 8, 1820, and _Conversations of Lord
Byron with Lady Blessington_, 1834, p. 143), were not the sombre though
passionate elegy, "River, that rollest," but the bitter and somewhat
cynical rhymes, "Could Love for ever, Run like a river" (_vide post_, p.
549).]

[591] {549}["A friend of Lord Byron's, who was with him at Ravenna when
he wrote these stanzas, says, They were composed, like many others, with
no view of publication, but merely to relieve himself in a moment of
suffering. He had been painfully excited by some circumstances which
appeared to make it necessary that he should immediately quit Italy; and
in the day and the hour that he wrote the song was labouring under an
access of fever" (_Works_, 1832, xii. 317, note 1). Here, too, there is
some confusion of dates and places. Byron was at Venice, not at Ravenna,
December 1, 1819, when these lines were composed. They were sent, as
Lady Blessington testifies, to Kinnaird, and are probably identical with
the "mere verses of society," mentioned in the letter to Murray of May
8, 1820. The last stanza reflects the mood of a letter to the Countess
Guiccioli, dated November 25 (1819), "I go to save you, and leave a
country insupportable to me without you" (_Letters_, 1900, iv. 379, note

1901, v. 364.]

[592] [A few days before Byron enclosed these lines in a letter to Moore
(September 17, 1821) he had written to Murray (September 12): "If ever I
_do_ return to England ... I will write a poem to which _English Bards,
etc._, shall be New Milk, in comparison. Your present literary world of
mountebanks stands in need of such an Avatar." Hence the somewhat
ambiguous title. The word "Avatar" is not only applied ironically to
George IV. as the "Messiah of Royalty," but metaphorically to the poem,
which would descend in the "Capacity of Preserver" (see Sir W. Jones,
_Asiatic Research_, i. 234).

The "fury" which sent Byron into this "lawless conscription of
rhythmus," was inspired partly by an ungenerous attack on Moore, which
appeared in the pages of _John Bull_ ("Thomas Moore is not likely to
fall in the way of knighthood ... being public defaulter in his office
to a large amount.... [August 5]. It is true that we cannot from
principle esteem the writer of the _Twopenny Postbag_.... It is equally
true that we shrink from the profligacy," etc., August 12, 1821); and,
partly, by the servility of the Irish, who had welcomed George IV. with
an outburst of enthusiastic loyalty, when he entered Dublin in triumph
within ten days of the death of Queen Caroline. The _Morning Chronicle_,
August 8-August 18, 1821, prints effusive leading articles, edged with
black borders, on the Queen's illness, death, funeral procession, etc.,
over against a column (in small type) headed "The King in Dublin."
Byron's satire is a running comment on the pages of the _Morning
Chronicle_. Moore was in Paris at the time, being, as _John Bull_ said,
"obliged to live out of England," and Byron gave him directions that
twenty copies of the _Irish Avatar_ "should be carefully and privately
printed off." Medwin says that Byron gave him "a printed copy," but his
version (see _Conversations_, 1824, pp. 332-338), doubtless for
prudential reasons, omits twelve of the more libellous stanzas. The poem
as a whole was not published in England till 1831, when "George the
despised" was gone to his account. According to Crabb Robinson (_Diary_,
1869, ii. 437), Goethe said that "Byron's verses on George IV. (_Query?
The Irish Avatar_) were the sublime of hatred."]

Spartan foe, and thrice he offered the Hekatomphonia on Mount Ithome.
His name was held in honour long after "the rowers on their benches"

                       INTRODUCTION TO _THE BLUES_.


Byron's correspondence does not explain the mood in which he wrote _The
Blues_, or afford the slightest hint or clue to its _motif_ or occasion.
In a letter to Murray, dated Ravenna, August 7, 1821, he writes, "I send
you a thing which I scribbled off yesterday, a mere buffoonery, to quiz
'The Blues.' If published it must be _anonymously_.... You may send me a
proof if you think it worth the trouble." Six weeks later, September 20,
he had changed his mind. "You need not," he says, "send _The Blues_,
which is a mere buffoonery not meant for publication." With these
intimations our knowledge ends, and there is nothing to show why in
August, 1821, he took it into his head "to quiz The Blues," or why,
being so minded, he thought it worth while to quiz them in so pointless
and belated a fashion. We can but guess that an allusion in a letter
from England, an incident at a conversazione at Ravenna, or perhaps the
dialogues in Peacock's novels, _Melincourt_ and _Nightmare Abbey_,
brought to his recollection the half-modish, half-literary coteries of
the earlier years of the Regency, and that he sketches the scenes and
persons of his eclogue not from life, but from memory.

In the Diary of 1813, 1814, there is more than one mention of the
"Blues." For instance, November 27, 1813, he writes, "Sotheby is a
_Littérateur_, the oracle of the Coteries of the * *'s, Lydia White
(Sydney Smith's 'Tory Virgin'), Mrs. Wilmot (she, at least, is a swan,
and might frequent a purer stream), Lady Beaumont and all the Blues,
with Lady Charlemont at their head." Again on December 1, "To-morrow
there is a party _purple_ at the 'blue' Miss Berry's. Shall I go? um!--I
don't much affect your blue-bottles;--but one ought to be civil....
Perhaps that blue-winged Kashmirian butterfly of book-learning Lady
Charlemont will be there" (see _Letters_, 1898, ii. 333, 358, note 2).

Byron was, perhaps, a more willing guest at literary entertainments
than he professed to be. "I met him," says Sir Walter Scott (_Memoirs of
the Life, etc._, 1838, ii. 167), "frequently in society.... Some very
agreeable parties I can recollect, particularly one at Sir George
Beaumont's, where the amiable landlord had assembled some persons
distinguished for talent. Of these I need only mention the late Sir
Humphry Davy.... Mr. Richard Sharpe and Mr. Rogers were also present."

Again, Miss Berry, in her _Journal_ (1866, in. 49) records, May 8, 1815,
that "Lord and Lady Byron persuaded me to go with them to Miss [Lydia]
White (_vide post_, p. 587). Never have I seen a more imposing
convocation of ladies arranged in a circle than when we entered ... Lord
Byron brought me home. He stayed to supper." If he did not affect "your
blue-bottles," he was on intimate terms with Madame de Staël, "the
_Begum_ of Literature," as Moore called her; with the Contessa
d'Albrizzi (the De Staël of Italy); with Mrs. Wilmot, the inspirer of
"She walks in beauty like the night;" with Mrs. Shelley; with Lady
Blessington. Moreover, to say nothing of his "mathematical wife," who
was as "blue as ether," the Countess Guiccioli could not only read and
"inwardly digest" _Corinna_ (see letter to Moore, January 2, 1820), but
knew the _Divina Commedia_ by heart, and was a critic as well as an
inspirer of her lover's poetry.

If it is difficult to assign a reason or occasion for the composition of
_The Blues_, it is a harder, perhaps an impossible, task to identify all
the _dramatis personæ_. Botherby, Lady Bluemount, and Miss Diddle are,
obviously, Sotheby, Lady Beaumont, and Lydia White. Scamp the Lecturer
may be Hazlitt, who had incurred Byron's displeasure by commenting on
his various and varying estimates of Napoleon (see _Lectures on the
English Poets_, 1818, p. 304, and _Don Juan_, Canto 1. stanza ii. line
7, note to Buonaparte). Inkel seems to be meant for Byron himself, and
Tracy, a friend, _not_ a Lake poet, for Moore. Sir Richard and Lady
Bluebottle may possibly symbolize Lord and Lady Holland; and Miss Lilac
is, certainly, Miss Milbanke, the "Annabella" of Byron's courtship, not
the "moral Clytemnestra" of his marriage and separation.

_The Blues_ was published anonymously in the third number of the
_Liberal_, which appeared April 26, 1823. The "Eclogue" was not
attributed to Byron, and met with greater contempt than it deserved. In
the _Noctes Ambrosiance_ (Blackwood's _Edinburgh Magazine_, May, 1823,
vol. xiii. p. 607), the third number of the _Liberal_ is dismissed with
the remark, "The last Number contains not one _line_ of Byron's! Thank
God! he has seen his error, and kicked them out." Brief but contemptuous
notices appeared in the _Literary Chronicle_, April 26, and the
_Literary Gazette_, May 3, 1823; while a short-lived periodical, named
the _Literary Register_ (May 3, quoted at length in _John Bull_, May 4,
1823), implies that the author (i.e. Leigh Hunt) would be better
qualified to "catch the manners" of Lisson Grove than of May Fair. It is
possible that this was the "last straw," and that the reception of _The
Blues_ hastened Byron's determination to part company with the
profitless and ill-omened _Liberal_.

    To the torrent of trash which around him he pours,
    Pumped up with such effort, disgorged with such labour,             50
    That----come--do not make me speak ill of one's neighbour.

    _Tra_. _I_ make you!

    _Ink_.                   Yes, you! I said nothing until
    You compelled me, by speaking the truth----

    _Tra_.                               _To speak ill?_
    Is that your deduction?

    _Ink_.                 When speaking of Scamp ill,
    I certainly _follow, not set_ an example.
    The fellow's a fool, an impostor, a zany.

    _Tra_. And the crowd of to-day shows that one fool makes many.
    But we two will be wise.

    _Ink_.                  Pray, then, let us retire.

    _Tra_. I would, but----

    _Ink_.                There must be attraction much higher
    Than Scamp, or the Jew's harp he nicknames his lyre,                60
    To call you to this hotbed.

    _Tra_.                     I own it--'tis true--
    A fair lady----

    _Ink_.       A spinster?

    _Tra_.                  Miss Lilac.

    _Ink_.                               The Blue!

    _Tra_. The heiress! The angel!

    _Ink_.                         The devil! why, man,
    Pray get out of this hobble as fast as you can.
    _You_ wed with Miss Lilac! 'twould be your perdition:
    She's a poet, a chymist, a mathematician.[614]

    _Tra_. I say she's an angel.

    _Ink_.                      Say rather an angle.
    If you and she marry, you'll certainly wrangle.
    I say she's a Blue, man, as blue as the ether.

    _Tra_. And is that any cause for not coming together?               70

    _Ink_. Humph! I can't say I know any happy alliance
    Which has lately sprung up from a wedlock with science.
    She's so learnéd in all things, and fond of concerning
    Herself in all matters connected with learning,
    That----

    _Tra_.  What?

    _Ink_.        I perhaps may as well hold my tongue;
    But there's five hundred people can tell you you're
    wrong.

    _Tra_. You forget Lady Lilac's as rich as a Jew.

    _Ink_. Is it miss or the cash of mamma you pursue?

    _Tra_. Why, Jack, I'll be frank with you--something of both.
    The girl's a fine girl.

    _Ink_.                 And you feel nothing loth                    80
    To her good lady-mother's reversion; and yet
    Her life is as good as your own, I will bet.

    _Tra_. Let her live, and as long as she likes; I demand
    Nothing more than the heart of her daughter and hand.

    _Ink_. Why, that heart's in the inkstand--that hand on the pen.

    _Tra_. A propos--Will you write me a song now and then?

    _Ink_. To what purpose?

    _Tra_.                 You know, my dear friend, that in prose
    My talent is decent, as far as it goes;
    But in rhyme----

    _Ink_.         You're a terrible stick, to be sure.

    _Tra_. I own it; and yet, in these times, there's no lure           90
    For the heart of the fair like a stanza or two;
    And so, as I can't, will you furnish a few?

    _Ink_. In your name?

    _Tra_.               In my name. I will copy them out,
    To slip into her hand at the very next rout.

    _Ink_. Are you so far advanced as to hazard this?

    _Tra_.                                            Why,
    Do you think me subdued by a Blue-stocking's eye,
    So far as to tremble to tell her in rhyme
    What I've told her in prose, at the least, as sublime?

    _Ink_. _As sublime!_ If i be so, no need of my Muse.

    _Tra_. But consider, dear Inkel, she's one of the "Blues."100

    _Ink_. As sublime!--Mr. Tracy--I've nothing to say.
    Stick to prose--As sublime!!--but I wish you good day.

    _Tra_. Nay, stay, my dear fellow--consider--I'm wrong;
    I own it; but, prithee, compose me the song.

    _Ink_. _As_ sublime!!

    _Tra_.                 I but used the expression in haste.

    _Ink_. That may be, Mr. Tracy, but shows damned bad taste.

    _Tra_. I own it, I know it, acknowledge it--what
    Can I say to you more?

    _Ink_.                 I see what you'd be at:
    You disparage my parts with insidious abuse,
    Till you think you can turn them best to your own use.             110

    _Tra_. And is that not a sign I respect them?

    _Ink_.                                        Why that
    To be sure makes a difference.

    _Tra_.                        I know what is what:
    And you, who're a man of the gay world, no less
    Than a poet of t'other, may easily guess
    That I never could mean, by a word, to offend
    A genius like you, and, moreover, my friend.

    _Ink_. No doubt; you by this time should know what is due
    To a man of----but come--let us shake hands.

    _Tra_.                                      You knew,
    And you _know_, my dear fellow, how heartily I,
    Whatever you publish, am ready to buy.                             120

    _Ink_. That's my bookseller's business; I care not for sale;
    Indeed the best poems at first rather fail.
    There were Renegade's epics, and Botherby's plays,[615]
    And my own grand romance--

    _Tra_.                     Had its full share of praise.
    I myself saw it puffed in the "Old Girl's Review."[616]

    _Ink_. What Review?

    _Tra_.              Tis the English "Journal de Trevoux;"[617]
    A clerical work of our Jesuits at home.
    Have you never yet seen it?

    _Ink_.                     That pleasure's to come.

    _Tra_. Make haste then.

    _Ink_.                  Why so?

    _Tra_.                         I have heard people say
    That it threatened to give up the _ghost_ t'other day.[618]        130

    _Ink_. Well, that is a sign of some _spirit_.

    _Tra_.                                            No doubt.
    Shall you be at the Countess of Fiddlecome's rout?

    _Ink_. I've a card, and shall go: but at present, as soon
    As friend Scamp shall be pleased to step down from the moon,
    (Where he seems to be soaring in search of his wits),
    And an interval grants from his lecturing fits,
    I'm engaged to the Lady Bluebottle's collation,
    To partake of a luncheon and learn'd conversation:
    'Tis a sort of reunion for Scamp, on the days
    Of his lecture, to treat him with cold tongue and praise.          140
    And I own, for my own part, that 'tis not unpleasant.
    Will you go? There's Miss Lilac will also be present.

    _Tra_. That "metal's attractive."

    _Ink_.                           No doubt--to the pocket.

    _Tra_. You should rather encourage my passion than shock it.
    But let us proceed; for I think by the hum----

    _Ink_. Very true; let us go, then, before they can come,
    Or else we'll be kept here an hour at their levee,
    On the rack of cross questions, by all the blue bevy.
    Hark! Zounds, they'll be on us; I know by the drone
    Of old Botherby's spouting ex-cathedrâ tone.[619]                  150
    Aye! there he is at it. Poor Scamp! better join
    Your friends, or he'll pay you back in your own coin.

    _Tra_. All fair; 'tis but lecture for lecture.

    _Ink_.                                         That's clear.
    But for God's sake let's go, or the Bore will be here.
    Come, come: nay, I'm off.
                                                            [_Exit_ INKEL.

    _Tra_.                     You are right, and I'll follow;
    'Tis high time for a "_Sic me servavit Apollo_."[620]
    And yet we shall have the whole crew on our kibes,[621]
    Blues, dandies, and dowagers, and second-hand scribes,
    All flocking to moisten their exquisite throttles
    With a glass of Madeira[622] at Lady Bluebottle's.                 160
                                                            [_Exit_ TRACY.




                           ECLOGUE THE SECOND.

   _An Apartment in the House of_ LADY BLUEBOTTLE.--_A Table prepared._

                     SIR RICHARD BLUEBOTTLE _solus_.

    Was there ever a man who was married so sorry?
    Like a fool, I must needs do the thing in a hurry.
    My life is reversed, and my quiet destroyed;
    My days, which once passed in so gentle a void,
    Must now, every hour of the twelve, be employed;
    The twelve, do I say?--of the whole twenty-four,
    Is there one which I dare call my own any more?
    What with driving and visiting, dancing and dining,
    What with learning, and teaching, and scribbling, and shining,
    In science and art, I'll be cursed if I know                        10
    Myself from my wife; for although we are two,
    Yet she somehow contrives that all things shall be done
    In a style which proclaims us eternally one.
    But the thing of all things which distresses me more
    Than the bills of the week (though they trouble me sore)
    Is the numerous, humorous, backbiting crew
    Of scribblers, wits, lecturers, white, black, and blue,
    Who are brought to my house as an inn, to my cost--
    For the bill here, it seems, is defrayed by the host--
    No pleasure! no leisure! no thought for my pains,                   20
    But to hear a vile jargon which addles my brains;
    A smatter and chatter, gleaned out of reviews,
    By the rag, tag, and bobtail, of those they call "Blues;"
    A rabble who know not----But soft, here they come!
    Would to God I were deaf! as I'm not, I'll be dumb.

    _Enter_ LADY BLUEBOTTLE, MISS LILAC, LADY BLUEMOUNT, MR. BOTHERBY,
   INKEL, TRACY, MISS MAZARINE, _and others, with_ SCAMP _the Lecturer,
                               etc., etc._

    _Lady Blueb_.
    Ah! Sir Richard, good morning: I've brought you some friends.

    _Sir Rich_. (_bows, and afterwards aside_).
    If friends, they're the first.

    _Lady Blueb_.                 But the luncheon attends.
    I pray ye be seated, "_sans cérémonie_."
    Mr. Scamp, you're fatigued; take your chair there, next me.
                                                          [_They all sit._

    _Sir Rich_. (_aside_). If he does, his fatigue is to come.

    _Lady Blueb_.                                             Mr. Tracy--
    Lady Bluemount--Miss Lilac--be pleased, pray, to place ye;          31
    And you, Mr. Botherby--

    _Both_.                 Oh, my dear Lady,
    I obey.

    _Lady Blueb_. Mr. Inkel, I ought to upbraid ye:
    You were not at the lecture.

    _Ink_.                      Excuse me, I was;
    But the heat forced me out in the best part--alas!
    And when--

    _Lady Blueb_. To be sure it was broiling; but then
    You have lost such a lecture!

    _Both_.                      The best of the ten.

    _Tra_. How can you know that? there are two more.

    _Both_.                                          Because
    I defy him to beat this day's wondrous applause.
    The very walls shook.

    _Ink_.               Oh, if that be the test,                       40
    I allow our friend Scamp has this day done his best.
    Miss Lilac, permit me to help you;--a wing?

    _Miss Lil_. No more, sir, I thank you. Who lectures next spring?

    _Both_. Dick Dunder.

    _Ink_.               That is, if he lives.

    _Miss Lil_.                               And why not?

    _Ink_. No reason whatever, save that he's a sot.
    Lady Bluemount! a glass of Madeira?

    _Lady Bluem_.                      With pleasure.

    _Ink_. How does your friend Wordswords, that Windermere treasure?
    Does he stick to his lakes, like the leeches he sings,[623]
    And their gatherers, as Homer sung warriors and kings?

    _Lady Bluem_. He has just got a place.[624]

    _Ink_.                                 As a footman?

    _Lady Bluem_.                                       For shame!
    Nor profane with your sneers so poetic a name.                      51

    _Ink_. Nay, I meant him no evil, but pitied his master;
    For the poet of pedlers 'twere, sure, no disaster
    To wear a new livery; the more, as 'tis not
    The first time he has turned both his creed and his coat.

    _Lady Bluem_. For shame! I repeat. If Sir George could but hear--

    _Lady Blueb_. Never mind our friend Inkel; we all know, my dear,
    'Tis his way.

    _Sir Rich_.    But this place--

    _Ink_.                          Is perhaps like friend Scamp's,
    A lecturer's.

    _Lady Bluem_. Excuse me--'tis one in the "Stamps:"
    He is made a collector.

    _Tra_.                 Collector!

    _Sir Rich_.                       How?

    _Miss Lil_.                            What?                        60

    _Ink_. I shall think of him oft when I buy a new hat:
    There his works will appear--

    _Lady Bluem_.                Sir, they reach to the Ganges.

    _Ink_. I sha'n't go so far--I can have them at Grange's.[625]

    _Lady Bluem_. Oh fie!

    _Miss Lil_.          And for shame!

    _Lady Bluem_.                      You're too bad.

    _Both_.                                           Very good!

    _Lady Bluem_. How good?

    _Lady Blueb_.          He means nought--'tis his phrase.

    _Lady Bluem_.                                          He grows rude.

    _Lady Blueb_. He means nothing; nay, ask him.

    _Lady Bluem_.                                Pray, Sir! did you mean
    What you say?

    _Ink_.        Never mind if he did; 'twill be seen
    That whatever he means won't alloy what he says.

    _Both_. Sir!

    _Ink_.      Pray be content with your portion of praise;
    'Twas in your defence.

    _Both_.               If you please, with submission                70
    I can make out my own.

    _Ink_.                 It would be your perdition.
    While you live, my dear Botherby, never defend
    Yourself or your works; but leave both to a friend.
    Apropos--Is your play then accepted at last?

    _Both_. At last?

    _Ink_. Why I thought--that's to say--there had passed
    A few green-room whispers, which hinted,--you know
    That the taste of the actors at best is so so.[626]

    _Both_. Sir, the green-room's in rapture, and so's the Committee.

    _Ink_. Aye--yours are the plays for exciting our "pity
    And fear," as the Greek says: for "purging the mind,"80
    I doubt if you'll leave us an equal behind.

    _Both_. I have written the prologue, and meant to have prayed
    For a spice of your wit in an epilogue's aid.

    _Ink_. Well, time enough yet, when the play's to be played.
    Is it cast yet?

    _Both_.         The actors are fighting for parts,
    As is usual in that most litigious of arts.

    _Lady Blueb_. We'll all make a party, and go the _first_ night.

    _Tra_. And you promised the epilogue, Inkel.

    _Ink_.                                       Not quite.
    However, to save my friend Botherby trouble,
    I'll do what I can, though my pains must be double.                 90

    _Tra_. Why so?

    _Ink_.          To do justice to what goes before.

    _Both_. Sir, I'm happy to say, I've no fears on that score.
    Your parts, Mr. Inkel, are----

    _Ink_.                    Never mind _mine_;
    Stick to those of your play, which is quite your own line.

    _Lady Bluem_. You're a fugitive writer, I think, sir, of rhymes?[627]

    _Ink_. Yes, ma'am; and a fugitive reader sometimes.
    On Wordswords, for instance, I seldom alight,
    Or on Mouthey, his friend, without taking to flight.

    _Lady Bluem_. Sir, your taste is too common; but time and posterity
    Will right these great men, and this age's severity                100
    Become its reproach.

    _Ink_.               I've no sort of objection,
    So I'm not of the party to take the infection.

    _Lady Blueb_. Perhaps you have doubts that they ever will _take_?

    _Ink_. Not at all; on the contrary, those of the lake
    Have taken already, and still will continue
    To take--what they can, from a groat to a guinea,
    Of pension or place;--but the subject's a bore.

    _Lady Bluem_. Well, sir, the time's coming.

    _Ink_.                                   Scamp! don't you feel sore?
    What say you to this?

    _Scamp_.             They have merit, I own;
    Though their system's absurdity keeps it unknown,                  110

    _Ink_. Then why not unearth it in one of your lectures?

    _Scamp_. It is only time past which comes under my strictures.

    _Lady Blueb_. Come, a truce with all tartness;--the joy of my heart
    Is to see Nature's triumph o'er all that is art.
    Wild Nature!--Grand Shakespeare!

    _Both_.                         And down Aristotle!

    _Lady Bluem_. Sir George[628] thinks exactly with Lady Bluebottle:
    And my Lord Seventy-four,[629] who protects our dear Bard,
    And who gave him his place, has the greatest regard
    For the poet, who, singing of pedlers and asses,
    Has found out the way to dispense with Parnassus.                  120

    _Tra_. And you, Scamp!--

    _Scamp_.                I needs must confess I'm embarrassed.

    _Ink_. Don't call upon Scamp, who's already so harassed
    With old _schools_, and new _schools_,
                             and no _schools_, and all _schools_[630].

    _Tra_. Well, one thing is certain, that _some_ must be fools.
    I should like to know who.

    _Ink_.                   And I should not be sorry
    To know who are _not_:--it would save us some worry.

    _Lady Blueb_. A truce with remark, and let nothing control
    This "feast of our reason, and flow of the soul."
    Oh! my dear Mr. Botherby! sympathise!--I
    Now feel such a rapture, I'm ready to fly,                         130
    I feel so elastic--"_so buoyant--so buoyant!_"[631]

    _Ink_. Tracy! open the window.

    _Tra_.                         I wish her much joy on't.

    _Both_. For God's sake, my Lady Bluebottle, check not
    This gentle emotion, so seldom our lot
    Upon earth. Give it way: 'tis an impulse which lifts
    Our spirits from earth--the sublimest of gifts;
    For which poor Prometheus was chained to his mountain:
    'Tis the source of all sentiment--feeling's true fountain;
    'Tis the Vision of Heaven upon Earth: 'tis the gas
    Of the soul: 'tis the seizing of shades as they pass,              140
    And making them substance: 'tis something divine:--

    _Ink_. Shall I help you, my friend, to a little more wine?

    _Both_. I thank you: not any more, sir, till I dine.[632]

    _Ink_. Apropos--Do you dine with Sir Humphry to day?

    _Tra_. I should think with _Duke_ Humphry[633] was more in your way.

    _Ink_. It might be of yore; but we authors now look
    To the Knight, as a landlord, much more than the Duke.
    The truth is, each writer now quite at his ease is,
    And (except with his publisher) dines where he pleases.
    But 'tis now nearly five, and I must to the Park.                  150

    _Tra_. And I'll take a turn with you there till 'tis dark.
    And you, Scamp--

    _Scamp_.          Excuse me! I must to my notes,
    For my lecture next week.

    _Ink_. He must mind whom he quotes
    Out of "Elegant Extracts."

    _Lady Blueb_.             Well, now we break up;
    But remember Miss Diddle[634] invites us to sup.

    _Ink_. Then at two hours past midnight we all meet again,
    For the sciences, sandwiches, hock, and champagne!

    _Tra_. And the sweet lobster salad![635]

    _Both_.                               I honour that meal;
    For 'tis then that our feelings most genuinely--feel.

    _Ink_. True; feeling is truest _then_, far beyond question:
    I wish to the gods 'twas the same with digestion!                  161

    _Lady Blueb_. Pshaw!--never mind that; for one moment of feeling
    Is worth--God knows what.

    _Ink_.                  'Tis at least worth concealing
    For itself, or what follows--But here comes your carriage.

    _Sir Rich_. (_aside_).
    I wish all these people were d----d with _my_ marriage!
                                                                [_Exeunt._

                       PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.

The plays and poems contained in this volume were written within the
space of two years--the last two years of Byron's career as a poet. But
that was not all. Cantos VI.-XV. of _Don Juan_, _The Vision of
Judgment_, _The Blues_, _The Irish Avatar_, and other minor poems,
belong to the same period. The end was near, and, as though he had
received a warning, he hastened to make the roll complete.

Proof is impossible, but the impression remains that the greater part of
this volume has been passed over and left unread by at least two
generations of readers. Old play-goers recall Macready as "Werner," and
many persons have read _Cain_; but apart from students of literature,
readers of _Sardanapalus_ and of _The Two Foscari_ are rare; of _The Age
of Bronze_ and _The Island_ rarer still. A few of Byron's later poems
have shared the fate of Southey's epics; and, yet, with something of
Southey's persistence, Byron believed that posterity would weigh his
"regular dramas" in a fresh balance, and that his heedless critics
would kick the beam. But "can these bones live"? Can dramas which
excited the wondering admiration of Goethe and Lamartine and Sir Walter
Scott touch or lay hold of the more adventurous reader of the present
day? It is certain that even the half-forgotten works of a great and
still popular poet, which have left their mark on the creative
imagination of the poets and playwrights of three quarters of a century,
will always be studied by the few from motives of curiosity, or for
purposes of reference; but it is improbable, though not impossible, that
in the revolution of taste and sentiment, moribund or extinct poetry
will be born again into the land of the living. Poetry which has never
had its day, such as Blake's _Songs of Innocence_, the _Lyrical
Ballads_, or Fitzgerald's _Omar Khayyám_, may come, in due time, to be
recognized at its full worth; but it is a harder matter for a poem which
has lost its vogue to recapture the interest and enthusiasm of the many.

Byron is only an instance in point. Bygone poetry has little or no
attraction for modern readers. This poem or that drama may be referred
to, and occasionally examined in the interests of general culture, or in
support of a particular belief or line of conduct, as a classical or
quasi-scriptural authority; but, with the rarest exceptions, plays and
narrative poems are not read spontaneously or with any genuine
satisfaction or delight. An old-world poem which will not yield up its
secret to the idle _reader_ "of an empty day" is more or less "rudely
dismissed," without even a show of favour or hospitality.

And yet these forgotten works of the imagination are full of hidden
treasures! There is not one of Byron's "impressionist studies" of
striking episodes of history or historical legend, flung, as it were,
with a "Take it or leave it" in the face of friend or foe, which does
not transform names and shadows into persons and substance, which does
not contain lines and passages of unquestionable beauty and distinction.

But some would have it that Byron's plays, as a whole, are dull and
uninspiring, monotonous harpings on worn-out themes, which every one has
mastered or wishes to forget. A close study of the text, together with
some knowledge of the subject as it presented itself to the author and
arrested _his_ attention, may compel these impatient critics to a
different conclusion. Byron did not scruple to refer the reader to his
"sources," and was at pains to publish, in the notes and appendices to
his dramas and poems, long extracts from old chronicles, from Plutarch's
_Lives_, from French and Italian histories, which he had read himself,
and, as he fondly believed, would be read by others, who were willing to
submit themselves to his guidance. He expected his readers to take some
trouble and to display some intelligence.

Poetry is successful only so far as it is intelligible. To a clear cry
an answer comes, but not to a muffled call. The reader who comes within
speaking distance of his author can hear him, and to bring the living
within speaking distance of the dead, the living must know the facts,
and understand the ideas which informed and inspired the dead. Thought
and attention are scarcely to be reckoned among necromantic arts, but
thought and knowledge "can make these bones live," and stand upon their
feet, if they do not leap and sing.

I desire to renew my acknowledgments of the generous assistance of the
officials of the British Museum, and, more especially, of Mr. Ernest
Wallis Budge, Litt.D., M.A., _Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian
Antiquities_; of Mr. Leonard W. King, M.A., of the same department; and
of Mr. George F. Barwick, _Superintendent of the Reading Room_.

To Dr. Garnett, C.B., I am greatly indebted for invaluable hints and
suggestions with regard to the interpretation of some obscure passages
in _The Age of Bronze_ and other parts of the volume, and for reading
the proofs of the "Introduction" and "Note to the Introduction to
_Werner_."

I have also to acknowledge the assistance and advice of Mr. W. Hale
White, and of my friend Mr. Frank E. Taylor, of Chertsey.

For assistance during the preparation of the volume, and more especially
in the revision of proofs, I desire to express my cordial thanks to Mr.
John Murray.

[_Sardanapale, Tragédie Imitée de Lord Byron_, par L. Alvin, was
performed at the Théatre Royal at Brussels, January 13, 16, 1834.

_Sardanapalus_, a Tragedy, was played for the first time at Drury Lane
Theatre, April 10, 1834, and (for the twenty-second time) June 5, 1834.
Macready appeared as "Sardanapalus," Miss Phillips as "Zarina," and Miss
Ellen Tree as "Myrrha." [In his diary for April 11, 1834 (see
_Reminiscences_, 1875, i. 414, 415) Macready wrote, "On arriving at my
chambers ... I found a letter without a signature; the seal was the head
of Byron, and in the envelope was a folded sheet with merely the words,
'Werner, Nov., 1830. Byron, Ravenna, 1821,' and 'Sardanapalus, April
10th, 1834.' Encircling the name of Byron, etc., was a lock of grey hair
fastened by a gold thread, which I am sure was Byron's, ... it surprised
and pleased me."]

_Sardanapalus, King of Assyria_, was produced at the Princess's Theatre,
June 13, 1853, and played till September 2, 1853. Charles Kean appeared
as "Sardanapalus," Miss Heath as "Zarina," and Mrs. Charles Kean as
"Myrrha."

_Sardanapale, Opéra en Trois Actes_, par M. Henry Becque, Musique de M.
Victorin Joncières, was performed for the first time at the Théatre
Impérial-Lyrique, February 8, 1867.

_Lord Byron's Tragedy of Sardanapalus_, in four acts, was performed at

(the adapter) played "Sardanapalus," Miss Hathaway "Zarina," and Miss
Fanny Ensor "Myrrha;" and June 26-July 27, 1877, at the Royal Alexandra
Theatre, Liverpool. Calvert's adaptation was also performed at Booth's
Theatre, New York.]




                      INTRODUCTION TO _SARDANAPALUS_


Byron's passion or infatuation for the regular drama lasted a little
over a year. _Marino Faliero_, _Sardanapalus_, and the _Two Foscari_,
were the fruits of his "self-denying ordinance to dramatize, like the
Greeks ... striking passages of history" (letter to Murray, July 14,
1821, _Letters_, 1901, v. 323). The mood was destined to pass, but for a
while the neophyte was spell-bound.

_Sardanapalus, a Tragedy_, the second and, perhaps, the most successful
of these studies in the poetry of history, was begun at Ravenna, January
13, 1821, "with all deliberate speed;" but, for a time, from laziness or
depression of spirits, or, perhaps, from the counter-excitement of "the
poetry of politics" (_Letters_, 1901, v. 205), that is, the
revolutionary drama which had begun to run its course, a month went by
before he had finished the first act (February 15). Three months later
(May 28) he announces the completion of the drama, the last act having
been "dashed off" in two or three days (_Letters_, 1901, v. 300).

For the story of Sardanapalus, which had excited his interest as a
schoolboy, Byron consulted the pages of Diodorus Siculus (_Bibliothecæ
Historicæ_, lib. ii. pp. 78, sq., ed. 1604), and, possibly to ward off
and neutralize the distracting influence of Shakespeare and other
barbarian dramatists, he "turned over" the tragedies of Seneca
(_Letters_, 1901, v. 173). It is hardly necessary to remind the modern
reader that the Sardanapalus of history is an unverified if not an
unverifiable personage. Diodorus the Sicilian, who was contemporary with
Cicero, derived his knowledge of Assyrian history from the _Persica_ of
Ctesias of Cnidos, who was private physician at the court of Artaxerxes
Mnemon (B.C. 405-359), and is said to have had access to, and to have
consulted, the "Persian authorities" (διφθέραι Βασιλικαὶ [diphthe/rai
Basilikai\]).

The character which Ctesias depicted or invented, an effeminate
debauchee, sunk in luxury and sloth, who at the last was driven to take
up arms, and, after a prolonged but ineffectual resistance, avoided
capture by suicide, cannot be identified. Asurbanipal
(Ašur-bāni-apli), the son of Esarhaddon and grandson of
Sennacherib, who ascended the throne B.C. 668, and reigned for about
forty years, was, as the cuneiform records and the friezes of his palace
testify, a bold hunter and a mighty warrior. He vanquished Tarkū
(Tirhakah) of Ethiopia, and his successor, Urdamanē. Ba'al King of Tyre,
Yakinlū King of the island-city of Arvad, Sandăsarmū of Cilicia,
Teumman of Elam, and other potentates, suffered defeat at his hands.
"The land of Elam," writes the king or his "Historiographer Royal,"
"through its extent I covered as when a mighty storm approaches; I cut
off the head of Teumman, their king... Beyond number I slew his
warriors; alive in my hands I took his fighting men; with their corpses,
as with thorns and thistles, I filled the vicinity of Susa; their blood
I caused to flow in the Eulæus, and I stained its waters like wool."
Clearly the Sardanapalus who painted his face and carded purple wool in
the _penetralia_ of his seraglio does not bear even a traditional
resemblance to Ašur-bāni-apli the Conqueror.

All that can be affirmed with any certainty is that within twenty years
of the death of Asurbanipal, the Assyrian Empire passed into the hands
of the Medes;[1] but there is nothing to show whether the period of
decay had already set in before the close of his reign, or under which
of his two successors, Ăsur-etil-ilāni or Sin-šar-iškun,
the final catastrophe (B.C. 606) took place (_Encyclopedia Biblica_,
art. "Assyria," art. "Ăsur-bani-pal," by Leonard W. King).

"I have made," writes Byron (May 25, 1821), "Sardanapalus brave though
voluptuous (as history represents him), and as amiable as my poor pen
could make him." Diodorus, or rather Ctesias, who may have drawn upon
personal reminiscences of his patron, Artaxerxes Mnemon (see Plutarch's
_Artaxerxes_, _passim_), does not enlarge upon his amiability, and
credits him only with the courage of despair. Byron's Sardanapalus, with
his sudden transition from voluptuous abandonment to heroic chivalry,
his remorseful recognition of the sanctities of wedlock, his general
good nature, his "sly, insinuating sarcasms" (Moore's Diary, September
30, 1821, _Memoirs_, iii. 282), "all made out of the carver's brain,"
resembles _history_ as little as _history_ resembles the Assyrian
record. Fortunately, the genius of the poet escaped from the meshes
which he had woven round himself, and, in spite of himself, he was
constrained to "beat his music out," regardless of his authorities.

The character of Myrrha, which bears some resemblance to Aspasia, "a
native of Phocea in Ionia--the favourite mistress of Cyrus" (see
Plutarch's _Artaxerxes_, Langhorne's Translation, 1838, p. 699), was
introduced partly to pacify the Countess Guiccioli, who had quarrelled
with him for maintaining that "love was not the loftiest theme for true
tragedy," and, in part, to prove that he was not a slave to his own
ideals, and could imagine and delineate a woman who was both passionate
and high-minded. Diodorus (_Bibl. Hist._, lib. iii. p. 130) records the
exploits of Myrina, Queen of the Amazons, but it is probable that Byron
named his Ionian slave after Mirra, who gives her name to Alfieri's
tragedy, which brought on a convulsive fit of tears and shuddering when
he first saw it played at Bologna in August, 1819 (_Letters_, 1900, iv.
339).

_Sardanapalus, a Tragedy_, was published together with _The Two Foscari,
a Tragedy_, and _Cain, a Mystery_, December 19, 1821.

The three plays were reviewed by Heber in the _Quarterly Review_, July,
1822, vol. xxvii. pp. 476-524; by Jeffrey in the _Edinburgh Review_,
February, 1822, vol. 36, pp. 413-452; in _Blackwood's Edinburgh
Magazine_, February, 1822, vol. xi. pp. 212-217; and in the _Portfolio_
(Philadelphia), December, 1822, vol. xiv. pp. 487-492.

                                 PREFACE

In publishing the following Tragedies[3] I have only to repeat, that
they were not composed with the most remote view to the stage. On the
attempt made by the managers in a former instance, the public opinion
has been already expressed. With regard to my own private feelings, as
it seems that they are to stand for nothing, I shall say nothing.

For the historical foundation of the following compositions the reader
is referred to the Notes.

The Author has in one instance attempted to preserve, and in the other
to approach, the "unities;" conceiving that with any very distant
departure from them, there may be poetry, but can be no drama. He is
aware of the unpopularity of this notion in present English literature;
but it is not a system of his own, being merely an opinion, which, not
very long ago, was the law of literature throughout the world, and is
still so in the more civilised parts of it. But "nous avons changé tout
cela," and are reaping the advantages of the change. The writer is far
from conceiving that any thing he can adduce by personal precept or
example can at all approach his regular, or even irregular predecessors:
he is merely giving a reason why he preferred the more regular formation
of a structure, however feeble, to an entire abandonment of all rules
whatsoever. Where he has failed, the failure is in the architect,--and
not in the art.

In this tragedy it has been my intention to follow the account of
Diodorus Siculus;[4] reducing it, however, to such dramatic regularity
as I best could, and trying to approach the unities. I therefore suppose
the rebellion to explode and succeed in one day by a sudden conspiracy,
instead of the long war of the history.

    _Salemenes_ (_solus_).
    He hath wronged his queen, but still he is her lord;
    He hath wronged my sister--still he is my brother;
    He hath wronged his people--still he is their sovereign--
    And I must be his friend as well as subject:
    He must not perish thus. I will not see
    The blood of Nimrod and Semiramis
    Sink in the earth, and thirteen hundred years
    Of Empire ending like a shepherd's tale;
    He must be roused. In his effeminate heart
    There is a careless courage which Corruption                        10
    Has not all quenched, and latent energies,
    Repressed by circumstance, but not destroyed--
    Steeped, but not drowned, in deep voluptuousness.
    If born a peasant, he had been a man
    To have reached an empire: to an empire born,
    He will bequeath none; nothing but a name,
    Which his sons will not prize in heritage:--
    Yet--not all lost--even yet--he may redeem
    His sloth and shame, by only being that
    Which he should be, as easily as the thing                          20
    He should not be and is. Were it less toil
    To sway his nations than consume his life?
    To head an army than to rule a harem?
    He sweats in palling pleasures, dulls his soul,[a]
    And saps his goodly strength, in toils which yield not
    Health like the chase, nor glory like the war--
    He must be roused. Alas! there is no sound
                                 [_Sound of soft music heard from within_.
    To rouse him short of thunder. Hark! the lute--
    The lyre--the timbrel; the lascivious tinklings
    Of lulling instruments, the softening voices                        30
    Of women, and of beings less than women,
    Must chime in to the echo of his revel,
    While the great King of all we know of earth
    Lolls crowned with roses, and his diadem
    Lies negligently by to be caught up
    By the first manly hand which dares to snatch it.
    Lo, where they come! already I perceive
    The reeking odours of the perfumed trains,
    And see the bright gems of the glittering girls,[b]
    At once his Chorus and his Council, flash                           40
    Along the gallery, and amidst the damsels,
    As femininely garbed, and scarce less female,
    The grandson of Semiramis, the Man-Queen.--
    He comes! Shall I await him? yes, and front him,
    And tell him what all good men tell each other,
    Speaking of him and his. They come, the slaves
    Led by the monarch subject to his slaves.


                                SCENE II.

           _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _effeminately dressed, his Head
         crowned with Flowers, and his Robe negligently flowing,
             attended by a Train of Women and young Slaves_.

    _Sar._ (_speaking to some of his attendants_).
    Let the pavilion[6] over the Euphrates
    Be garlanded, and lit, and furnished forth
    For an especial banquet; at the hour
    Of midnight we will sup there: see nought wanting,
    And bid the galley be prepared. There is
    A cooling breeze which crisps the broad clear river:
    We will embark anon. Fair Nymphs, who deign
    To share the soft hours of Sardanapalus,
    We'll meet again in that the sweetest hour,
    When we shall gather like the stars above us,                       10
    And you will form a heaven as bright as theirs;
    Till then, let each be mistress of her time,
    And thou, my own Ionian Myrrha,[7] choose;
    Wilt thou along with them or me?

    _Myr._                          My Lord--

    _Sar._ My Lord!--my Life! why answerest thou so coldly?
    It is the curse of kings to be so answered.
    Rule thy own hours, thou rulest mine--say, wouldst thou
    Accompany our guests, or charm away
    The moments from me?

    _Myr._              The King's choice is mine.

    _Sar._ I pray thee say not so: my chiefest joy                      20
    Is to contribute to thine every wish.
    I do not dare to breathe my own desire,
    Lest it should clash with thine; for thou art still
    Too prompt to sacrifice thy thoughts for others.

    _Myr._ I would remain: I have no happiness
    Save in beholding thine; yet--

    _Sar._                         Yet! what YET?
    Thy own sweet will shall be the only barrier
    Which ever rises betwixt thee and me.

    _Myr._ I think the present is the wonted hour
    Of council; it were better I retire.                                30

    _Sal._ (_comes forward and says_)
    The Ionian slave says well: let her retire.

    _Sar._ Who answers? How now, brother?

    _Sal._                               The _Queen's_ brother,
    And your most faithful vassal, royal Lord.

    _Sar._ (_addressing his train_).
    As I have said, let all dispose their hours
    Till midnight, when again we pray your presence.
                                                    [_The court retiring_.
    (_To_ MYRRHA,[c] _who is going_.)
    Myrrha! I thought _thou_ wouldst remain.

    _Myr._                                  Great King,
    Thou didst not say so.

    _Sar._                 But _thou_ looked'st it:
    I know each glance of those Ionic eyes,[d]
    Which said thou wouldst not leave me.

    _Myr._                               Sire! your brother----

    _Sal._ His _Consort's_ brother, minion of Ionia!                    40
    How darest _thou_ name _me_ and not blush?

    _Sar._                                    Not blush!
    Thou hast no more eyes than heart to make her crimson
    Like to the dying day on Caucasus,
    Where sunset tints the snow with rosy shadows,
    And then reproach her with thine own cold blindness,
    Which will not see it. What! in tears, my Myrrha?

    _Sal._ Let them flow on; she weeps for more than one,
    And is herself the cause of bitterer tears.

    _Sar._ Curséd be he who caused those tears to flow!

    _Sal._ Curse not thyself--millions do that already.                 50

    _Sar._ Thou dost forget thee: make me not remember
    I am a monarch.

    _Sal._          Would thou couldst!

    _Myr._                               My sovereign,
    I pray, and thou, too, Prince, permit my absence.

    _Sar._ Since it must be so, and this churl has checked
    Thy gentle spirit, go; but recollect
    That we must forthwith meet: I had rather lose
    An empire than thy presence.                           [_Exit_ MYRRHA.

    _Sal._                       It may be,
    Thou wilt lose both--and both for ever!

    _Sar._                                  Brother!
    I can at least command myself, who listen
    To language such as this: yet urge me not                           60
    Beyond my easy nature.

    _Sal._                 'Tis beyond
    That easy--far too easy--idle nature,
    Which I would urge thee. O that I could rouse thee!
    Though 'twere against myself.

    _Sar._                        By the god Baal!
    The man would make me tyrant.

    _Sal._                        So thou art.
    Think'st thou there is no tyranny but that
    Of blood and chains? The despotism of vice,
    The weakness and the wickedness of luxury,
    The negligence, the apathy, the evils
    Of sensual sloth--produce ten thousand tyrants,                     70
    Whose delegated cruelty surpasses
    The worst acts of one energetic master,
    However harsh and hard in his own bearing.
    The false and fond examples of thy lusts
    Corrupt no less than they oppress, and sap
    In the same moment all thy pageant power
    And those who should sustain it; so that whether
    A foreign foe invade, or civil broil
    Distract within, both will alike prove fatal:
    The first thy subjects have no heart to conquer;                    80
    The last they rather would assist than vanquish.

    _Sar._ Why, what makes thee the mouth-piece of the people?

    _Sal._ Forgiveness of the Queen, my sister wrongs;
    A natural love unto my infant nephews;
    Faith to the King, a faith he may need shortly,
    In more than words; respect for Nimrod's line;
    Also, another thing thou knowest not.

    _Sar._ What's that?

    _Sal._               To thee an unknown word.

    _Sar._                                        Yet speak it;
    I love to learn.

    _Sal._           Virtue.

    _Sar._                  Not know the word!
    Never was word yet rung so in my ears--                             90
    Worse than the rabble's shout, or splitting trumpet:
    I've heard thy sister talk of nothing else.

    _Sal._ To change the irksome theme, then, hear of vice.

    _Sar._ From whom?

    _Sal._             Even from the winds, if thou couldst listen
    Unto the echoes of the Nation's voice.

    _Sar._ Come, I'm indulgent, as thou knowest, patient,
    As thou hast often proved--speak out, what moves thee?

    _Sal._ Thy peril.

    _Sar._             Say on.

    _Sal._                     Thus, then: all the nations,
    For they are many, whom thy father left
    In heritage, are loud in wrath against thee.                       100

    _Sar._ 'Gainst _me!!_ What would the slaves?

    _Sal._                                         A king.

    _Sar._                                                 And what
    Am I then?

    _Sal._     In their eyes a nothing; but
    In mine a man who might be something still.

    _Sar._ The railing drunkards! why, what would they have?
    Have they not peace and plenty?

    _Sal._                          Of the first
    More than is glorious: of the last, far less
    Than the King recks of.

    _Sar._                  Whose then is the crime,
    But the false satraps, who provide no better?

    _Sal._ And somewhat in the Monarch who ne'er looks
    Beyond his palace walls, or if he stirs                            110
    Beyond them, 'tis but to some mountain palace,
    Till summer heats wear down. O glorious Baal!
    Who built up this vast empire, and wert made
    A God, or at the least shinest like a God
    Through the long centuries of thy renown,
    This, thy presumed descendant, ne'er beheld
    As king the kingdoms thou didst leave as hero,
    Won with thy blood, and toil, and time, and peril!
    For what? to furnish imposts for a revel,
    Or multiplied extortions for a minion.                             120

    _Sar._ I understand thee--thou wouldst have me go
    Forth as a conqueror. By all the stars
    Which the Chaldeans read--the restless slaves[e]
    Deserve that I should curse them with their wishes,
    And lead them forth to glory.

    _Sal._                       Wherefore not?
    Semiramis--a woman only--led
    These our Assyrians to the solar shores
    Of Ganges.

    _Sar._    Tis most true. And _how_ returned?

    _Sal._ Why, like a _man_--a hero; baffled, but
    Not vanquished. With but twenty guards, she made                   130
    Good her retreat to Bactria.

    _Sar._                       And how many
    Left she behind in India to the vultures?

    _Sal._ Our annals say not.

    _Sar._                    Then I will say for them--
    That she had better woven within her palace
    Some twenty garments, than with twenty guards
    Have fled to Bactria, leaving to the ravens,
    And wolves, and men--the fiercer of the three,
    Her myriads of fond subjects. Is _this_ Glory?
    Then let me live in ignominy ever.

    _Sal._ All warlike spirits have not the same fate.                 140
    Semiramis, the glorious parent of
    A hundred kings, although she failed in India,
    Brought Persia--Media--Bactria--to the realm
    Which she once swayed--and thou _mightst_ sway.

    _Sar._                                         _I sway_ them--
    She but subdued them.

    _Sal._                It may be ere long
    That they will need her sword more than your sceptre.

    _Sar._ There was a certain Bacchus, was there not?
    I've heard my Greek girls speak of such--they say
    He was a God, that is, a Grecian god,
    An idol foreign to Assyria's worship,                              150
    Who conquered this same golden realm of Ind
    Thou prat'st of, where Semiramis was vanquished.

    _Sal._ I have heard of such a man; and thou perceiv'st
    That he is deemed a God for what he did.

    _Sar._ And in his godship I will honour him--
    Not much as man. What, ho! my cupbearer!

    _Sal._ What means the King?

    _Sar._                     To worship your new God
    And ancient conqueror. Some wine, I say.

                            _Enter Cupbearer_.

    _Sar._ (_addressing the Cupbearer_).
    Bring me the golden goblet thick with gems,
    Which bears the name of Nimrod's chalice. Hence,                   160
    Fill full, and bear it quickly.                     [_Exit Cupbearer_.

    _Sal._                         Is this moment
    A fitting one for the resumption of
    Thy yet unslept-off revels?

                     _Re-enter Cupbearer, with wine_.

    _Sar._ (_taking the cup from him_). Noble kinsman,
    If these barbarian Greeks of the far shores
    And skirts of these our realms lie not, this Bacchus
    Conquered the whole of India,[8] did he not?

    _Sal._ He did, and thence was deemed a Deity.[f]

    _Sar._ Not so:--of all his conquests a few columns.[9]
    Which may be his, and might be mine, if I
    Thought them worth purchase and conveyance, are                    170
    The landmarks of the seas of gore he shed,
    The realms he wasted, and the hearts he broke.
    But here--here in this goblet is his title
    To immortality--the immortal grape
    From which he first expressed the soul, and gave
    To gladden that of man, as some atonement
    For the victorious mischiefs he had done.
    Had it not been for this, he would have been
    A mortal still in name as in his grave;
    And, like my ancestor Semiramis,                                   180
    A sort of semi-glorious human monster.
    Here's that which deified him--let it now
    Humanise thee; my surly, chiding brother,
    Pledge me to the Greek God!

    _Sal._                      For all thy realms
    I would not so blaspheme our country's creed.

    _Sar._ That is to say, thou thinkest him a hero,
    That he shed blood by oceans; and no God,
    Because he turned a fruit to an enchantment,
    Which cheers the sad, revives the old, inspires
    The young, makes Weariness forget his toil,                        190
    And Fear her danger; opens a new world
    When this, the present, palls. Well, then _I_ pledge thee
    And _him_ as a true man, who did his utmost
    In good or evil to surprise mankind.                        [_Drinks_.

    _Sal._ Wilt thou resume a revel at this hour?

    _Sar._ And if I did, 'twere better than a trophy,
    Being bought without a tear. But that is not
    My present purpose: since thou wilt not pledge me,
    Continue what thou pleasest.
    (_To the Cupbearer_.)       Boy, retire.            [_Exit Cupbearer_.

    _Sal._ I would but have recalled thee from thy dream;              200
    Better by me awakened than rebellion.

    _Sar._ Who should rebel? or why? what cause? pretext?
    I am the lawful King, descended from
    A race of Kings who knew no predecessors.
    What have I done to thee, or to the people,
    That thou shouldst rail, or they rise up against me?

    _Sal._ Of what thou hast done to me, I speak not.

    _Sar._                                             But
    Thou think'st that I have wronged the Queen: is't not so?

    _Sal._ _Think!_ Thou hast wronged her!

    _Sar._                                Patience, Prince, and hear me.
    She has all power and splendour of her station,                    210
    Respect, the tutelage of Assyria's heirs,
    The homage and the appanage of sovereignty.
    I married her as monarchs wed--for state,
    And loved her as most husbands love their wives.
    If she or thou supposedst I could link me
    Like a Chaldean peasant to his mate,
    Ye knew nor me--nor monarchs--nor mankind.

    _Sal._ I pray thee, change the theme: my blood disdains
    Complaint, and Salemenes' sister seeks not
    Reluctant love even from Assyria's lord!                           220
    Nor would she deign to accept divided passion
    With foreign strumpets and Ionian slaves.
    The Queen is silent.

    _Sar._               And why not her brother?

    _Sal._ I only echo thee the voice of empires,
    Which he who long neglects not long will govern.

    _Sar._ The ungrateful and ungracious slaves! they murmur
    Because I have not shed their blood, nor led them
    To dry into the desert's dust by myriads,
    Or whiten with their bones the banks of Ganges;
    Nor decimated them with savage laws,                               230
    Nor sweated them to build up Pyramids,
    Or Babylonian walls.

    _Sal._               Yet these are trophies
    More worthy of a people and their prince
    Than songs, and lutes, and feasts, and concubines,
    And lavished treasures, and contemnéd virtues.

    _Sar._ Or for my trophies I have founded cities:
    There's Tarsus and Anchialus, both built
    In one day--what could that blood-loving beldame,
    My martial grandam, chaste Semiramis,
    Do more, except destroy them?

    _Sal._                        'Tis most true;                      240
    I own thy merit in those founded cities,
    Built for a whim, recorded with a verse
    Which shames both them and thee to coming ages.

    _Sar._ Shame me! By Baal, the cities, though well built,
    Are not more goodly than the verse! Say what
    Thou wilt 'gainst me, my mode of life or rule,
    But nothing 'gainst the truth of that brief record.
    Why, those few lines contain the history
    Of all things human: hear--"Sardanapalus,
    The king, and son of Anacyndaraxes,                                250
    In one day built Anchialus and Tarsus.
    Eat, drink, and love; the rest's not worth a fillip."[10]

    _Sal._ A worthy moral, and a wise inscription,
    For a king to put up before his subjects!

    _Sar._ Oh, thou wouldst have me doubtless set up edicts--
    "Obey the king--contribute to his treasure--
    Recruit his phalanx--spill your blood at bidding--
    Fall down and worship, or get up and toil."
    Or thus--"Sardanapalus on this spot
    Slew fifty thousand of his enemies.                                260
    These are their sepulchres, and this his trophy."
    I leave such things to conquerors; enough
    For me, if I can make my subjects feel
    The weight of human misery less, and glide
    Ungroaning to the tomb: I take no license
    Which I deny to them. We all are men.

    _Sal._ Thy Sires have been revered as Gods--

    _Sar._                                        In dust
    And death, where they are neither Gods nor men.
    Talk not of such to me! the worms are Gods;[11]
    At least they banqueted upon your Gods,                            270
    And died for lack of farther nutriment.
    Those Gods were merely men; look to their issue--
    I feel a thousand mortal things about me,
    But nothing godlike,--unless it may be
    The thing which you condemn, a disposition
    To love and to be merciful, to pardon
    The follies of my species, and (that's human)
    To be indulgent to my own.

    _Sal._                    Alas!
    The doom of Nineveh is sealed.--Woe--woe
    To the unrivalled city!

    _Sar._                  What dost dread?                           280

    _Sal._ Thou art guarded by thy foes: in a few hours
    The tempest may break out which overwhelms thee,
    And thine and mine; and in another day
    What _is_ shall be the past of Belus' race.

    _Sar._ What must we dread?

    _Sal._                    Ambitious treachery,
    Which has environed thee with snares; but yet
    There is resource: empower me with thy signet
    To quell the machinations, and I lay
    The heads of thy chief foes before thy feet.

    _Sar._ The heads--how many?

    _Sal._                     Must I stay to number             290
    When even thine own's in peril? Let me go;
    Give me thy signet--trust me with the rest.

    _Sar._ I will trust no man with unlimited lives.
    When we take those from others, we nor know
    What we have taken, nor the thing we give.

    _Sal._ Wouldst thou not take their lives who seek for thine?

    _Sar._ That's a hard question--But I answer, Yes.
    Cannot the thing be done without? Who are they
    Whom thou suspectest?--Let them be arrested.

    _Sal._ I would thou wouldst not ask me; the next moment            300
    Will send my answer through thy babbling troop
    Of paramours, and thence fly o'er the palace,
    Even to the city, and so baffle all.--
    Trust me.

    _Sar._      Thou knowest I have done so ever;
    Take thou the signet.                             [_Gives the signet_.

    _Sal._                I have one more request.

    _Sar._ Name it.

    _Sal._           That thou this night forbear the banquet
    In the pavilion over the Euphrates.

    _Sar._ Forbear the banquet! Not for all the plotters
    That ever shook a kingdom! Let them come,
    And do their worst: I shall not blench for them;                   310
    Nor rise the sooner; nor forbear the goblet;
    Nor crown me with a single rose the less;
    Nor lose one joyous hour.--I fear them not.

    _Sal._ But thou wouldst arm thee, wouldst thou not, if needful?

    _Sar._ Perhaps. I have the goodliest armour, and
    A sword of such a temper, and a bow,
    And javelin, which might furnish Nimrod forth:
    A little heavy, but yet not unwieldy.
    And now I think on't, 'tis long since I've used them,
    Even in the chase. Hast ever seen them, brother?                   320

    _Sal._ Is this a time for such fantastic trifling?--
    If need be, wilt thou wear them?

    _Sar._                           Will I not?
    Oh! if it must be so, and these rash slaves
    Will not be ruled with less, I'll use the sword
    Till they shall wish it turned into a distaff.

    _Sal._ They say thy Sceptre's turned to that already.

    _Sar._ That's false! but let them say so: the old Greeks,
    Of whom our captives often sing, related
    The same of their chief hero, Hercules,
    Because he loved a Lydian queen: thou seest                        330
    The populace of all the nations seize
    Each calumny they can to sink their sovereigns.

    _Sal._ They did not speak thus of thy fathers.

    _Sar._                                         No;
    They dared not. They were kept to toil and combat;
    And never changed their chains but for their armour:
    Now they have peace and pastime, and the license
    To revel and to rail; it irks me not.
    I would not give the smile of one fair girl
    For all the popular breath[12] that e'er divided
    A name from nothing. What are the rank tongues[13]                 340
    Of this vile herd, grown insolent with feeding,
    That I should prize their noisy praise, or dread
    Their noisome clamour?

    _Sal._                You have said they are men;
    As such their hearts are something.

    _Sar._                             So my dogs' are;
    And better, as more faithful:--but, proceed;
    Thou hast my signet:--since they are tumultuous,
    Let them be tempered, yet not roughly, till
    Necessity enforce it. I hate all pain,
    Given or received; we have enough within us,
    The meanest vassal as the loftiest monarch,                        350
    Not to add to each other's natural burthen
    Of mortal misery, but rather lessen,
    By mild reciprocal alleviation,
    The fatal penalties imposed on life:
    But this they know not, or they will not know.
    I have, by Baal! done all I could to soothe them:
    I made no wars, I added no new imposts,
    I interfered not with their civic lives,
    I let them pass their days as best might suit them,
    Passing my own as suited me.

    _Sal._                       Thou stopp'st                         360
    Short of the duties of a king; and therefore
    They say thou art unfit to be a monarch.

    _Sar._ They lie.--Unhappily, I am unfit
    To be aught save a monarch; else for me
    The meanest Mede might be the king instead.

    _Sal._ There is one Mede, at least, who seeks to be so.

    _Sar._ What mean'st thou!--'tis thy secret; thou desirest
    Few questions, and I'm not of curious nature.
    Take the fit steps; and, since necessity
    Requires, I sanction and support thee. Ne'er                       370
    Was man who more desired to rule in peace
    The peaceful only: if they rouse me, better
    They had conjured up stern Nimrod from his ashes,
    "The Mighty Hunter!" I will turn these realms
    To one wide desert chase of brutes, who _were_,
    But _would_ no more, by their own choice, be human.
    _What_ they have found me, they belie; _that which_
    They yet may find me--shall defy their wish
    To speak it worse; and let them thank themselves.

    _Sal._ Then thou at last canst feel?

    _Sar._                              Feel! who feels not            380
    Ingratitude?[14]

    _Sal._      I will not pause to answer
    With words, but deeds. Keep thou awake that energy
    Which sleeps at times, but is not dead within thee,
    And thou may'st yet be glorious in thy reign,
    As powerful in thy realm. Farewell!                 [_Exit_ SALEMENES.

    _Sar._ (_solus_).                 Farewell!
    He's gone; and on his finger bears my signet,
    Which is to him a sceptre. He is stern
    As I am heedless; and the slaves deserve
    To feel a master. What may be the danger,
    I know not: he hath found it, let him quell it.                    390
    Must I consume my life--this little life--
    In guarding against all may make it less?
    It is not worth so much! It were to die
    Before my hour, to live in dread of death,
    Tracing revolt; suspecting all about me,
    Because they are near; and all who are remote,
    Because they are far. But if it should be so--
    If they should sweep me off from Earth and Empire,
    Why, what is Earth or Empire of the Earth?
    I have loved, and lived, and multiplied my image;                  400
    To die is no less natural than those
    Acts of this clay! 'Tis true I have not shed
    Blood as I might have done, in oceans, till
    My name became the synonyme of Death--
    A terror and a trophy. But for this
    I feel no penitence; my life is love:
    If I must shed blood, it shall be by force.
    Till now, no drop from an Assyrian vein
    Hath flowed for me, nor hath the smallest coin
    Of Nineveh's vast treasures e'er been lavished                     410
    On objects which could cost her sons a tear:
    If then they hate me, 'tis because I hate not:
    If they rebel, 'tis because I oppress not.
    Oh, men! ye must be ruled with scythes, not sceptres,
    And mowed down like the grass, else all we reap
    Is rank abundance, and a rotten harvest
    Of discontents infecting the fair soil,
    Making a desert of fertility.--
    I'll think no more.--Within there, ho!

                          _Enter an_ ATTENDANT.

    _Sar._                                Slave, tell
    The Ionian Myrrha we would crave her presence.                     420

    _Attend._ King, she is here.

                             MYRRHA _enters_.

    _Sar._ (_apart to Attendant_). Away!

    (_Addressing_ MYRRHA.)              Beautiful being!
    Thou dost almost anticipate my heart;
    It throbbed for thee, and here thou comest: let me
    Deem that some unknown influence, some sweet oracle,
    Communicates between us, though unseen,
    In absence, and attracts us to each other.

    _Myr._ There doth.

    _Sar._             I know there doth, but not its name:
    What is it?

    _Myr._       In my native land a God,
    And in my heart a feeling like a God's,
    Exalted; yet I own 'tis only mortal;                               430
    For what I feel is humble, and yet happy--
    That is, it would be happy; but----                  [MYRRHA _pauses_.

    _Sar._                             There comes
    For ever something between us and what
    We deem our happiness: let me remove
    The barrier which that hesitating accent
    Proclaims to thine, and mine is sealed.

    _Myr._                                  My Lord!--

    _Sar._ My Lord--my King--Sire--Sovereign; thus it is--
    For ever thus, addressed with awe. I ne'er
    Can see a smile, unless in some broad banquet's
    Intoxicating glare, when the buffoons                              440
    Have gorged themselves up to equality,
    Or I have quaffed me down to their abasement.
    Myrrha, I can hear all these things, these names,
    Lord--King--Sire--Monarch--nay, time was I prized them;
    That is, I suffered them--from slaves and nobles;
    But when they falter from the lips I love,
    The lips which have been pressed to mine, a chill
    Comes o'er my heart, a cold sense of the falsehood
    Of this my station, which represses feeling
    In those for whom I have felt most, and makes me                   450
    Wish that I could lay down the dull tiara,
    And share a cottage on the Caucasus
    With thee--and wear no crowns but those of flowers.

    _Myr._ Would that we could!

    _Sar._                     And dost _thou_ feel this?--Why?

    _Myr._ Then thou wouldst know what thou canst never know.

    _Sar._ And that is----

    _Myr._                  The true value of a heart;
    At least, a woman's.

    _Sar._               I have proved a thousand--A
    thousand, and a thousand.

    _Myr._                   Hearts?

    _Sar._                          I think so.

    _Myr._ Not one! the time may come thou may'st.

    _Sar._                                          It will.
    Hear, Myrrha; Salemenes has declared--                             460
    Or why or how he hath divined it, Belus,
    Who founded our great realm, knows more than I--
    But Salemenes hath declared my throne
    In peril.

    _Myr._    He did well.

    _Sar._                And say'st _thou_ so?
    Thou whom he spurned so harshly, and now dared[g]
    Drive from our presence with his savage jeers,
    And made thee weep and blush?

    _Myr._                        I should do both
    More frequently, and he did well to call me
    Back to my duty. But thou spakest of peril
    Peril to thee----

    _Sar._            Aye, from dark plots and snares                  470
    From Medes--and discontented troops and nations.
    I know not what--a labyrinth of things--
    A maze of muttered threats and mysteries:
    Thou know'st the man--it is his usual custom.
    But he is honest. Come, we'll think no more on't--
    But of the midnight festival.

    _Myr._                       'Tis time
    To think of aught save festivals. Thou hast not
    Spurned his sage cautions?

    _Sar._                     What?--and dost thou fear?

    _Myr._ Fear!--I'm a Greek, and how should I fear death?
    A slave, and wherefore should I dread my freedom?                  480

    _Sar._ Then wherefore dost thou turn so pale?

    _Myr._                                         I love.

    _Sar._ And do not I? I love thee far--far more
    Than either the brief life or the wide realm,
    Which, it may be, are menaced;--yet I blench not.

    _Myr._ That means thou lovest nor thyself nor me;
    For he who loves another loves himself,
    Even for that other's sake. This is too rash:
    Kingdoms and lives are not to be so lost.

    _Sar._ Lost!--why, who is the aspiring chief who dared
    Assume to win them?

    _Myr._             Who is he should dread                          490
    To try so much? When he who is their ruler
    Forgets himself--will they remember him?

    _Sar._ Myrrha!

    _Myr._        Frown not upon me: you have smiled
    Too often on me not to make those frowns
    Bitterer to bear than any punishment
    Which they may augur.--King, I am your subject!
    Master, I am your slave! Man, I have loved you!--
    Loved you, I know not by what fatal weakness,
    Although a Greek, and born a foe to monarchs--
    A slave, and hating fetters--an Ionian,                            500
    And, therefore, when I love a stranger, more
    Degraded by that passion than by chains!
    Still I have loved you. If that love were strong
    Enough to overcome all former nature,
    Shall it not claim the privilege to save you?

    _Sar._ _Save_ me, my beauty! Thou art very fair,
    And what I seek of thee is love--not safety.

    _Myr._ And without love where dwells security?

    _Sar._ I speak of woman's love.

    _Myr._                         The very first
    Of human life must spring from woman's breast,                     510
    Your first small words are taught you from her lips,
    Your first tears quenched by her, and your last sighs
    Too often breathed out in a woman's hearing,
    When men have shrunk from the ignoble care
    Of watching the last hour of him who led them.

    _Sar._ My eloquent Ionian! thou speak'st music:
    The very chorus of the tragic song
    I have heard thee talk of as the favourite pastime
    Of thy far father-land. Nay, weep not--calm thee.

    _Myr._ I weep not.--But I pray thee, do not speak                  520
    About my fathers or their land.

    _Sar._                          Yet oft
    Thou speakest of them.

    _Myr._                 True--true: constant thought
    Will overflow in words unconsciously;
    But when another speaks of Greeks, it wounds me.

    _Sar._ Well, then, how wouldst thou _save_ me, as thou saidst?

    _Myr._ By teaching thee to save thyself, and not
    Thyself alone, but these vast realms, from all
    The rage of the worst war--the war of brethren.

    _Sar._ Why, child, I loathe all war, and warriors;
    I live in peace and pleasure: what can man                         530
    Do more?

    _Myr._       Alas! my Lord, with common men
    There needs too oft the show of war to keep
    The substance of sweet peace; and, for a king,
    'Tis sometimes better to be feared than loved.

    _Sar._ And I have never sought but for the last.

    _Myr._ And now art neither.

    _Sar._                      Dost _thou_ say so, Myrrha?

    _Myr._ I speak of civic popular love, _self_-love,
    Which means that men are kept in awe and law,
    Yet not oppressed--at least they must not think so,
    Or, if they think so, deem it necessary,                           540
    To ward off worse oppression, their own passions.
    A King of feasts, and flowers, and wine, and revel,
    And love, and mirth, was never King of Glory.

    _Sar._ Glory! what's that?

    _Myr._                     Ask of the Gods thy fathers.

    _Sar._ They cannot answer; when the priests speak for them,
    'Tis for some small addition to the temple.

    _Myr._ Look to the annals of thine Empire's founders.

    _Sar._ They are so blotted o'er with blood, I cannot.
    But what wouldst have? the Empire _has been_ founded.
    I cannot go on multiplying empires.                                550

    _Myr._ Preserve thine own.

    _Sar._                     At least, I will enjoy it.
    Come, Myrrha, let us go on to the Euphrates:
    The hour invites, the galley is prepared,
    And the pavilion, decked for our return,
    In fit adornment for the evening banquet,
    Shall blaze with beauty and with light, until
    It seems unto the stars which are above us
    Itself an opposite star; and we will sit
    Crowned with fresh flowers like----

    _Myr._                             Victims.

    _Sar._                                     No, like sovereigns,
    The Shepherd Kings of patriarchal times,                           560
    Who knew no brighter gems than summer wreaths,[h]
    And none but tearless triumphs. Let us on.

                              _Enter_ PANIA.

    _Pan._ May the King live for ever!

    _Sar._                           Not an hour
    Longer than he can love. How my soul hates
    This language, which makes life itself a lie,
    Flattering dust with eternity.[i] Well, Pania!
    Be brief.

    _Pan._      I am charged by Salemenes to
    Reiterate his prayer unto the King,
    That for this day, at least, he will not quit
    The palace: when the General returns,                              570
    He will adduce such reasons as will warrant
    His daring, and perhaps obtain the pardon
    Of his presumption.

    _Sar._               What! am I then cooped?
    Already captive? can I not even breathe
    The breath of heaven? Tell prince Salemenes,
    Were all Assyria raging round the walls
    In mutinous myriads, I would still go forth.

    _Pan._ I must obey, and yet----

    _Myr._                        Oh, Monarch, listen.--
    How many a day and moon thou hast reclined
    Within these palace walls in silken dalliance,                     580
    And never shown thee to thy people's longing;
    Leaving thy subjects' eyes ungratified,
    The satraps uncontrolled, the Gods unworshipped,
    And all things in the anarchy of sloth,
    Till all, save evil, slumbered through the realm!
    And wilt thou not now tarry for a day,--
    A day which may redeem thee? Wilt thou not
    Yield to the few still faithful a few hours,
    For them, for thee, for thy past fathers' race,
    And for thy sons' inheritance?

    _Pan._                         'Tis true!                          590
    From the deep urgency with which the Prince
    Despatched me to your sacred presence, I
    Must dare to add my feeble voice to that
    Which now has spoken.

    _Sar._               No, it must not be.

    _Myr._ For the sake of thy realm!

    _Sar._                             Away!

    _Pan._                                 For that
    Of all thy faithful subjects, who will rally
    Round thee and thine.

    _Sar._               These are mere fantasies:
    There is no peril:--'tis a sullen scheme
    Of Salemenes, to approve his zeal,
    And show himself more necessary to us.                             600

    _Myr._ By all that's good and glorious take this counsel.

    _Sar._ Business to-morrow.

    _Myr._                    Aye--or death to-night.

    _Sar._ Why let it come then unexpectedly,
    'Midst joy and gentleness, and mirth and love;
    So let me fall like the plucked rose!--far better
    Thus than be withered.

    _Myr._                 Then thou wilt not yield,
    Even for the sake of all that ever stirred
    A monarch into action, to forego
    A trifling revel.

    _Sar._            No.

    _Myr._               Then yield for _mine_;
    For my sake!

    _Sar._      Thine, my Myrrha!

    _Myr._                      'Tis the first                         610
    Boon which I ever asked Assyria's king.

    _Sar._ That's true, and, wer't my kingdom, must be granted.
    Well, for thy sake, I yield me. Pania, hence!
    Thou hear'st me.

    _Pan._           And obey.                              [_Exit_ PANIA.

    _Sar._                    I marvel at thee.
    What is thy motive, Myrrha, thus to urge me?

    _Myr._ Thy safety; and the certainty that nought
    Could urge the Prince thy kinsman to require
    Thus much from thee, but some impending danger.

    _Sar._ And if I do not dread it, why shouldst thou?

    _Myr._ Because _thou_ dost not fear, I fear for _thee_.            620

    _Sar._ To-morrow thou wilt smile at these vain fancies.

    _Myr._ If the worst come, I shall be where none weep,
    And that is better than the power to smile.
    And thou?

    _Sar._    I shall be King, as heretofore.

    _Myr._ Where?

    _Sar._         With Baal, Nimrod, and Semiramis,
    Sole in Assyria, or with them elsewhere.
    Fate made me what I am--may make me nothing--
    But either that or nothing must I be:
    I will not live degraded.

    _Myr._                    Hadst thou felt
    Thus always, none would ever dare degrade thee.                    630

    _Sar._ And who will do so now?

    _Myr._                        Dost thou suspect none?

    _Sar._ Suspect!--that's a spy's office. Oh! we lose
    Ten thousand precious moments in vain words,
    And vainer fears. Within there!--ye slaves, deck
    The Hall of Nimrod for the evening revel;
    If I must make a prison of our palace,
    At least we'll wear our fetters jocundly;
    If the Euphrates be forbid us, and
    The summer-dwelling on its beauteous border,
    Here we are still unmenaced. Ho! within there!                     640
                                                     [_Exit_ SARDANAPALUS.

    _Myr._ (_solus_).
    Why do I love this man? My country's daughters
    Love none but heroes. But I have no country!
    The slave hath lost all save her bonds. I love him;
    And that's the heaviest link of the long chain--
    To love whom we esteem not. Be it so:
    The hour is coming when he'll need all love,
    And find none. To fall from him now were baser
    Than to have stabbed him on his throne when highest
    Would have been noble in my country's creed:
    I was not made for either. Could I save him,                       650
    I should not love _him_ better, but myself;
    And I have need of the last, for I have fallen
    In my own thoughts, by loving this soft stranger:
    And yet, methinks, I love him more, perceiving
    That he is hated of his own barbarians,
    The natural foes of all the blood of Greece.
    Could I but wake a single thought like those
    Which even the Phrygians felt when battling long
    'Twixt Ilion and the sea, within his heart,
    He would tread down the barbarous crowds, and triumph.             660
    He loves me, and I love him; the slave loves
    Her master, and would free him from his vices.
    If not, I have a means of freedom still,
    And if I cannot teach him how to reign,
    May show him how alone a King can leave
    His throne. I must not lose him from my sight.                [_Exit_.





                                 ACT II.


          SCENE I.--_The Portal of the same Hall of the Palace_.

    _Beleses_ (_solus_).
    The Sun goes down: methinks he sets more slowly,
    Taking his last look of Assyria's Empire.
    How red he glares amongst those deepening clouds,
    Like the blood he predicts. If not in vain,
    Thou Sun that sinkest, and ye stars which rise,
    I have outwatched ye, reading ray by ray
    The edicts of your orbs, which make Time tremble[j]
    For what he brings the nations, 'tis the furthest
    Hour of Assyria's years. And yet how calm!
    An earthquake should announce so great a fall--                     10
    A summer's sun discloses it. Yon disk,
    To the star-read Chaldean, bears upon
    Its everlasting page the end of what
    Seemed everlasting; but oh! thou true Sun!
    The burning oracle of all that live,
    As fountain of all life, and symbol of
    Him who bestows it, wherefore dost thou limit
    Thy lore unto calamity? Why not
    Unfold the rise of days more worthy thine
    All-glorious burst from ocean? why not dart                         20
    A beam of hope athwart the future years,
    As of wrath to its days? Hear me! oh, hear me!
    I am thy worshipper, thy priest, thy servant--
    I have gazed on thee at thy rise and fall,
    And bowed my head beneath thy mid-day beams,
    When my eye dared not meet thee. I have watched
    For thee, and after thee, and prayed to thee,
    And sacrificed to thee, and read, and feared thee,
    And asked of thee, and thou hast answered--but
    Only to thus much: while I speak, he sinks--                        30
    Is gone--and leaves his beauty, not his knowledge,
    To the delighted West, which revels in
    Its hues of dying glory. Yet what is
    Death, so it be but glorious? 'Tis a sunset;
    And mortals may be happy to resemble
    The Gods but in decay.

                    _Enter_ ARBACES _by an inner door_.

    _Arb._                Beleses, why
    So wrapt in thy devotions? Dost thou stand
    Gazing to trace thy disappearing God
    Into some realm of undiscovered day?
    Our business is with night--'tis come.

    _Bel._                               But not                        40
    Gone.

    _Arb._    Let it roll on--we are ready.

    _Bel._                                 Yes.
    Would it were over!

    _Arb._              Does the prophet doubt,
    To whom the very stars shine Victory?

    _Bel._ I do not doubt of Victory--but the Victor.

    _Arb._ Well, let thy science settle that. Meantime
    I have prepared as many glittering spears
    As will out-sparkle our allies--your planets.
    There is no more to thwart us. The she-king,
    That less than woman, is even now upon
    The waters with his female mates. The order                         50
    Is issued for the feast in the pavilion.
    The first cup which he drains will be the last
    Quaffed by the line of Nimrod.

    _Bel._                         'Twas a brave one.

    _Arb._ And is a weak one--'tis worn out--we'll mend it.

    _Bel._ Art sure of that?

    _Arb._                    Its founder was a hunter--
    I am a soldier--what is there to fear?

    _Bel._ The soldier.

    _Arb._              And the priest, it may be: but
    If you thought thus, or think, why not retain
    Your king of concubines? why stir me up?
    Why spur me to this enterprise? your own                            60
    No less than mine?

    _Bel._            Look to the sky!

    _Arb._                            I look.

    _Bel._ What seest thou?

    _Arb._                  A fair summer's twilight, and
    The gathering of the stars.

    _Bel._                      And midst them, mark
    Yon earliest, and the brightest, which so quivers,
    As it would quit its place in the blue ether.

    _Arb._ Well?

    _Bel._      'Tis thy natal ruler--thy birth planet.

    _Arb._ (_touching his scabbard_).
    My star is in this scabbard: when it shines,
    It shall out-dazzle comets. Let us think
    Of what is to be done to justify
    Thy planets and their portents. When we conquer,                    70
    They shall have temples--aye, and priests--and thou
    Shalt be the pontiff of--what Gods thou wilt;
    For I observe that they are ever just,
    And own the bravest for the most devout.

    _Bel._ Aye, and the most devout for brave--thou hast not
    Seen me turn back from battle.

    _Arb._                         No; I own thee
    As firm in fight as Babylonia's captain,
    As skilful in Chaldea's worship: now,
    Will it but please thee to forget the priest,
    And be the warrior?

    _Bel._              Why not both?

    _Arb._                           The better;                        80
    And yet it almost shames me, we shall have
    So little to effect. This woman's warfare
    Degrades the very conqueror. To have plucked
    A bold and bloody despot from his throne,
    And grappled with him, clashing steel with steel,
    That were heroic or to win or fall;
    But to upraise my sword against this silkworm,[15]
    And hear him whine, it may be----

    _Bel._                           Do not deem it:
    He has that in him which may make you strife yet;
    And were he all you think, his guards are hardy,                    90
    And headed by the cool, stern Salemenes.

    _Arb._ They'll not resist.

    _Bel._                     Why not? they are soldiers.

    _Arb._                                                True,
    And therefore need a soldier to command them.

    _Bel._ That Salemenes is.

    _Arb._                    But not their King.
    Besides, he hates the effeminate thing that governs,
    For the Queen's sake, his sister. Mark you not
    He keeps aloof from all the revels?

    _Bel._                              But
    Not from the council--there he is ever constant.

    _Arb._ And ever thwarted: what would you have more
    To make a rebel out of? A fool reigning,                           100
    His blood dishonoured, and himself disdained:
    Why, it is _his_ revenge we work for.

    _Bel._                               Could
    He but be brought to think so: this I doubt of.

    _Arb._ What, if we sound him?

    _Bel._                       Yes--if the time served.

                              _Enter_ BALEA.

    _Bal._ Satraps! The king commands your presence at
    The feast to-night.

    _Bel._              To hear is to obey.
    In the pavilion?

    _Bal._           No; here in the palace.

    _Arb._ How! in the palace? it was not thus ordered.

    _Bal._ It is so ordered now.

    _Arb._                        And why?

    _Bal._                                I know not.
    May I retire?

    _Arb._       Stay.

    _Bel._ (_to Arb. aside_). Hush! let him go his way.                110
    (_Alternately to Bal._) Yes, Balea, thank the Monarch, kiss the hem
    Of his imperial robe, and say, his slaves
    Will take the crumbs he deigns to scatter from
    His royal table at the hour--was't midnight?

    _Bal._ It was: the place, the hall of Nimrod. Lords,
    I humble me before you, and depart.                     [_Exit_ BALEA.

    _Arb._ I like not this same sudden change of place;
    There is some mystery: wherefore should he change it?

    _Bel._ Doth he not change a thousand times a day?
    Sloth is of all things the most fanciful--                         120
    And moves more parasangs in its intents
    Than generals in their marches, when they seek
    To leave their foe at fault.--Why dost thou muse?

    _Arb._ He loved that gay pavilion,--it was ever
    His summer dotage.

    _Bel._             And he loved his Queen--
    And thrice a thousand harlotry besides--
    And he has loved all things by turns, except
    Wisdom and Glory.

    _Arb._            Still--I like it not.
    If he has changed--why, so must we: the attack
    Were easy in the isolated bower,                                   130
    Beset with drowsy guards and drunken courtiers;
    But in the hall of Nimrod----

    _Bel._                         Is it so?
    Methought the haughty soldier feared to mount
    A throne too easily--does it disappoint thee
    To find there is a slipperier step or two
    Than what was counted on?

    _Arb._                    When the hour comes,
    Thou shall perceive how far I fear or no.
    Thou hast seen my life at stake--and gaily played for:
    But here is more upon the die--a kingdom.

    _Bel._ I have foretold already--thou wilt win it:                  140
    Then on, and prosper.

    _Arb._                Now were I a soothsayer,
    I would have boded so much to myself.
    But be the stars obeyed--I cannot quarrel
    With them, nor their interpreter. Who's here?

                            _Enter_ SALEMENES.

    _Sal._ Satraps!

    _Bel._            My Prince!

    _Sal._                     Well met--I sought ye both,
    But elsewhere than the palace.

    _Arb._                         Wherefore so?

    _Sal._ 'Tis not the hour.

    _Arb._                    The hour!--what hour?

    _Sal._                                         Of midnight.

    _Bel._ Midnight, my Lord!

    _Sal._                     What, are you not invited?

    _Bel._ Oh! yes--we had forgotten.

    _Sal._                             Is it usual
    Thus to forget a Sovereign's invitation?

    _Arb._ Why--we but now received it.                                150

    _Sal._                              Then why here?

    _Arb._ On duty.

    _Sal._           On what duty?

    _Bel._                         On the state's.
    We have the privilege to approach the presence;
    But found the Monarch absent.[k]

    _Sal._                        And I too
    Am upon duty.

    _Arb._       May we crave its purport?

    _Sal._ To arrest two traitors. Guards! Within there!

                             _Enter Guards_.

    _Sal._ (_continuing_).                              Satraps,
    Your swords.

    _Bel._ (_delivering his_). My lord, behold my scimitar.

    _Arb._ (_drawing his sword_). Take mine.

    _Sal._ (_advancing_).                     I will.

    _Arb._                             But in your heart the blade--
    The hilt quits not this hand.[l]

    _Sal._ (_drawing_).         How! dost thou brave me?
    Tis well--this saves a trial, and false mercy.                     160
    Soldiers, hew down the rebel!

    _Arb._                        Soldiers! Aye--
    _Alone, you_ dare not.

    _Sal._                Alone! foolish slave--
    What is there in thee that a Prince should shrink from
    Of open force? We dread thy treason, not
    Thy strength: thy tooth is nought without its venom--
    The serpent's, not the lion's. Cut him down.

    _Bel._ (_interposing_). Arbaces! Are you mad? Have I not rendered
    _My_ sword? Then trust like me our Sovereign's justice.

    _Arb._   No--I will sooner trust the stars thou prat'st of,
    And this slight arm, and die a king at least                       170
    Of my own breath and body--so far that
    None else shall chain them.

    _Sal._ (_to the Guards_).     You hear _him_ and _me_.
    Take him not,--kill.

                        [_The Guards attack_ ARBACES, _who defends himself
                            valiantly and dexterously till they waver_.

    _Sal._                   Is it even so; and must
    I do the hangman's office? Recreants! see
    How you should fell a traitor.
                                             [SALEMENES _attacks_ ARBACES.

                    _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _and Train_.

    _Sar._                         Hold your hands--
    Upon your lives, I say. What, deaf or drunken?
    My sword! O fool, I wear no sword: here, fellow,
    Give me thy weapon.                                     [_To a Guard_.

                 [SARDANAPALUS _snatches a sword from one of the soldiers,
                     and rushes between the combatants--they separate_.

    _Sar._             In my very palace!
    What hinders me from cleaving you in twain,
    Audacious brawlers?

    _Bel._              Sire, your justice.

    _Sal._                                 Or--                        180
    Your weakness.

    _Sar._ (_raising the sword_). How?

    _Sal._             Strike! so the blow's repeated
    Upon yon traitor--whom you spare a moment,
    I trust, for torture--I'm content.

    _Sar._                             What--him!
    Who dares assail Arbaces?

    _Sal._                    I!

    _Sar._                      Indeed!
    Prince, you forget yourself. Upon what warrant?

    _Sal._ (_showing the signet_). Thine.

    _Arb._ (_confused_).               The King's!

    _Sal._ Yes! and let the King confirm it.

    _Sar._ I parted not from this for such a purpose.

    _Sal._ You parted with it for your safety--I
    Employed it for the best. Pronounce in person.
    Here I am but your slave--a moment past                            190
    I was your representative.

    _Sar._                     Then sheathe
    Your swords.
           [ARBACES _and_ SALEMENES _return their swords to the scabbards_.

    _Sal._ Mine's sheathed: I pray you sheathe _not_ yours:
    Tis the sole sceptre left you now with safety.

    _Sar._ A heavy one; the hilt, too, hurts my hand.
    (_To a Guard_.) Here, fellow, take thy weapon back. Well, sirs,
    What doth this mean?

    _Bel._               The Prince must answer that.

    _Sal._ Truth upon my part, treason upon theirs.

    _Sar._ Treason--Arbaces! treachery and Beleses!
    That were an union I will not believe.

    _Bel._ Where is the proof?

    _Sal._                          I'll answer that, if once          200
    The king demands your fellow-traitor's sword.

    _Arb._ (_to Sal._). A sword which hath been drawn as oft as thine
    Against his foes.

    _Sal._          And now against his brother,
    And in an hour or so against himself.

    _Sar._ That is not possible: he dared not; no--
    No--I'll not hear of such things. These vain bickerings
    Are spawned in courts by base intrigues, and baser
    Hirelings, who live by lies on good men's lives.
    You must have been deceived, my brother.

    _Sal._                                   First
    Let him deliver up his weapon, and                                 210
    Proclaim himself your subject by that duty,
    And I will answer all.

    _Sar._                 Why, if I thought so--
    But no, it cannot be: the Mede Arbaces--
    The trusty, rough, true soldier--the best captain
    Of all who discipline our nations----No,
    I'll not insult him thus, to bid him render
    The scimitar to me he never yielded
    Unto our enemies. Chief, keep your weapon.

    _Sal._ (_delivering back the signet_).
    Monarch, take back your signet.

    _Sar._                          No, retain it;
    But use it with more moderation.

    _Sal._                          Sire,                             200
    I used it for your honour, and restore it
    Because I cannot keep it with my own.
    Bestow it on Arbaces.

    _Sar._                So I should:
    He never asked it.

    _Sal._             Doubt not, he will have it,
    Without that hollow semblance of respect.

    _Bel._ I know not what hath prejudiced the Prince
    So strongly 'gainst two subjects, than whom none
    Have been more zealous for Assyria's weal.

    _Sal._ Peace, factious priest, and faithless soldier! thou
    Unit'st in thy own person the worst vices                          230
    Of the most dangerous orders of mankind.
    Keep thy smooth words and juggling homilies
    For those who know thee not. Thy fellow's sin
    Is, at the least, a bold one, and not tempered
    By the tricks taught thee in Chaldea.

    _Bel._                                Hear him,
    My liege--the son of Belus! he blasphemes
    The worship of the land, which bows the knee
    Before your fathers.

    _Sar._               Oh! for that I pray you
    Let him have absolution. I dispense with
    The worship of dead men; feeling that I                            240
    Am mortal, and believing that the race
    From whence I sprung are--what I see them--ashes.

    _Bel._ King! Do not deem so: they are with the stars,
    And----

    _Sar._  You shall join them ere they will rise,
    If you preach farther--Why, _this_ is rank treason.

    _Sal._ My lord!

    _Sar._          To school me in the worship of
    Assyria's idols! Let him be released--
    Give him his sword.

    _Sal._              My Lord, and King, and Brother,
    I pray ye pause.

    _Sar._           Yes, and be sermonised,
    And dinned, and deafened with dead men and Baal,                   250
    And all Chaldea's starry mysteries.

    _Bel._ Monarch! respect them.

    _Sar._                       Oh! for that--I love them;
    I love to watch them in the deep blue vault,
    And to compare them with my Myrrha's eyes;
    I love to see their rays redoubled in
    The tremulous silver of Euphrates' wave,
    As the light breeze of midnight crisps the broad
    And rolling water, sighing through the sedges
    Which fringe his banks: but whether they may be
    Gods, as some say, or the abodes of Gods,                          260
    As others hold, or simply lamps of night,
    Worlds--or the lights of Worlds--I know nor care not.
    There's something sweet in my uncertainty
    I would not change for your Chaldean lore;
    Besides, I know of these all clay can know
    Of aught above it, or below it--nothing.
    I see their brilliancy and feel their beauty[m]--
    When they shine on my grave I shall know neither.

    _Bel._ For _neither_, Sire, say _better_.

    _Sar._                                   I will wait,
    If it so please you, Pontiff, for that knowledge.                  270
    In the mean time receive your sword, and know
    That I prefer your service militant
    Unto your ministry--not loving either.

    _Sal._ (_aside_). His lusts have made him mad. Then must I save him,
    Spite of himself.

    _Sar._            Please you to hear me, Satraps!
    And chiefly thou, my priest, because I doubt thee
    More than the soldier; and would doubt thee all
    Wert thou not half a warrior: let us part
    In peace--I'll not say pardon--which must be
    Earned by the guilty; this I'll not pronounce ye,                  280
    Although upon this breath of mine depends
    Your own; and, deadlier for ye, on my fears.
    But fear not--for that I am soft, not fearful--
    And so live on. Were I the thing some think me,
    Your heads would now be dripping the last drops
    Of their attainted gore from the high gates
    Of this our palace, into the dry dust,
    Their only portion of the coveted kingdom
    They would be crowned to reign o'er--let that pass.
    As I have said, I will not _deem_ ye guilty,                       290
    Nor _doom_ ye guiltless. Albeit better men
    Than ye or I stand ready to arraign you;
    And should I leave your fate to sterner judges,
    And proofs of all kinds, I might sacrifice
    Two men, who, whatsoe'er they now are, were
    Once honest. Ye are free, sirs.

    _Arb._                          Sire, this clemency----

    _Bel._ (_interrupting him_).
    Is worthy of yourself; and, although innocent,
    We thank----

    _Sar._      Priest! keep your thanksgivings for Belus;
    His offspring needs none.

    _Bel._                    But being innocent----

    _Sar._ Be silent.--Guilt is loud. If ye are loyal,                 300
    Ye are injured men, and should be sad, not grateful.

    _Bel._ So we should be, were justice always done
    By earthly power omnipotent; but Innocence
    Must oft receive her right as a mere favour.

    _Sar._ That's a good sentence for a homily,
    Though not for this occasion. Prithee keep it
    To plead thy Sovereign's cause before his people.

    _Bel._ I trust there is no cause.

    _Sar._                             No _cause_, perhaps;
    But many causers:--if ye meet with such
    In the exercise of your inquisitive function                       310
    On earth, or should you read of it in heaven
    In some mysterious twinkle of the stars,
    Which are your chronicles, I pray you note,
    That there are worse things betwixt earth and heaven
    Than him who ruleth many and slays none;
    And, hating not himself, yet loves his fellows
    Enough to spare even those who would not spare him
    Were they once masters--but that's doubtful. Satraps!
    Your swords and persons are at liberty
    To use them as ye will--but from this hour                         320
    I have no call for either. Salemenes!
    Follow me.

                  [_Exeunt_ SARDANAPALUS, SALEMENES, _and the Train, etc.,
                      leaving_ ARBACES _and_ BELESES.

    _Arb._        Beleses!

    _Bel._                 Now, what think you?

    _Arb._ That we are lost.

    _Bel._                 That we have won the kingdom.

    _Arb._ What? thus suspected--with the sword slung o'er us
    But by a single hair, and that still wavering,
    To be blown down by his imperious breath
    Which spared us--why, I know not.

    _Bel._                            Seek not why;
    But let us profit by the interval.[n]
    The hour is still our own--our power the same--
    The night the same we destined. He hath changed                    330
    Nothing except our ignorance of all
    Suspicion into such a certainty
    As must make madness of delay.

    _Arb._                        And yet--

    _Bel._ What, doubting still?

    _Arb._                      He spared our lives, nay, more,
    Saved them from Salemenes.

    _Bel._                     And how long
    Will he so spare? till the first drunken minute.

    _Arb._ Or sober, rather. Yet he did it nobly;
    Gave royally what we had forfeited
    Basely----

    _Bel._    Say bravely.

    _Arb._                 Somewhat of both, perhaps--
    But it has touched me, and, whate'er betide,                       340
    I will no further on.

    _Bel._                And lose the world!

    _Arb._ Lose any thing except my own esteem.

    _Bel._ I blush that we should owe our lives to such
    A king of distaffs!

    _Arb._              But no less we owe them;
    And I should blush far more to take the grantor's![16]

    _Bel._ Thou may'st endure whate'er thou wilt--the stars
    Have written otherwise.

    _Arb._                  Though they came down,
    And marshalled me the way in all their brightness,
    I would not follow.

    _Bel._             This is weakness--worse
    Than a scared beldam's dreaming of the dead,                       350
    And waking in the dark.--Go to--go to.

    _Arb._ Methought he looked like Nimrod as he spoke,
    Even as the proud imperial statue stands
    Looking the monarch of the kings around it,
    And sways, while they but ornament, the temple.

    _Bel._ I told you that you had too much despised him,
    And that there was some royalty within him--What
    then? he is the nobler foe.

    _Arb._                     But we
    The meaner.--Would he had not spared us!

    _Bel._                                   So--
    Wouldst thou be sacrificed thus readily?                           360

    _Arb._ No--but it had been better to have died
    Than live ungrateful.

    _Bel._                Oh, the souls of some men!
    Thou wouldst digest what some call treason, and
    Fools treachery--and, behold, upon the sudden,
    Because for something or for nothing, this
    Rash reveller steps, ostentatiously,
    'Twixt thee and Salemenes, thou art turned
    Into--what shall I say?--Sardanapalus!
    I know no name more ignominious.

    _Arb._                           But
    An hour ago, who dared to term me such                             370
    Had held his life but lightly--as it is,
    I must forgive you, even as he forgave us--
    Semiramis herself would not have done it.

    _Bel._ No--the Queen liked no sharers of the kingdom,
    Not even a husband.[17]

    _Arb._              I must serve him truly----

    _Bel._ And humbly?

    _Arb._               No, sir, proudly--being honest.
    I shall be nearer thrones than you to heaven;
    And if not quite so haughty, yet more lofty.
    You may do your own deeming--you have codes,
    And mysteries, and corollaries of                                  380
    Right and wrong, which I lack for my direction,
    And must pursue but what a plain heart teaches.
    And now you know me.

    _Bel._               Have you finished?

    _Arb._                                 Yes--
    With you.

    _Bel._    And would, perhaps, betray as well
    As quit me?

    _Arb._       That's a sacerdotal thought,
    And not a soldier's.

    _Bel._               Be it what you will--
    Truce with these wranglings, and but hear me.

    _Arb._                                        No--
    There is more peril in your subtle spirit
    Than in a phalanx.

    _Bel._            If it must be so--
    I'll on alone.

    _Arb._         Alone!

    _Bel._               Thrones hold but one.                         390

    _Arb._ But this is filled.

    _Bel._                      With worse than vacancy--
    A despised monarch. Look to it, Arbaces:
    I have still aided, cherished, loved, and urged you;
    Was willing even to serve you, in the hope
    To serve and save Assyria. Heaven itself
    Seemed to consent, and all events were friendly,
    Even to the last, till that your spirit shrunk
    Into a shallow softness; but now, rather
    Than see my country languish, I will be
    Her saviour or the victim of her tyrant--                          400
    Or one or both--for sometimes both are one;
    And if I win--Arbaces is my servant.

    _Arb._ _Your_ servant!

    _Bel._                Why not? better than be slave,
    The _pardoned_ slave of _she_ Sardanapalus!

                              _Enter_ PANIA.

    _Pan._ My Lords, I bear an order from the king.

    _Arb._ It is obeyed ere spoken.

    _Bel._                          Notwithstanding,
    Let's hear it.

    _Pan._         Forthwith, on this very night,
    Repair to your respective satrapies
    Of Babylon and Media.

    _Bel._                With our troops?

    _Pan._ My order is unto the Satraps and                            410
    Their household train.

    _Arb._                But----

    _Bel._                        It must be obeyed:
    Say, we depart.

    _Pan._          My order is to see you
    Depart, and not to bear your answer.

    _Bel._ (_aside_).                   Aye[o]!
    Well, Sir--we will accompany you hence.

    _Pan._ I will retire to marshal forth the guard
    Of honour which befits your rank, and wait
    Your leisure, so that it the hour exceeds not.
                                                            [_Exit_ PANIA.

    _Bel._ Now then obey!

    _Arb._                Doubtless.

    _Bel._                           Yes, to the gates
    That grate the palace, which is now our prison--
    No further.

    _Arb._   Thou hast harped the truth indeed!                        420
    The realm itself, in all its wide extension,
    Yawns dungeons at each step for thee and me.

    _Bel._ Graves!

    _Arb._         If I thought so, this good sword should dig
    One more than mine.

    _Bel._              It shall have work enough.
    Let me hope better than thou augurest;
    At present, let us hence as best we may.
    Thou dost agree with me in understanding
    This order as a sentence?

    _Arb._                    Why, what other
    Interpretation should it bear? it is
    The very policy of Orient monarchs--                               430
    Pardon and poison--favours and a sword--
    A distant voyage, and an eternal sleep.
    How many Satraps in his father's time--
    For he I own is, or at least _was_, bloodless--

    _Bel._ But _will_ not--_can_ not be so now.

    _Arb._                                     I doubt it.
    How many Satraps have I seen set out
    In his Sire's day for mighty Vice-royalties,
    Whose tombs are on their path! I know not how,
    But they all sickened by the way, it was
    So long and heavy.

    _Bel._             Let us but regain                               440
    The free air of the city, and we'll shorten
    The journey.

    _Arb._      'Twill be shortened at the gates,
    It may be.

    _Bel._    No; they hardly will risk that.
    They mean us to die privately, but not
    Within the palace or the city walls,
    Where we are known, and may have partisans:
    If they had meant to slay us here, we were
    No longer with the living. Let us hence.

    _Arb._ If I but thought he did not mean my life--

    _Bel._ Fool! hence--what else should despotism alarmed             450
    Mean? Let us but rejoin our troops, and march.

    _Arb._ Towards our provinces?

    _Bel._                        No; towards your kingdom.
    There's time--there's heart, and hope, and power, and means--
    Which their half measures leave us in full scope.--
    Away!

    _Arb._ And I even yet repenting must
    Relapse to guilt!

    _Bel._            Self-defence is a virtue,
    Sole bulwark of all right. Away, I say!
    Let's leave this place, the air grows thick and choking,
    And the walls have a scent of night-shade--hence!
    Let us not leave them time for further council.                    460
    Our quick departure proves our civic zeal;
    Our quick departure hinders our good escort,
    The worthy Pania, from anticipating
    The orders of some parasangs from hence:
    Nay, there's no other choice, but----hence, I say[p].
                          [_Exit with_ ARBACES, _who follows reluctantly_.

                  _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _and_ SALEMENES.

    _Sar._ Well, all is remedied, and without bloodshed,
    That worst of mockeries of a remedy;
    We are now secure by these men's exile.

    _Sal._                                  Yes,
    As he who treads on flowers is from the adder
    Twined round their roots.

    _Sar._                    Why, what wouldst have me do?            470

    _Sal._ Undo what you have done.

    _Sar._                           Revoke my pardon?

    _Sal._ Replace the crown now tottering on your temples.

    _Sar._ That were tyrannical.

    _Sal._                       But sure.

    _Sar._                                 We are so.
    What danger can they work upon the frontier?

    _Sal._ They are not there yet--never should they be so,
    Were I well listened to.

    _Sar._                   Nay, I _have_ listened
    Impartially to thee--why not to them?

    _Sal._ You may know that hereafter; as it is,
    I take my leave to order forth the guard.

    _Sar._ And you will join us at the banquet?

    _Sal._                                      Sire,                  480
    Dispense with me--I am no wassailer:
    Command me in all service save the Bacchant's.

    _Sar._ Nay, but 'tis fit to revel now and then.

    _Sal._ And fit that some should watch for those who revel
    Too oft. Am I permitted to depart?

    _Sar._ Yes----Stay a moment, my good Salemenes,
    My brother--my best subject--better Prince
    Than I am King. You should have been the monarch,
    And I--I know not what, and care not; but
    Think not I am insensible to all                                   490
    Thine honest wisdom, and thy rough yet kind,
    Though oft-reproving sufferance of my follies.
    If I have spared these men against thy counsel,
    That is, their lives--it is not that I doubt
    The advice was sound; but, let them live: we will not
    Cavil about their lives--so let them mend them.
    Their banishment will leave me still sound sleep,
    Which their death had not left me.

    _Sal._                             Thus you run
    The risk to sleep for ever, to save traitors--
    A moment's pang now changed for years of crime.                    500
    Still let them be made quiet.

    _Sar._                        Tempt me not;
    My word is past.

    _Sal._           But it may be recalled.

    _Sar._ 'Tis royal.

    _Sal._              And should therefore be decisive.
    This half-indulgence of an exile serves
    But to provoke--a pardon should be full,
    Or it is none.

    _Sar._         And who persuaded me
    After I had repealed them, or at least
    Only dismissed them from our presence, who
    Urged me to send them to their satrapies?

    _Sal._ True; that I had forgotten; that is, Sire,                  510
    If they e'er reached their Satrapies--why, then,
    Reprove me more for my advice.

    _Sar._                        And if
    They do not reach them--look to it!--in safety,
    In safety, mark me--and security--
    Look to thine own.

    _Sal._             Permit me to depart;
    Their _safety_ shall be cared for.

    _Sar._                            Get thee hence, then;
    And, prithee, think more gently of thy brother.

    _Sal._ Sire, I shall ever duly serve my sovereign.
                                                        [_Exit_ SALEMENES.

    _Sar._ (_solus_). That man is of a temper too severe;
    Hard but as lofty as the rock, and free                            520
    From all the taints of common earth--while I
    Am softer clay, impregnated with flowers:
    But as our mould is, must the produce be.
    If I have erred this time, 'tis on the side
    Where Error sits most lightly on that sense,
    I know not what to call it; but it reckons
    With me ofttimes for pain, and sometimes pleasure;
    A spirit which seems placed about my heart
    To count its throbs, not quicken them, and ask
    Questions which mortal never dared to ask me,                      530
    Nor Baal, though an oracular deity--[q]
    Albeit his marble face majestical
    Frowns as the shadows of the evening dim
    His brows to changed expression, till at times
    I think the statue looks in act to speak.
    Away with these vain thoughts, I will be joyous--
    And here comes Joy's true herald.

                             _Enter_ MYRRHA.

    _Myr._                           King! the sky
    Is overcast, and musters muttering thunder,
    In clouds that seem approaching fast, and show
    In forkéd flashes a commanding tempest.[r]                         540
    Will you then quit the palace?

    _Sar._                        Tempest, say'st thou?

    _Myr._ Aye, my good lord.

    _Sar._                    For my own part, I should be
    Not ill content to vary the smooth scene,
    And watch the warring elements; but this
    Would little suit the silken garments and
    Smooth faces of our festive friends. Say, Myrrha,
    Art thou of those who dread the roar of clouds?

    _Myr._ In my own country we respect their voices
    As auguries of Jove.[s]

    _Sar._              Jove!--aye, your Baal--
    Ours also has a property in thunder,                               550
    And ever and anon some falling bolt
    Proves his divinity,--and yet sometimes
    Strikes his own altars.

    _Myr._                  That were a dread omen.

    _Sar._ Yes--for the priests. Well, we will not go forth
    Beyond the palace walls to-night, but make
    Our feast within.

    _Myr._             Now, Jove be praised! that he
    Hath heard the prayer thou wouldst not hear. The Gods
    Are kinder to thee than thou to thyself,
    And flash this storm between thee and thy foes,
    To shield thee from them.

    _Sar._                   Child, if there be peril,                 560
    Methinks it is the same within these walls
    As on the river's brink.

    _Myr._                   Not so; these walls
    Are high and strong, and guarded. Treason has
    To penetrate through many a winding way,
    And massy portal; but in the pavilion
    There is no bulwark.

    _Sar._               No, nor in the palace,
    Nor in the fortress, nor upon the top
    Of cloud-fenced Caucasus, where the eagle sits
    Nested in pathless clefts, if treachery be:
    Even as the arrow finds the airy king,                             570
    The steel will reach the earthly. But be calm;
    The men, or innocent or guilty, are
    Banished, and far upon their way.

    _Myr._                            They live, then?

    _Sar._ So sanguinary? _Thou!_

    _Myr._                      I would not shrink
    From just infliction of due punishment
    On those who seek your life: were't otherwise,
    I should not merit mine. Besides, you heard
    The princely Salemenes.

    _Sar._                  This is strange;
    The gentle and the austere are both against me,
    And urge me to revenge.

    _Myr._                 'Tis a Greek virtue.                        580

    _Sar._ But not a kingly one--I'll none on't; or
    If ever I indulge in't, it shall be
    With kings--my equals.

    _Myr._                 These men sought to be so.

    _Sar._ Myrrha, this is too feminine, and springs
    From fear----

    _Myr._       For you.

    _Sar._               No matter, still 'tis fear.
    I have observed your sex, once roused to wrath,
    Are timidly vindictive to a pitch
    Of perseverance, which I would not copy.
    I thought you were exempt from this, as from
    The childish helplessness of Asian women[t].                       590

    _Myr._ My Lord, I am no boaster of my love,
    Nor of my attributes; I have shared your splendour,
    And will partake your fortunes. You may live
    To find one slave more true than subject myriads:
    But this the Gods avert! I am content
    To be beloved on trust for what I feel,
    Rather than prove it to you in your griefs[u],
    Which might not yield to any cares of mine.

    _Sar._ Grief cannot come where perfect love exists,
    Except to heighten it, and vanish from                             600
    That which it could not scare away. Let's in--
    The hour approaches, and we must prepare
    To meet the invited guests who grace our feast.
                                                                [_Exeunt_.




                                 ACT III.


       SCENE I.--_The Hall of the Palace illuminated_--SARDANAPALUS
         _and his Guests at Table.--A storm without, and Thunder
         occasionally heard during the Banquet_.

    _Sar._ Fill full! why this is as it should be: here
    Is my true realm, amidst bright eyes and faces
    Happy as fair! Here sorrow cannot reach.

    _Zam._ Nor elsewhere--where the King is, pleasure sparkles.

    _Sar._ Is not this better now than Nimrod's huntings,
    Or my wild Grandam's chase in search of kingdoms
    She could not keep when conquered?

    _Alt._                            Mighty though
    They were, as all thy royal line have been,
    Yet none of those who went before have reached
    The acmé of Sardanapalus, who                                       10
    Has placed his joy in peace--the sole true glory.

    _Sar._ And pleasure, good Altada, to which glory
    Is but the path. What is it that we seek?
    Enjoyment! We have cut the way short to it,
    And not gone tracking it through human ashes,
    Making a grave with every footstep.

    _Zam._                             No;
    All hearts are happy, and all voices bless
    The King of peace--who holds a world in jubilee.

    _Sar._ Art sure of that? I have heard otherwise;
    Some say that there be traitors.

    _Zam._                           Traitors they                      20
    Who dare to say so!--'Tis impossible.
    What cause?

    _Sar._      What cause? true,--fill the goblet up;
    We will not think of them: there are none such,
    Or if there be, they are gone.

    _Alt._                         Guests, to my pledge!
    Down on your knees, and drink a measure to
    The safety of the King--the monarch, say I?
    The God Sardanapalus!
                              [ZAMES _and the Guests kneel, and exclaim_--
                          Mightier than
    His father Baal, the God Sardanapalus!
                 [_It thunders as they kneel; some start up in confusion_.

    _Zam._ Why do you rise, my friends? in that strong peal
    His father gods consented.

    _Myr._                     Menaced, rather.                         30
    King, wilt thou bear this mad impiety?

    _Sar._ Impiety!--nay, if the sires who reigned
    Before me can be Gods, I'll not disgrace
    Their lineage. But arise, my pious friends;
    Hoard your devotion for the Thunderer there:
    I seek but to be loved, not worshipped.

    _Alt._                                 Both--
    Both you must ever be by all true subjects.

    _Sar._ Methinks the thunders still increase: it is
    An awful night.

    _Myr._          Oh yes, for those who have
    No palace to protect their worshippers.                             40

    _Sar._ That's true, my Myrrha; and could I convert
    My realm to one wide shelter for the wretched,
    I'd do it.

    _Myr._   Thou'rt no God, then--not to be
    Able to work a will so good and general,
    As thy wish would imply.

    _Sar._                   And your Gods, then,
    Who can, and do not?

    _Myr._               Do not speak of that,
    Lest we provoke them.

    _Sar._                True--, they love not censure
    Better than mortals. Friends, a thought has struck me:
    Were there no temples, would there, think ye, be
    Air worshippers?[v] that is, when it is angry,                      50
    And pelting as even now.

    _Myr._                 The Persian prays
    Upon his mountain.

    _Sar._             Yes, when the Sun shines.

    _Myr._ And I would ask if this your palace were
    Unroofed and desolate, how many flatterers
    Would lick the dust in which the King lay low?

    _Alt._ The fair Ionian is too sarcastic
    Upon a nation whom she knows not well;
    The Assyrians know no pleasure but their King's,
    And homage is their pride.

    _Sar._                     Nay, pardon, guests,
    The fair Greek's readiness of speech.

    _Alt._                               _Pardon!_ sire:                60
    We honour her of all things next to thee.
    Hark! what was that?

    _Zam._               That! nothing but the jar
    Of distant portals shaken by the wind.

    _Alt._ It sounded like the clash of--hark again!

    _Zam._ The big rain pattering on the roof.

    _Sar._                                      No more.
    Myrrha, my love, hast thou thy shell in order?
    Sing me a song of Sappho[18]; her, thou know'st,
    Who in thy country threw----

           _Enter_ PANIA, _with his sword and garments bloody,
              and disordered. The guests rise in confusion_.

    _Pan._ (_to the Guards_).  Look to the portals;
    And with your best speed to the walls without.
    Your arms! To arms! The King's in danger. Monarch                   70
    Excuse this haste,--'tis faith.

    _Sar._                          Speak on.

    _Pan._                                   It is
    As Salemenes feared; the faithless Satraps----

    _Sar._ You are wounded--give some wine. Take breath, good Pania.

    _Pan._ 'Tis nothing--a mere flesh wound. I am worn
    More with my speed to warn my sovereign,
    Than hurt in his defence.

    _Myr._                    Well, Sir, the rebels?

    _Pan._ Soon as Arbaces and Beleses reached
    Their stations in the city, they refused
    To march; and on my attempt to use the power
    Which I was delegated with, they called                             80
    Upon their troops, who rose in fierce defiance.

    _Myr._ All?

    _Pan._     Too many.

    _Sar._              Spare not of thy free speech,
    To spare mine ears--the truth.

    _Pan._                       My own slight guard
    Were faithful, and what's left of it is still so.

    _Myr._ And are these all the force still faithful?

    _Pan._                                            No--
    The Bactrians, now led on by Salemenes,
    Who even then was on his way, still urged
    By strong suspicion of the Median chiefs,
    Are numerous, and make strong head against
    The rebels, fighting inch by inch, and forming                      90
    An orb around the palace, where they mean
    To centre all their force, and save the King.
    (_He hesitates_.) I am charged to----

    _Myr._                            'Tis no time for hesitation.

    _Pan._ Prince Salemenes doth implore the King
    To arm himself, although but for a moment,
    And show himself unto the soldiers: his
    Sole presence in this instant might do more
    Than hosts can do in his behalf.

    _Sar._                           What, ho!
    My armour there.

    _Myr._           And wilt thou?

    _Sar._                         Will I not?
    Ho, there!--but seek not for the buckler: 'tis                     100
    Too heavy:--a light cuirass and my sword.
    Where are the rebels?

    _Pan._                Scarce a furlong's length
    From the outward wall the fiercest conflict rages.

    _Sar._ Then I may charge on horseback. Sfero, ho!
    Order my horse out.--There is space enough
    Even in our courts, and by the outer gate,
    To marshal half the horsemen of Arabia.
                                          [_Exit_ SFERO _for the armour_.

    _Myr._ How I do love thee!

    _Sar._                     I ne'er doubted it.

    _Myr._ But now I know thee.

    _Sar._ (_to his Attendant_). Bring down my spear too--
    Where's Salemenes?

    _Pan._             Where a soldier should be,                      110
    In the thick of the fight.

    _Sar._                     Then hasten to him----Is
    The path still open, and communication
    Left 'twixt the palace and the phalanx?

    _Pan._                                  'Twas
    When I late left him, and I have no fear;
    Our troops were steady, and the phalanx formed.

    _Sar._ Tell him to spare his person for the present,
    And that I will not spare my own--and say,
    I come.

    _Pan._ There's victory in the very word.                [_Exit_ PANIA.

    _Sar._ Altada--Zames--forth, and arm ye! There
    Is all in readiness in the armoury.                                120
    See that the women are bestowed in safety
    In the remote apartments: let a guard
    Be set before them, with strict charge to quit
    The post but with their lives--command it, Zames.
    Altada, arm yourself, and return here;
    Your post is near our person.
                           [_Exeunt_ ZAMES, ALTADA, _and all save_ MYRRHA.

          _Enter_ SFERO _and others with the King's Arms, etc._

    _Sfe._                     King! your armour.

    _Sar._ (_arming himself_). Give me the cuirass--so: my baldric; now
    My sword: I had forgot the helm--where is it?
    That's well--no, 'tis too heavy; you mistake, too--
    It was not this I meant, but that which bears                      130
    A diadem around it.

    _Sfe._              Sire, I deemed
    That too conspicuous from the precious stones
    To risk your sacred brow beneath--and trust me,
    This is of better metal, though less rich.

    _Sar._ You deemed! Are you too turned a rebel? Fellow!
    Your part is to obey: return, and--no--
    It is too late--I will go forth without it.

    _Sfe._ At least, wear this.

    _Sar._                       Wear Caucasus! why, 'tis
    A mountain on my temples.

    _Sfe._                    Sire, the meanest
    Soldier goes not forth thus exposed to battle.                     140
    All men will recognise you--for the storm
    Has ceased, and the moon breaks forth in her brightness.

    _Sar._ I go forth to be recognised, and thus
    Shall be so sooner. Now--my spear! I'm armed.
                              [_In going stops short, and turns to_ SFERO.
    Sfero--I had forgotten--bring the mirror[19].

    _Sfe._ The mirror, Sire?

    _Sar._                   Yes, sir, of polished brass,
    Brought from the spoils of India--but be speedy.
                                                            [_Exit_ SFERO.

    _Sar._ Myrrha, retire unto a place of safety.
    Why went you not forth with the other damsels?

    _Myr._ Because my place is here.

    _Sar._                           And when I am gone----            150

    _Myr._ I follow.

    _Sar._           _You!_ to battle?

    _Myr._                             If it were so,
    'Twere not the first Greek girl had trod the path.
    I will await here your _return_.

    _Sar._                          The place
    Is spacious, and the first to be sought out,
    If they prevail; and, if it be so,
    And I return not----

    _Myr._               Still we meet again.

    _Sar._ How?

    _Myr._      In the spot where all must meet at last--
    In Hades! if there be, as I believe,
    A shore beyond the Styx; and if there be not,
    In ashes.

    _Sar._    Darest thou so much?

    _Myr._                         I dare all things                   160
    Except survive what I have loved, to be
    A rebel's booty: forth, and do your bravest.

                   _Re-enter_ SFERO _with the mirror_.

    _Sar._ (_looking at himself_).
    This cuirass fits me well, the baldric better,
    And the helm not at all. Methinks I seem
                          [_Flings away the helmet after trying it again_.
    Passing well in these toys; and now to prove them.
    Altada! Where's Altada?

    _Sfe._                  Waiting, Sire,
    Without: he has your shield in readiness.

    _Sar._ True--I forgot--he is my shield-bearer
    By right of blood, derived from age to age.
    Myrrha, embrace me;--yet once more--once more--                    170
    Love me, whate'er betide. My chiefest glory
    Shall be to make me worthier of your love.

    _Myr._ Go forth, and conquer!
                                       [_Exeunt_ SARDANAPALUS _and_ SFERO.
                                 Now, I am alone:
    All are gone forth, and of that all how few
    Perhaps return! Let him but vanquish, and
    Me perish! If he vanquish not, I perish;
    For I will not outlive him. He has wound
    About my heart, I know not how nor why.
    Not for that he is King; for now his kingdom
    Rocks underneath his throne, and the earth yawns                   180
    To yield him no more of it than a grave;
    And yet I love him more. Oh, mighty Jove!
    Forgive this monstrous love for a barbarian,
    Who knows not of Olympus! yes, I love him
    Now--now--far more than----Hark--to the war shout!
    Methinks it nears me. If it should be so,
                                          [_She draws forth a small vial_.
    This cunning Colchian poison, which my father
    Learned to compound on Euxine shores, and taught me
    How to preserve, shall free me! It had freed me
    Long ere this hour, but that I loved until                         190
    I half forgot I was a slave:--where all
    Are slaves save One, and proud of servitude,
    So they are served in turn by something lower
    In the degree of bondage: we forget
    That shackles worn like ornaments no less
    Are chains. Again that shout! and now the clash
    Of arms--and now--and now----

                             _Enter_ ALTADA.

    _Alt._                        Ho, Sfero, ho!

    _Myr._ He is not here; what wouldst thou with him? How
    Goes on the conflict?

    _Alt._                Dubiously and fiercely.

    _Myr._ And the King?

    _Alt._              Like a king. I must find Sfero,                200
    And bring him a new spear with his own helmet.[w]
    He fights till now bare-headed, and by far
    Too much exposed. The soldiers knew his face,
    And the foe too; and in the moon's broad light,
    His silk tiara and his flowing hair
    Make him a mark too royal. Every arrow
    Is pointed at the fair hair and fair features,
    And the broad fillet which crowns both.

    _Myr._                                 Ye Gods,
    Who fulminate o'er my father's land, protect him!
    Were you sent by the King?

    _Alt._                     By Salemenes,                           210
    Who sent me privily upon this charge,
    Without the knowledge of the careless sovereign.
    The King! the King fights as he revels! ho!
    What, Sfero! I will seek the armoury--
    He must be there.                                      [_Exit_ ALTADA.

    _Myr._           'Tis no dishonour--no--
    'Tis no dishonour to have loved this man.
    I almost wish now, what I never wished
    Before--that he were Grecian. If Alcides
    Were shamed in wearing Lydian Omphale's
    She-garb, and wielding her vile distaff; surely                    220
    He, who springs up a Hercules at once,
    Nursed in effeminate arts from youth to manhood,
    And rushes from the banquet to the battle,
    As though it were a bed of love, deserves
    That a Greek girl should be his paramour,
    And a Greek bard his minstrel--a Greek tomb
    His monument. How goes the strife, sir?

                           _Enter an Officer_.

    _Officer_.                            Lost,
    Lost almost past recovery. Zames! Where
    Is Zames?

    _Myr._     Posted with the guard appointed
    To watch before the apartment of the women.                        230
                                                          [_Exit Officer_.

    _Myr._ (_sola_). He's gone; and told no more than that all's lost!
    What need have I to know more? In those words,
    Those little words, a kingdom and a king,
    A line of thirteen ages, and the lives
    Of thousands, and the fortune of all left
    With life, are merged; and I, too, with the great,
    Like a small bubble breaking with the wave
    Which bore it, shall be nothing. At the least,
    My fate is in my keeping: no proud victor
    Shall count me with his spoils.

                              _Enter_ PANIA.

    _Pan._                         Away with me,                       240
    Myrrha, without delay; we must not lose
    A moment--all that's left us now.

    _Myr._                            The King?

    _Pan._ Sent me here to conduct you hence, beyond
    The river, by a secret passage.

    _Myr._                          Then
    He lives----

    _Pan._         And charged me to secure your life,
    And beg you to live on for his sake, till
    He can rejoin you.

    _Myr._             Will he then give way?

    _Pan._ Not till the last. Still, still he does whate'er
    Despair can do; and step by step disputes
    The very palace.

    _Myr._          They are here, then:--aye,                         250
    Their shouts come ringing through the ancient halls,
    Never profaned by rebel echoes till
    This fatal night. Farewell, Assyria's line!
    Farewell to all of Nimrod! Even the name
    Is now no more.

    _Pan._          Away with me--away!

    _Myr._ No: I'll die here!--Away, and tell your King
    I loved him to the last.

          _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _and_ SALEMENES _with Soldiers_.
          PANIA _quits_ MYRRHA, _and ranges himself with them_.

    _Sar._                  Since it is thus,
    We'll die where we were born--in our own halls[x]
    Serry your ranks--stand firm. I have despatched
    A trusty satrap for the guard of Zames,
    All fresh and faithful; they'll be here anon.
    All is not over,--Pania, look to Myrrha.
                                          [PANIA _returns towards_ MYRRHA.

    _Sal._ We have breathing time; yet once more charge, my friends--
    One for Assyria!

    _Sar._           Rather say for Bactria!
    My faithful Bactrians, I will henceforth be
    King of your nation, and we'll hold together
    This realm as province.

    _Sal._                  Hark! they come--they come.

             _Enter_ BELESES _and_ ARBACES _with the Rebels_.

    _Arb._ Set on, we have them in the toil. Charge!
    charge!

    _Bel._ On! on!--Heaven fights for us, and with us--On!

               [_They charge the King and_ SALEMENES _with their troops,
                     who defend themselves till the arrival of_
                     ZAMES _with the Guard before mentioned.
                     The Rebels are then driven off, and pursued by_
                     SALEMENES, _etc. As the King is going to join the
                     pursuit,_ BELESES _crosses him_.

    _Bel._ Ho! tyrant--_I_ will end this war.

    _Sar._                                   Even so,                  270
    My warlike priest, and precious prophet, and
    Grateful and trusty subject: yield, I pray thee.
    I would reserve thee for a fitter doom,
    Rather than dip my hands in holy blood.

    _Bel._ Thine hour is come.

    _Sar._                    No, thine.--I've lately read,
    Though but a young astrologer, the stars;
    And ranging round the zodiac, found thy fate
    In the sign of the Scorpion, which proclaims
    That thou wilt now be crushed.

    _Bel._                        But not by thee.
                         [_They fight;_ BELESES _is wounded and disarmed_.

    _Sar._ (_raising his sword to despatch him, exclaims_)--
    Now call upon thy planets, will they shoot                         280
    From the sky to preserve their seer and credit?

                            [_A party of Rebels enter and rescue_ BELESES.
                              _They assail the King, who in turn, is
                             rescued by a Party of his Soldiers, who drive
                             the Rebels off_.

    The villain was a prophet after all.
    Upon them--ho! there--victory is ours.
                                                       [_Exit in pursuit_.

    _Myr._ (_to Pan._)
    Pursue! Why stand'st thou here, and leavest the ranks
    Of fellow-soldiers conquering without thee?

    _Pan._ The King's command was not to quit thee.

    _Myr._                                         _Me!_
    Think not of me--a single soldier's arm
    Must not be wanting now. I ask no guard,
    I need no guard: what, with a world at stake,
    Keep watch upon a woman? Hence, I say,                             290
    Or thou art shamed! Nay, then, _I_ will go forth,
    A feeble female, 'midst their desperate strife,
    And bid thee guard me _there_--where thou shouldst shield
    Thy sovereign.                                         [_Exit_ MYRRHA.

    _Pan._         Yet stay, damsel!--She's gone.
    If aught of ill betide her, better I
    Had lost my life. Sardanapalus holds her
    Far dearer than his kingdom, yet he fights
    For that too; and can I do less than he,
    Who never flashed a scimitar till now?
    Myrrha, return, and I obey you, though                             300
    In disobedience to the monarch.                         [_Exit_ PANIA.

            _Enter_ ALTADA _and_ SFERO _by an opposite door_.

    _Alt._                       Myrrha!
    What, gone? yet she was here when the fight raged,
    And Pania also. Can aught have befallen them?

    _Sfe._ I saw both safe, when late the rebels fled;
    They probably are but retired to make
    Their way back to the harem.

    _Alt._                      If the King
    Prove victor, as it seems even now he must,
    And miss his own Ionian, we are doomed
    To worse than captive rebels.

    _Sfe._                       Let us trace them:
    She cannot be fled far; and, found, she makes                      310
    A richer prize to our soft sovereign
    Than his recovered kingdom.

    _Alt._                      Baal himself
    Ne'er fought more fiercely to win empire, than
    His silken son to save it: he defies
    All augury of foes or friends; and like
    The close and sultry summer's day, which bodes
    A twilight tempest, bursts forth in such thunder
    As sweeps the air and deluges the earth.
    The man's inscrutable.

    _Sfe._                 Not more than others.
    All are the sons of circumstance: away--                           320
    Let's seek the slave out, or prepare to be
    Tortured for his infatuation, and[y]
    Condemned without a crime.                                  [_Exeunt_.

                  _Enter_ SALEMENES _and Soldiers, etc._

    _Sal._                    The triumph is
    Flattering: they are beaten backward from the palace,
    And we have opened regular access
    To the troops stationed on the other side
    Euphrates, who may still be true; nay, must be,
    When they hear of our victory. But where
    Is the chief victor? where's the King?

             _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS, _cum suis, etc., and_ MYRRHA.

    _Sar._                                  Here, brother.

    _Sal._ Unhurt, I hope.

    _Sar._                 Not quite; but let it pass.                 330
    We've cleared the palace----

    _Sal._                        And I trust the city.
    Our numbers gather; and I've ordered onward
    A cloud of Parthians, hitherto reserved,
    All fresh and fiery, to be poured upon them
    In their retreat, which soon will be a flight.

    _Sar._ It is already, or at least they marched
    Faster than I could follow with my Bactrians,
    Who spared no speed. I am spent: give me a seat.

    _Sal._ There stands the throne, Sire.

    _Sar._                                Tis no place to rest on,
    For mind nor body: let me have a couch,                            340
                                                     [_They place a seat_.
    A peasant's stool, I care not what: so--now
    I breathe more freely.

    _Sal._                 This great hour has proved
    The brightest and most glorious of your life.

    _Sar._ And the most tiresome. Where's my cupbearer?
    Bring me some water.

    _Sal._ (_smiling_) 'Tis the first time he
    Ever had such an order: even I,[z]
    Your most austere of counsellors, would now
    Suggest a purpler beverage.

    _Sar._                    Blood--doubtless.
    But there's enough of that shed; as for wine,
    I have learned to-night the price of the pure element:             350
    Thrice have I drank of it, and thrice renewed,
    With greater strength than the grape ever gave me,
    My charge upon the rebels. Where's the soldier
    Who gave me water in his helmet?[20]

    _One of the Guards_.              Slain, Sire!
    An arrow pierced his brain, while, scattering[aa]
    The last drops from his helm, he stood in act
    To place it on his brows.

    _Sar._                   Slain! unrewarded!
    And slain to serve my thirst: that's hard, poor slave!
    Had he but lived, I would have gorged him with
    Gold: all the gold of earth could ne'er repay                      360
    The pleasure of that draught; for I was parched
    As I am now.                           [_They bring water--he drinks_.
                 I live again--from henceforth
    The goblet I reserve for hours of love,
    But war on water.

    _Sal._            And that bandage, Sire,
    Which girds your arm?

    _Sar._                A scratch from brave Beleses.

    _Myr._ Oh! he is wounded![ab]

    _Sar._                        Not too much of that;
    And yet it feels a little stiff and painful,
    Now I am cooler.

    _Myr._           You have bound it with----

    _Sar._ The fillet of my diadem: the first time
    That ornament was ever aught to me,                                370
    Save an incumbrance.

    _Myr._ (_to the Attendants_). Summon speedily
    A leech of the most skilful: pray, retire:
    I will unbind your wound and tend it.

    _Sar._                                Do so,
    For now it throbs sufficiently: but what
    Know'st thou of wounds? yet wherefore do I ask?
    Know'st thou, my brother, where I lighted on
    This minion?

    _Sal._       Herding with the other females,
    Like frightened antelopes.

    _Sar._                     No: like the dam
    Of the young lion, femininely raging
    (And femininely meaneth furiously,                                 380
    Because all passions in excess are female,)
    Against the hunter flying with her cub,
    She urged on with her voice and gesture, and
    Her floating hair and flashing eyes,[21] the soldiers,
    In the pursuit.

    _Sal._         Indeed!

    _Sar._                You see, this night
    Made warriors of more than me. I paused
    To look upon her, and her kindled cheek;
    Her large black eyes, that flashed through her long hair
    As it streamed o'er her; her blue veins that rose
    Along her most transparent brow; her nostril                       390
    Dilated from its symmetry; her lips
    Apart; her voice that clove through all the din,
    As a lute pierceth through the cymbal's clash,
    Jarred but not drowned by the loud brattling; her
    Waved arms, more dazzling with their own born whiteness
    Than the steel her hand held, which she caught up
    From a dead soldier's grasp;--all these things made
    Her seem unto the troops a prophetess
    Of victory, or Victory herself,
    Come down to hail us hers.[22]

    _Sal._ (_aside_).           This is too much.                      400
    Again the love-fit's on him, and all's lost,
    Unless we turn his thoughts. (_Aloud_.) But pray thee, Sire,
    Think of your wound--you said even now 'twas painful.

    _Sar._ That's true, too; but I must not think of it.

    _Sal._ I have looked to all things needful, and will now
    Receive reports of progress made in such
    Orders as I had given, and then return
    To hear your further pleasure.

    _Sar._                         Be it so.

    _Sal._ (_in retiring_). Myrrha!

    _Myr._                         Prince!

    _Sal._         You have shown a soul to-night,
    Which, were he not my sister's lord----But now                     410
    I have no time: thou lovest the King?

    _Myr._                               I love
    Sardanapalus.

    _Sal._         But wouldst have him King still?

    _Myr._ I would not have him less than what he should be.

    _Sal._ Well then, to have him King, and yours, and all
    He should, or should not be; to have him _live_,
    Let him not sink back into luxury.
    You have more power upon his spirit than
    Wisdom within these walls, or fierce rebellion
    Raging without: look well that he relapse not.

    _Myr._ There needed not the voice of Salemenes                     420
    To urge me on to this: I will not fail.
    All that a woman's weakness can----

    _Sal._                               Is power
    Omnipotent o'er such a heart as his:
    Exert it wisely.                                    [_Exit_ SALEMENES.

    _Sar._           Myrrha! what, at whispers
    With my stern brother? I shall soon be jealous.

    _Myr._ (_smiling_).
    You have cause, Sire; for on the earth there breathes not
    A man more worthy of a woman's love,
    A soldier's trust, a subject's reverence,
    A king's esteem--the whole world's admiration!

    _Sar._ Praise him, but not so warmly. I must not                   430
    Hear those sweet lips grow eloquent in aught
    That throws me into shade; yet you speak truth.

    _Myr._ And now retire, to have your wound looked to,
    Pray lean on me.

    _Sar._          Yes, love! but not from pain.
                                                          [_Exeunt omnes_.




                                 ACT IV.

            SCENE I.--SARDANAPALUS _discovered sleeping upon a
            Couch, and occasionally disturbed in his slumbers,
                         with_ MYRRHA _watching_.

    _Myr._ (_sola, gazing_).
    I have stolen upon his rest, if rest it be,
    Which thus convulses slumber: shall I wake him?
    No, he seems calmer. Oh, thou God of Quiet!
    Whose reign is o'er sealed eyelids and soft dreams,
    Or deep, deep sleep, so as to be unfathomed,
    Look like thy brother, Death,[23]--so still, so stirless--
    For then we are happiest, as it may be, we
    Are happiest of all within the realm
    Of thy stern, silent, and unwakening Twin.
    Again he moves--again the play of pain                              10
    Shoots o'er his features, as the sudden gust
    Crisps the reluctant lake that lay so calm[ac]
    Beneath the mountain shadow; or the blast
    Ruffles the autumn leaves, that drooping cling
    Faintly and motionless to their loved boughs.
    I must awake him--yet not yet; who knows
    From what I rouse him? It seems pain; but if
    I quicken him to heavier pain? The fever
    Of this tumultuous night, the grief too of
    His wound, though slight, may cause all this, and shake            20
    Me more to see than him to suffer. No:
    Let Nature use her own maternal means,
    And I await to second, not disturb her.

    _Sar._ (_awakening_).
    Not so--although he multiplied the stars,
    And gave them to me as a realm to share
    From you and with you! I would not so purchase
    The empire of Eternity. Hence--hence--
    Old Hunter of the earliest brutes! and ye,[ad]
    Who hunted fellow-creatures as if brutes!
    Once bloody mortals--and now bloodier idols,                        30
    If your priests lie not! And thou, ghastly Beldame!
    Dripping with dusky gore, and trampling on
    The carcasses of Inde--away! away!
    Where am I? Where the spectres? Where--No--that
    Is no false phantom: I should know it 'midst
    All that the dead dare gloomily raise up
    From their black gulf to daunt the living. Myrrha!

    _Myr._ Alas! thou art pale, and on thy brow the drops
    Gather like night dew. My beloved, hush--
    Calm thee. Thy speech seems of another world,                       40
    And thou art lord of this. Be of good cheer;
    All will go well.

    _Sar._            Thy _hand_--so--'tis thy hand;
    'Tis flesh; grasp--clasp--yet closer, till I feel
    Myself that which I was.

    _Myr._                   At least know me
    For what I am, and ever must be--thine.

    _Sar._ I know it now. I know this life again.
    Ah, Myrrha! I have been where we shall be.

    _Myr._ My lord!

    _Sar._          I've been i' the grave--where worms are lords
    And kings are----But I did not deem it so;
    I thought 'twas nothing.

    _Myr._                   So it is; except                           50
    Unto the timid, who anticipate
    That which may never be.

    _Sar._                   Oh, Myrrha! if
    Sleep shows such things, what may not Death disclose?

    _Myr._ I know no evil Death can show, which Life
    Has not already shown to those who live
    Embodied longest. If there be indeed
    A shore where Mind survives, 'twill be as Mind
    All unincorporate: or if there flits
    A shadow of this cumbrous clog of clay.
    Which stalks, methinks, between our souls and heaven,               60
    And fetters us to earth--at least the phantom,
    Whate'er it have to fear, will not fear Death.

    _Sar._ I fear it not; but I have felt--have seen--
    A legion of the dead.

    _Myr._                And so have I.
    The dust we tread upon was once alive,
    And wretched. But proceed: what hast thou seen?
    Speak it, 'twill lighten thy dimmed mind.

    _Sar._                                    Methought----

    _Myr._ Yet pause, thou art tired--in pain--exhausted; all
    Which can impair both strength and spirit: seek
    Rather to sleep again.

    _Sar._                 Not now--I would not                         70
    Dream; though I know it now to be a dream
    What I have dreamt:--and canst thou bear to hear it?

    _Myr._ I can bear all things, dreams of life or death,
    Which I participate with you in semblance
    Or full reality.

    _Sar._           And this looked real,
    I tell you: after that these eyes were open,
    I saw them in their flight--for then they fled.

    _Myr._ Say on.

    _Sar._           I saw, that is, I dreamed myself
    Here--here--even where we are, guests as we were,
    Myself a host that deemed himself but guest,                        80
    Willing to equal all in social freedom;
    But, on my right hand and my left, instead
    Of thee and Zames, and our customed meeting,
    Was ranged on my left hand a haughty, dark,
    And deadly face; I could not recognise it,
    Yet I had seen it, though I knew not where:
    The features were a Giant's, and the eye
    Was still, yet lighted; his long locks curled down
    On his vast bust, whence a huge quiver rose
    With shaft-heads feathered from the eagle's wing,                   90
    That peeped up bristling through his serpent hair.[ae]
    I invited him to fill the cup which stood
    Between us, but he answered not; I filled it;
    He took it not, but stared upon me, till
    I trembled at the fixed glare of his eye:
    I frowned upon him as a king should frown;
    He frowned not in his turn, but looked upon me
    With the same aspect, which appalled me more,
    Because it changed not; and I turned for refuge
    To milder guests, and sought them on the right,                    100
    Where thou wert wont to be. But----                      [_He pauses_.

    _Myr._                           What instead?

    _Sar._ In thy own chair--thy own place in the banquet--
    I sought thy sweet face in the circle--but
    Instead--a grey-haired, withered, bloody-eyed,
    And bloody-handed, ghastly, ghostly thing,
    Female in garb, and crowned upon the brow,
    Furrowed with years, yet sneering with the passion
    Of vengeance, leering too with that of lust,
    Sate:--my veins curdled.[24]

    _Myr._                Is this all?

    _Sar._                              Upon
    Her right hand--her lank, bird-like, right hand--stood             110
    A goblet, bubbling o'er with blood; and on
    Her left, another, filled with--what I saw not,
    But turned from it and her. But all along
    The table sate a range of crownéd wretches,
    Of various aspects, but of one expression.

    _Myr._ And felt you not this a mere vision?

    _Sar._                                        No:
    It was so palpable, I could have touched them.
    I turned from one face to another, in
    The hope to find at last one which I knew
    Ere I saw theirs: but no--all turned upon me,                      120
    And stared, but neither ate nor drank, but stared,
    Till I grew stone, as they seemed half to be,
    Yet breathing stone, for I felt life in them,
    And life in me: there was a horrid kind
    Of sympathy between us, as if they
    Had lost a part of death to come to me,
    And I the half of life to sit by them.
    We were in an existence all apart
    From heaven or earth----And rather let me see
    Death all than such a being!

    _Myr._                       And the end?                          130

    _Sar._ At last I sate, marble, as they, when rose
    The Hunter and the Crone; and smiling on me--
    Yes, the enlarged but noble aspect of
    The Hunter smiled upon me--I should say,
    His lips, for his eyes moved not--and the woman's
    Thin lips relaxed to something like a smile.
    Both rose, and the crowned figures on each hand
    Rose also, as if aping their chief shades--
    Mere mimics even in death--but I sate still:
    A desperate courage crept through every limb,                      140
    And at the last I feared them not, but laughed
    Full in their phantom faces. But then--then
    The Hunter laid his hand on mine: I took it,
    And grasped it--but it melted from my own;
    While he too vanished, and left nothing but
    The memory of a hero, for he looked so.

    _Myr._ And was: the ancestor of heroes, too,
    And thine no less.

    _Sar._             Aye, Myrrha, but the woman,
    The female who remained, she flew upon me,
    And burnt my lips up with her noisome kisses;                      150
    And, flinging down the goblets on each hand,
    Methought their poisons flowed around us, till
    Each formed a hideous river. Still she clung;
    The other phantoms, like a row of statues,
    Stood dull as in our temples, but she still
    Embraced me, while I shrunk from her, as if,
    In lieu of her remote descendant, I
    Had been the son who slew her for her incest.[25]
    Then--then--a chaos of all loathsome things
    Thronged thick and shapeless: I was dead, yet feeling--            160
    Buried, and raised again--consumed by worms,
    Purged by the flames, and withered in the air!
    I can fix nothing further of my thoughts,
    Save that I longed for thee, and sought for thee,
    In all these agonies,--and woke and found thee.

    _Myr._ So shalt thou find me ever at thy side,
    Here and hereafter, if the last may be.
    But think not of these things--the mere creations
    Of late events, acting upon a frame
    Unused by toil, yet over-wrought by toil--                         170
    Such as might try the sternest.

    _Sar._                          I am better.
    Now that I see thee once more, _what was seen_
    Seems nothing.

                            _Enter_ SALEMENES.

    _Sal._             Is the king so soon awake?

    _Sar._ Yes, brother, and I would I had not slept;
    For all the predecessors of our line
    Rose up, methought, to drag me down to them.
    My father was amongst them, too; but he,
    I know not why, kept from me, leaving me
    Between the hunter-founder of our race,
    And her, the homicide and husband-killer,                          180
    Whom you call glorious.

    _Sal._                  So I term you also,
    Now you have shown a spirit like to hers.
    By day-break I propose that we set forth,
    And charge once more the rebel crew, who still
    Keep gathering head, repulsed, but not quite quelled.

    _Sar._ How wears the night?

    _Sal._                     There yet remain some hours
    Of darkness: use them for your further rest.

    _Sar._ No, not to-night, if 'tis not gone: methought
    I passed hours in that vision.

    _Myr._                         Scarcely one;
    I watched by you: it was a heavy hour,                             190
    But an hour only.

    _Sar._             Let us then hold council;
    To-morrow we set forth.

    _Sal._                 But ere that time,
    I had a grace to seek.

    _Sar._                'Tis granted.

    _Sal._                             Hear it
    Ere you reply too readily; and 'tis
    For _your_ ear only.

    _Myr._              Prince, I take my leave.
                                                             [Exit MYRRHA.

    _Sal._ That slave deserves her freedom.

    _Sar._                                 Freedom only!
    That slave deserves to share a throne.

    _Sal._                                 Your patience--
    'Tis not yet vacant, and 'tis of its partner
    I come to speak with you.

    _Sar._                   How! of the Queen?

    _Sal._ Even so. I judged it fitting for their safety,              200
    That, ere the dawn, she sets forth with her children
    For Paphlagonia, where our kinsman Cotta[26]
    Governs; and there, at all events, secure
    My nephews and your sons their lives, and with them
    Their just pretensions to the crown in case----

    _Sar._ I perish--as is probable: well thought--
    Let them set forth with a sure escort.

    _Sal._                                That
    Is all provided, and the galley ready
    To drop down the Euphrates; but ere they
    Depart, will you not see----

    _Sar._                       My sons? It may                       210
    Unman my heart, and the poor boys will weep;
    And what can I reply to comfort them,
    Save with some hollow hopes, and ill-worn smiles?
    You know I cannot feign.

    _Sal._                  But you can feel!
    At least, I trust so: in a word, the Queen
    Requests to see you ere you part--for ever.

    _Sar._ Unto what end? what purpose? I will grant
    Aught--all that she can ask--but such a meeting.

    _Sal._ You know, or ought to know, enough of women,
    Since you have studied them so steadily[af],                       220
    That what they ask in aught that touches on
    The heart, is dearer to their feelings or
    Their fancy, than the whole external world.
    I think as you do of my sister's wish;
    But 'twas her wish--she is my sister--you
    Her husband--will you grant it?

    _Sar._                         'Twill be useless:
    But let her come.

    _Sal._            I go.                             [_Exit_ SALEMENES.

    _Sar._                 We have lived asunder
    Too long to meet again--and _now_ to meet!
    Have I not cares enow, and pangs enow,
    To bear alone, that we must mingle sorrows,                        230
    Who have ceased to mingle love?

                    _Re-enter_ SALEMENES _and_ ZARINA.

    _Sal._                          My sister! Courage:
    Shame not our blood with trembling, but remember
    From whence we sprung. The Queen is present, Sire.

    _Zar._ I pray thee, brother, leave me.

    _Sal._                                Since you ask it.
                                                        [_Exit_ SALEMENES.

    _Zar._ Alone with him! How many a year has passed[27],
    Though we are still so young, since we have met,
    Which I have worn in widowhood of heart.
    He loved me not: yet he seems little changed--
    Changed to me only--would the change were mutual!
    He speaks not--scarce regards me--not a word,                      240
    Nor look--yet he _was_ soft of voice and aspect,
    Indifferent, not austere. My Lord!

    _Sar._                            Zarina!

    _Zar._ No, _not_ Zarina--do not say Zarina.
    That tone--That word--annihilate long years,
    And things which make them longer.

    _Sar._                             'Tis too late
    To think of these past dreams. Let's not reproach--
    That is, reproach me not--for the _last_ time----

    _Zar._ And _first_, I ne'er reproached you.

    _Sar._                                     'Tis most true;
    And that reproof comes heavier on my heart
    Than----But our hearts are not in our own power.                  250

    _Zar._ Nor hands; but I gave both.

    _Sar._                            Your brother said
    It was your will to see me, ere you went
    From Nineveh with----(_He hesitates_.)

    _Zar._               Our children: it is true.
    I wish to thank you that you have not divided
    My heart from all that's left it now to love--
    Those who are yours and mine, who look like you,
    And look upon me as you looked upon me
    Once----but _they_ have not changed.

    _Sar._                                Nor ever will.
    I fain would have them dutiful.

    _Zar._                         I cherish
    Those infants, not alone from the blind love                       260
    Of a fond mother, but as a fond woman.
    They are now the only tie between us.

    _Sar._                               Deem not
    I have not done you justice: rather make them
    Resemble your own line than their own Sire.
    I trust them with you--to you: fit them for
    A throne, or, if that be denied----You have heard
    Of this night's tumults?

    _Zar._                  I had half forgotten,
    And could have welcomed any grief save yours,
    Which gave me to behold your face again.

    _Sar._ The throne--I say it not in fear--but 'tis                  270
    In peril: they perhaps may never mount it:
    But let them not for this lose sight of it.
    I will dare all things to bequeath it them;
    But if I fail, then they must win it back
    Bravely--and, won, wear it wisely, not as I[ag]
    Have wasted down my royalty.

    _Zar._                      They ne'er
    Shall know from me of aught but what may honour
    Their father's memory.

    _Sar._                 Rather let them hear
    The truth from you than from a trampling world.
    If they be in adversity, they'll learn                             280
    Too soon the scorn of crowds for crownless Princes,
    And find that all their father's sins are theirs.
    My boys!--I could have borne it were I childless.

    _Zar._ Oh! do not say so--do not poison all
    My peace left, by unwishing that thou wert
    A father. If thou conquerest, they shall reign,
    And honour him who saved the realm for them,
    So little cared for as his own; and if----

    _Sar._ 'Tis lost, all Earth will cry out, "thank your father!"
    And they will swell the echo with a curse.                         290

    _Zar._ That they shall never do; but rather honour
    The name of him, who, dying like a king,
    In his last hours did more for his own memory
    Than many monarchs in a length of days,
    Which date the flight of time, but make no annals.

    _Sar._ Our annals draw perchance unto their close;
    But at the least, whate'er the past, their end
    Shall be like their beginning--memorable.

    _Zar._ Yet, be not rash--be careful of your life,
    Live but for those who love.

    _Sar._                       And who are they?                     300
    A slave, who loves from passion--I'll not say
    Ambition--she has seen thrones shake, and loves;
    A few friends who have revelled till we are
    As one, for they are nothing if I fall;
    A brother I have injured--children whom
    I have neglected, and a spouse----

    _Zar._                             Who loves.

    _Sar._ And pardons?

    _Zar._               I have never thought of this,
    And cannot pardon till I have condemned.

    _Sar._ My wife!

    _Zar._          Now blessings on thee for that word!
    I never thought to hear it more--from thee.                        310

    _Sar._ Oh! thou wilt hear it from my subjects. Yes--
    These slaves whom I have nurtured, pampered, fed,
    And swoln with peace, and gorged with plenty, till
    They reign themselves--all monarchs in their mansions--
    Now swarm forth in rebellion, and demand
    His death, who made their lives a jubilee;
    While the few upon whom I have no claim
    Are faithful! This is true, yet monstrous.

    _Zar._                                    'Tis
    Perhaps too natural; for benefits
    Turn poison in bad minds.

    _Sar._                    And good ones make                       320
    Good out of evil. Happier than the bee,
    Which hives not but from wholesome flowers.

    _Zar._                                     Then reap
    The honey, nor inquire whence 'tis derived.
    Be satisfied--you are not all abandoned.

    _Sar._ My life insures me that. How long, bethink you,
    Were not I yet a king, should I be mortal;
    That is, where mortals _are_, not where they must be?

    _Zar._ I know not. But yet live for my--that is,
    Your children's sake!

    _Sar._                My gentle, wronged Zarina!
    I am the very slave of Circumstance                                330
    And Impulse--borne away with every breath!
    Misplaced upon the throne--misplaced in life.
    I know not what I could have been, but feel
    I am not what I should be--let it end.
    But take this with thee: if I was not formed
    To prize a love like thine, a mind like thine,
    Nor dote even on thy beauty--as I've doted
    On lesser charms, for no cause save that such
    Devotion was a duty, and I hated
    All that looked like a chain for me or others                      340
    (This even Rebellion must avouch); yet hear
    These words, perhaps among my last--that none
    E'er valued more thy virtues, though he knew not
    To profit by them--as the miner lights
    Upon a vein of virgin ore, discovering
    That which avails him nothing: he hath found it,
    But 'tis not his--but some superior's, who
    Placed him to dig, but not divide the wealth
    Which sparkles at his feet; nor dare he lift
    Nor poise it, but must grovel on, upturning                        350
    The sullen earth.

    _Zar._            Oh! if thou hast at length
    Discovered that my love is worth esteem,
    I ask no more--but let us hence together,
    And _I_--let me say _we_--shall yet be happy.
    Assyria is not all the earth--we'll find
    A world out of our own--and be more blessed
    Than I have ever been, or thou, with all
    An empire to indulge thee.

                            _Enter_ SALEMENES.

    _Sal._                    I must part ye--
    The moments, which must not be lost, are passing.

    _Zar._ Inhuman brother! wilt thou thus weigh out                   360
    Instants so high and blest?

    _Sal._                      Blest!

    _Zar._                            He hath been
    So gentle with me, that I cannot think
    Of quitting.

    _Sal._      So--this feminine farewell
    Ends as such partings end, in _no_ departure.
    I thought as much, and yielded against all
    My better bodings. But it must not be.

    _Zar._ Not be?

    _Sal._         Remain, and perish----

    _Zar._                               With my husband----

    _Sal._ And children.

    _Zar._                Alas!

    _Sal._                       Hear me, sister, like
    _My_ sister:--all's prepared to make your safety
    Certain, and of the boys too, our last hopes;                      370
    'Tis not a single question of mere feeling,
    Though that were much--but 'tis a point of state:
    The rebels would do more to seize upon
    The offspring of their sovereign, and so crush----

    _Zar._ Ah! do not name it.

    _Sal._                      Well, then, mark me: when
    They are safe beyond the Median's grasp, the rebels
    Have missed their chief aim--the extinction of
    The line of Nimrod. Though the present King
    Fall, his sons live--for victory and vengeance.

    _Zar._ But could not I remain, alone?

    _Sal._                                What! leave                  380
    Your children, with two parents and yet orphans--
    In a strange land--so young, so distant?

    _Zar._                                   No--
    My heart will break.

    _Sal._               Now you know all--decide.

    _Sar._ Zarina, he hath spoken well, and we
    Must yield awhile to this necessity.
    Remaining here, you may lose all; departing,
    You save the better part of what is left,
    To both of us, and to such loyal hearts
    As yet beat in these kingdoms.

    _Sal._                         The time presses.

    _Sar._ Go, then. If e'er we meet again, perhaps                    390
    I may be worthier of you--and, if not,
    Remember that my faults, though not atoned for,
    Are _ended_. Yet, I dread thy nature will
    Grieve more above the blighted name and ashes
    Which once were mightiest in Assyria--than----
    But I grow womanish again, and must not;
    I must learn sternness now. My sins have all
    Been of the softer order----_hide_ thy tears--
    I do not bid thee _not_ to shed them--'twere
    Easier to stop Euphrates at its source                             400
    Than one tear of a true and tender heart--
    But let me not behold them; they unman me
    Here when I had remanned myself. My brother,
    Lead her away.

    _Zar._         Oh, God! I never shall
    Behold him more!

    _Sal._ (_striving to conduct her_).
                    Nay, sister, I _must_ be obeyed.

    _Zar._ I must remain--away! you shall not hold me.
    What, shall he die alone?--_I_ live alone?

    _Sal._ He shall _not die alone_; but lonely you
    Have lived for years.

    _Zar._                That's false! I knew _he_ lived,
    And lived upon his image--let me go!                               410

    _Sal._ (_conducting her off the stage_).
    Nay, then, I must use some fraternal force,
    Which you will pardon.

    _Zar._                 Never. Help me! Oh!
    Sardanapalus, wilt thou thus behold me
    Torn from thee?

    _Sal._          Nay--then all is lost again,
    If that this moment is not gained.

    _Zar._                             My brain turns--
    My eyes fail--where is he?                              [_She faints_.

    _Sar._ (_advancing_).     No--set her down;
    She's dead--and you have slain her.

    _Sal._                             'Tis the mere
    Faintness of o'erwrought passion: in the air
    She will recover. Pray, keep back.--[_Aside_.] I must
    Avail myself of this sole moment to                                420
    Bear her to where her children are embarked,
    I' the royal galley on the river.
                                               [SALEMENES _bears her off_.

    _Sar._ (_solus_).                This, too--
    And this too must I suffer--I, who never
    Inflicted purposely on human hearts
    A voluntary pang! But that is false--
    She loved me, and I loved her.--Fatal passion!
    Why dost thou not expire at _once_ in hearts
    Which thou hast lighted up at once? Zarina![ah]
    I must pay dearly for the desolation
    Now brought upon thee. Had I never loved                           430
    But thee, I should have been an unopposed
    Monarch of honouring nations. To what gulfs
    A single deviation from the track
    Of human duties leads even those who claim
    The homage of mankind as their born due,
    And find it, till they forfeit it themselves!

                             _Enter_ MYRRHA.

    _Sar._ _You_ here! Who called you?

    _Myr._                            No one--but I heard
    Far off a voice of wail and lamentation,
    And thought----

    _Sar._           It forms no portion of your duties
    To enter here till sought for.

    _Myr._                        Though I might,                      440
    Perhaps, recall some softer words of yours
    (Although they _too were chiding_), which reproved me,
    Because I ever dreaded to intrude;
    Resisting my own wish and your injunction
    To heed no time nor presence, but approach you
    Uncalled for:--I retire.

    _Sar._                   Yet stay--being here.
    I pray you pardon me: events have soured me
    Till I wax peevish--heed it not: I shall
    Soon be myself again.

    _Myr._                I wait with patience,
    What I shall see with pleasure.

    _Sar._                          Scarce a moment                    450
    Before your entrance in this hall, Zarina,
    Queen of Assyria, departed hence.

    _Myr._ Ah!

    _Sar._     Wherefore do you start?

    _Myr._                             Did I do so?

    _Sar._ 'Twas well you entered by another portal,
    Else you had met. That pang at least is spared her!

    _Myr._ I know to feel for her.

    _Sar._                        That is too much,
    And beyond nature--'tis nor mutual[ai]
    Nor possible. You cannot pity her,
    Nor she aught but----

    _Myr._               Despise the favourite slave?
    Not more than I have ever scorned myself.                          460

    _Sar._ Scorned! what, to be the envy of your sex,
    And lord it o'er the heart of the World's lord?

    _Myr._ Were you the lord of twice ten thousand worlds--
    As you are like to lose the one you swayed--
    I did abase myself as much in being
    Your paramour, as though you were a peasant--
    Nay, more, if that the peasant were a Greek.

    _Sar._ You talk it well----

    _Myr._                     And truly.

    _Sar._                               In the hour
    Of man's adversity all things grow daring
    Against the falling; but as I am not                               470
    Quite fall'n, nor now disposed to bear reproaches,
    Perhaps because I merit them too often,
    Let us then part while peace is still between us.

    _Myr._ Part!

    _Sar._       Have not all past human beings parted,
    And must not all the present one day part?

    _Myr._ Why?

    _Sar._     For your safety, which I will have looked to,
    With a strong escort to your native land;
    And such gifts, as, if you had not been all
    A Queen, shall make your dowry worth a kingdom.

    _Myr._ I pray you talk not thus.

    _Sar._                          The Queen is gone:                 480
    You need not shame to follow. I would fall
    Alone--I seek no partners but in pleasure.

    _Myr._ And I no pleasure but in parting not.
    You shall not force me from you.

    _Sar._                           Think well of it--
    It soon may be too late.

    _Myr._                   So let it be;
    For then you cannot separate me from you.

    _Sar._ And will not; but I thought you wished it.

    _Myr._                                             I!

    _Sar._ You spoke of your abasement.

    _Myr._                              And I feel it
    Deeply--more deeply than all things but love.

    _Sar._ Then fly from it.

    _Myr._                  'Twill not recall the past--               490
    'Twill not restore my honour, nor my heart.
    No--here I stand or fall. If that you conquer,
    I live to joy in your great triumph: should
    Your lot be different, I'll not weep, but share it.
    You did not doubt me a few hours ago.

    _Sar._ Your courage never--nor your love till now;
    And none could make me doubt it save yourself.
    Those words----

    _Myr._            Were words. I pray you, let the proofs
    Be in the past acts you were pleased to praise
    This very night, and in my further bearing,                        500
    Beside, wherever you are borne by fate.

    _Sar._ I am content: and, trusting in my cause,
    Think we may yet be victors and return
    To peace--the only victory I covet.
    To me war is no glory--conquest no
    Renown. To be forced thus to uphold my right
    Sits heavier on my heart than all the wrongs[aj]
    These men would bow me down with. Never, never
    Can I forget this night, even should I live
    To add it to the memory of others.                                 510
    I thought to have made mine inoffensive rule
    An era of sweet peace 'midst bloody annals,
    A green spot amidst desert centuries,
    On which the Future would turn back and smile,
    And cultivate, or sigh when it could not
    Recall Sardanapalus' golden reign.
    I thought to have made my realm a paradise,
    And every moon an epoch of new pleasures.
    I took the rabble's shouts for love--the breath
    Of friends for truth--the lips of woman for                        520
    My only guerdon--so they are, my Myrrha:             [_He kisses her_.
    Kiss me. Now let them take my realm and life!
    They shall have both, but never _thee!_

    _Myr._                                 No, never!
    Man may despoil his brother man of all
    That's great or glittering--kingdoms fall, hosts yield,
    Friends fail--slaves fly--and all betray--and, more
    Than all, the most indebted--but a heart
    That loves without self-love! 'Tis here--now prove it.

                            _Enter_ SALEMENES.

    _Sal._ I sought you--How! _she_ here again?

    _Sar._                                     Return not
    _Now_ to reproof: methinks your aspect speaks                      530
    Of higher matter than a woman's presence.

    _Sal._ The only woman whom it much imports me
    At such a moment now is safe in absence--
    The Queen's embarked.

    _Sar._                And well? say that much.

    _Sal._                                         Yes.
    Her transient weakness has passed o'er; at least,
    It settled into tearless silence: her
    Pale face and glittering eye, after a glance
    Upon her sleeping children, were still fixed
    Upon the palace towers as the swift galley
    Stole down the hurrying stream beneath the starlight;              540
    But she said nothing.

    _Sar._                Would I felt no more
    Than she has said!

    _Sal._             'Tis now too late to feel.
    Your feelings cannot cancel a sole pang:
    To change them, my advices bring sure tidings
    That the rebellious Medes and Chaldees, marshalled
    By their two leaders, are already up
    In arms again; and, serrying their ranks,
    Prepare to attack: they have apparently
    Been joined by other Satraps.

    _Sar._                        What! more rebels?
    Let us be first, then.

    _Sal._                 That were hardly prudent                    550
    Now, though it was our first intention. If
    By noon to-morrow we are joined by those
    I've sent for by sure messengers, we shall be
    In strength enough to venture an attack,
    Aye, and pursuit too; but, till then, my voice
    Is to await the onset.

    _Sar._                 I detest
    That waiting; though it seems so safe to fight
    Behind high walls, and hurl down foes into
    Deep fosses, or behold them sprawl on spikes
    Strewed to receive them, still I like it not--                     560
    My soul seems lukewarm; but when I set on them,
    Though they were piled on mountains, I would have
    A pluck at them, or perish in hot blood!--
    Let me then charge.

    _Sal._ You talk like a young soldier.

    _Sar._ I am no soldier, but a man: speak not
    Of soldiership, I loathe the word, and those
    Who pride themselves upon it; but direct me
    Where I may pour upon them.

    _Sal._                     You must spare
    To expose your life too hastily; 'tis not
    Like mine or any other subject's breath:                           570
    The whole war turns upon it--with it; this
    Alone creates it, kindles, and may quench it--
    Prolong it--end it.

    _Sar._            Then let us end both!
    'Twere better thus, perhaps, than prolong either;
    I'm sick of one, perchance of both.
                                              [_A trumpet sounds without_.

    _Sal._                             Hark!

    _Sar._                                  Let us
    Reply, not listen.

    _Sal._            And your wound!

    _Sar._                           'Tis bound--
    'Tis healed--I had forgotten it. Away!
    A leech's lancet would have scratched me deeper;[ak]
    The slave that gave it might be well ashamed
    To have struck so weakly.

    _Sal._                   Now, may none this hour                   580
    Strike with a better aim!

    _Sar._                   Aye, if we conquer;
    But if not, they will only leave to me
    A task they might have spared their king. Upon them!
                                                  [_Trumpet sounds again_.

    _Sal._ I am with you.

    _Sar._               Ho, my arms! again, my arms!
                                                                [_Exeunt_.




                                  ACT V.

                 SCENE I.-_The same Hall in the Palace_.

                           MYRRHA _and_ BALEA.

    _Myr._ (_at a window_)[28]
    The day at last has broken. What a night
    Hath ushered it! How beautiful in heaven!
    Though varied with a transitory storm,
    More beautiful in that variety!
    How hideous upon earth! where Peace and Hope,
    And Love and Revel, in an hour were trampled
    By human passions to a human chaos,
    Not yet resolved to separate elements--
    'Tis warring still! And can the sun so rise,
    So bright, so rolling back the clouds into                          10
    Vapours more lovely than the unclouded sky,
    With golden pinnacles, and snowy mountains,
    And billows purpler than the Ocean's, making
    In heaven a glorious mockery of the earth,
    So like we almost deem it permanent;
    So fleeting, we can scarcely call it aught
    Beyond a vision, 'tis so transiently
    Scattered along the eternal vault: and yet
    It dwells upon the soul, and soothes the soul,
    And blends itself into the soul, until                              20
    Sunrise and sunset form the haunted epoch
    Of Sorrow and of Love; which they who mark not,
    Know not the realms where those twin genii[al]
    (Who chasten and who purify our hearts,
    So that we would not change their sweet rebukes
    For all the boisterous joys that ever shook
    The air with clamour) build the palaces
    Where their fond votaries repose and breathe
    Briefly;--but in that brief cool calm inhale
    Enough of heaven to enable them to bear                             30
    The rest of common, heavy, human hours,
    And dream them through in placid sufferance,
    Though seemingly employed like all the rest
    Of toiling breathers in allotted tasks[am]
    Of pain or pleasure, _two_ names for _one_ feeling,
    Which our internal, restless agony
    Would vary in the sound, although the sense
    Escapes our highest efforts to be happy.

    _Bal._ You muse right calmly: and can you so watch
    The sunrise which may be our last?

    _Myr._                             It is                            40
    Therefore that I so watch it, and reproach
    Those eyes, which never may behold it more,
    For having looked upon it oft, too oft,
    Without the reverence and the rapture due
    To that which keeps all earth from being as fragile
    As I am in this form. Come, look upon it,
    The Chaldee's God, which, when I gaze upon,
    I grow almost a convert to your Baal.

    _Bal._ As now he reigns in heaven, so once on earth
    He swayed.

    _Myr._    He sways it now far more, then; never                     50
    Had earthly monarch half the power and glory
    Which centres in a single ray of his.

    _Bal._ Surely he is a God!

    _Myr._                      So we Greeks deem too;
    And yet I sometimes think that gorgeous orb
    Must rather be the abode of Gods than one
    Of the immortal sovereigns. Now he breaks
    Through all the clouds, and fills my eyes with light
    That shuts the world out. I can look no more.

    _Bal._ Hark! heard you not a sound?

    _Myr._                            No, 'twas mere fancy;
    They battle it beyond the wall, and not                             60
    As in late midnight conflict in the very
    Chambers: the palace has become a fortress
    Since that insidious hour; and here, within
    The very centre, girded by vast courts
    And regal halls of pyramid proportions,
    Which must be carried one by one before
    They penetrate to where they then arrived,
    We are as much shut in even from the sound
    Of peril as from glory.

    _Bal._                  But they reached
    Thus far before.

    _Myr._           Yes, by surprise, and were                         70
    Beat back by valour: now at once we have
    Courage and vigilance to guard us.

    _Bal._                              May they
    Prosper!

    _Myr._    That is the prayer of many, and
    The dread of more: it is an anxious hour;
    I strive to keep it from my thoughts. Alas!
    How vainly!

    _Bal._      It is said the King's demeanour
    In the late action scarcely more appalled
    The rebels than astonished his true subjects.

    _Myr._ 'Tis easy to astonish or appal
    The vulgar mass which moulds a horde of slaves;                     80
    But he did bravely.

    _Bal._              Slew he not Beleses?
    I heard the soldiers say he struck him down.

    _Myr._ The wretch was overthrown, but rescued to
    Triumph, perhaps, o'er one who vanquished him
    In fight, as he had spared him in his peril;
    And by that heedless pity risked a crown.

    _Bal._                                    Hark!

    _Myr._ You are right; some steps approach, but slowly.

         _Enter Soldiers, bearing in_ SALEMENES _wounded, with a
          broken javelin in his side: they seat him upon one of
                the couches which furnish the Apartment_.

    _Myr._ Oh, Jove!

    _Bal._            Then all is over.

    _Sal._                              That is false.
    Hew down the slave who says so, if a soldier.

    _Myr._ Spare him--he's none: a mere court butterfly,                90
    That flutter in the pageant of a monarch.

    _Sal._ Let him live on, then.

    _Myr._                       So wilt thou, I trust.

    _Sal._ I fain would live this hour out, and the event,
    But doubt it. Wherefore did ye bear me here?

    _Sol._ By the King's order. When the javelin struck you,
    You fell and fainted: 'twas his strict command
    To bear you to this hall.

    _Sal._                    'Twas not ill done:
    For seeming slain in that cold dizzy trance,
    The sight might shake our soldiers--but--'tis vain,
    I feel it ebbing!

    _Myr._            Let me see the wound;                            100
    I am not quite skilless: in my native land
    'Tis part of our instruction. War being constant,
    We are nerved to look on such things.[an]

    _Sol._                               Best extract
    The javelin.

    _Myr._       Hold! no, no, it cannot be.

    _Sal._ I am sped, then!

    _Myr._                   With the blood that fast must follow
    The extracted weapon, I do fear thy life.

    _Sal._ And I _not_ death. Where was the King when you
    Conveyed me from the spot where I was stricken?

    _Sol._ Upon the same ground, and encouraging
    With voice and gesture the dispirited troops                       110
    Who had seen you fall, and faltered back.

    _Sal._                                    Whom heard ye
    Named next to the command?

    _Sol._                     I did not hear.

    _Sal._ Fly, then, and tell him, 'twas my last request
    That Zames take my post until the junction,
    So hoped for, yet delayed, of Ofratanes,
    Satrap of Susa. Leave me here: our troops
    Are not so numerous as to spare your absence.

    _Sol._ But Prince----

    _Sal._               Hence, I say! Here's a courtier and
    A woman, the best chamber company.
    As you would not permit me to expire                               120
    Upon the field, I'll have no idle soldiers
    About my sick couch. Hence! and do my bidding!
                                                   [_Exeunt the Soldiers_.

    _Myr._ Gallant and glorious Spirit! must the earth
    So soon resign thee?

    _Sal._               Gentle Myrrha, 'tis
    The end I would have chosen, had I saved
    The monarch or the monarchy by this;
    As 'tis, I have not outlived them.

    _Myr._                             You wax paler.

    _Sal._ Your hand; this broken weapon but prolongs
    My pangs, without sustaining life enough
    To make me useful: I would draw it forth                           130
    And my life with it, could I but hear how
    The fight goes.

                   _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _and Soldiers_.

    _Sar._         My best brother!

    _Sal._                         And the battle
    Is lost?

    _Sar._ (_despondingly_). You see _me here_.

    _Sal._                                    I'd rather see you _thus!_
                      [_He draws out the weapon from the wound, and dies_.

    _Sar._ And _thus_ I will be seen; unless the succour,
    The last frail reed of our beleagured hopes,
    Arrive with Ofratanes.

    _Myr._                 Did you not
    Receive a token from your dying brother,
    Appointing Zames chief?

    _Sar._                  I did.

    _Myr._                        Where's Zames?

    _Sar._ Dead.

    _Myr._       And Altada?

    _Sar._                   Dying.

    _Myr._                          Pania? Sfero?

    _Sar._ Pania yet lives; but Sfero's fled or captive.               140
    I am alone.

    _Myr._      And is all lost?

    _Sar._                      Our walls,
    Though thinly manned, may still hold out against
    Their present force, or aught save treachery:
    But i' the field----

    _Myr._                I thought 'twas the intent
    Of Salemenes not to risk a sally
    Till ye were strengthened by the expected succours.

    _Sar._ _I_ over-ruled him.

    _Myr._                   Well, the _fault's_ a brave one.

    _Sar._ But fatal. Oh, my brother! I would give
    These realms, of which thou wert the ornament,
    The sword and shield, the sole-redeeming honour,                   150
    To call back----But I will not weep for thee;
    Thou shall be mourned for as thou wouldst be mourned.
    It grieves me most that thou couldst quit this life
    Believing that I could survive what thou
    Hast died for--our long royalty of race.
    If I redeem it, I will give thee blood
    Of thousands, tears of millions, for atonement,
    (The tears of all the good are thine already).
    If not, we meet again soon,--if the spirit
    Within us lives beyond:--thou readest mine,                        160
    And dost me justice now. Let me once clasp
    That yet warm hand, and fold that throbless heart
                                                     [_Embraces the body_.
    To this which beats so bitterly. Now, bear
    The body hence.

    _Sol._          Where?

    _Sar._              To my proper chamber.
    Place it beneath my canopy, as though
    The King lay there: when this is done, we will
    Speak further of the rites due to such ashes.
                            [_Exeunt Soldiers with the body of_ SALEMENES.

                              _Enter_ PANIA.

    _Sar._ Well, Pania! have you placed the guards, and issued
    The orders fixed on?

    _Pan._              Sire, I have obeyed.

    _Sar._ And do the soldiers keep their hearts up?

    _Pan._                                            Sire?            170

    _Sar._ I am answered! When a king asks twice, and has
    A question as an answer to _his_ question,
    It is a portent. What! they are disheartened?

    _Pan._ The death of Salemenes, and the shouts
    Of the exulting rebels on his fall,
    Have made them----

    _Sar._           _Rage_--not droop--it should have been.
    We'll find the means to rouse them.

    _Pan._                              Such a loss
    Might sadden even a victory.

    _Sar._                       Alas!
    Who can so feel it as I feel? but yet,
    Though cooped within these walls, they are strong, and we          180
    Have those without will break their way through hosts,
    To make their sovereign's dwelling what it was--
    A palace, not a prison--nor a fortress.

                       _Enter an Officer, hastily_.

    _Sar._ Thy face seems ominous. Speak!

    _Offi._                               I dare not.

    _Sar._                                           Dare not?
    While millions dare revolt with sword in hand!
    That's strange. I pray thee break that loyal silence
    Which loathes to shock its sovereign; we can hear
    Worse than thou hast to tell.

    _Pan._                        Proceed--thou hearest.

    _Offi._ The wall which skirted near the river's brink
    Is thrown down by the sudden inundation                            190
    Of the Euphrates, which now rolling, swoln
    From the enormous mountains where it rises,
    By the late rains of that tempestuous region,
    O'erfloods its banks, and hath destroyed the bulwark.

    _Pan._ That's a black augury! it has been said
    For ages, "That the City ne'er should yield
    To man, until the River grew its foe."

    _Sar._ I can forgive the omen, not the ravage.
    How much is swept down of the wall?

    _Offi._                             About
    Some twenty stadia.[29]

    _Sar._              And all this is left                          200
    Pervious to the assailants?

    _Offi._                     For the present
    The River's fury must impede the assault;
    But when he shrinks into his wonted channel,
    And may be crossed by the accustomed barks,
    The palace is their own.

    _Sar._                   That shall be never.
    Though men, and gods, and elements, and omens,
    Have risen up 'gainst one who ne'er provoked them,
    My father's house shall never be a cave
    For wolves to horde and howl in.

    _Pan._                           With your sanction,
    I will proceed to the spot, and take such measures                 210
    For the assurance of the vacant space
    As time and means permit.

    _Sar._                    About it straight,
    And bring me back, as speedily as full
    And fair investigation may permit,
    Report of the true state of this irruption
    Of waters.                          [_Exeunt_ PANIA _and the Officer_.

    _Myr._    Thus the very waves rise up
    Against you.

    _Sar._      They are not my subjects, girl,
    And may be pardoned, since they can't be punished.

    _Myr._ I joy to see this portent shakes you not.

    _Sar._ I am past the fear of portents: they can tell me            220
    Nothing I have not told myself since midnight:
    Despair anticipates such things.

    _Myr._                           Despair!

    _Sar._ No; not despair precisely. When we know
    All that can come, and how to meet it, our
    Resolves, if firm, may merit a more noble
    Word than this is to give it utterance.
    But what are words to us? we have well nigh done
    With them and all things.

    _Myr._                    Save _one deed_--the last
    And greatest to all mortals; crowning act
    Of all that was, or is, or is to be--                              230
    The only thing common to all mankind,
    So different in their births, tongues, sexes, natures,
    Hues, features, climes, times, feelings, intellects,[ao]
    Without one point of union save in this--
    To which we tend, for which we're born, and thread
    The labyrinth of mystery, called life.

    _Sar._ Our clue being well nigh wound out, let's be cheerful.
    They who have nothing more to fear may well
    Indulge a smile at that which once appalled;
    As children at discovered bugbears.

                            _Re-enter_ PANIA.

    _Pan._                              'Tis                           240
    As was reported: I have ordered there
    A double guard, withdrawing from the wall,
    Where it was strongest, the required addition
    To watch the breach occasioned by the waters.

    _Sar._ You have done your duty faithfully, and as
    My worthy Pania! further ties between us
    Draw near a close--I pray you take this key:
                                                           [_Gives a key_.
    It opens to a secret chamber, placed
    Behind the couch in my own chamber--(Now
    Pressed by a nobler weight than e'er it bore--                     250
    Though a long line of sovereigns have lain down
    Along its golden frame--as bearing for
    A time what late was Salemenes.)--Search
    The secret covert to which this will lead you;
    'Tis full of treasure;[30] take it for yourself
    And your companions:[ap] there's enough to load ye,
    Though ye be many. Let the slaves be freed, too;
    And all the inmates of the palace, of
    Whatever sex, now quit it in an hour.
    Thence launch the regal barks, once formed for pleasure,           260
    And now to serve for safety, and embark.
    The river's broad and swoln, and uncommanded,
    (More potent than a king) by these besiegers.
    Fly! and be happy!

    _Pan._             Under your protection!
    So you accompany your faithful guard.

    _Sar._ No, Pania! that must not be; get thee hence,
    And leave me to my fate.

    _Pan._                   'Tis the first time
    I ever disobeyed: but now----

    _Sar._                      So all men
    Dare beard me now, and Insolence within
    Apes Treason from without. Question no further;                    270
    'Tis my command, my last command. Wilt _thou_
    Oppose it? _thou!_

    _Pan._              But yet--not yet.

    _Sar._                               Well, then,
    Swear that you will obey when I shall give
    The signal.

    _Pan._     With a heavy but true heart,
    I promise.

    _Sar._      'Tis enough. Now order here
    Faggots, pine-nuts, and withered leaves, and such
    Things as catch fire and blaze with one sole spark;
    Bring cedar, too, and precious drugs, and spices,
    And mighty planks, to nourish a tall pile;
    Bring frankincense and myrrh, too, for it is                       280
    For a great sacrifice I build the pyre!
    And heap them round yon throne.

    _Pan._                         My Lord!

    _Sar._                                 I have said it,
    And _you_ have sworn.

    _Pan._               And could keep my faith
    Without a vow.                                          [_Exit_ PANIA.

    _Myr._        What mean you?

    _Sar._                      You shall know
    Anon--what the whole earth shall ne'er forget.

                    PANIA, _returning with a Herald_.

    _Pan._ My King, in going forth upon my duty,
    This herald has been brought before me, craving
    An audience.

    _Sar._      Let him speak.

    _Her._                    The _King_ Arbaces----

    _Sar._ What, crowned already?--But, proceed.

    _Her._                                       Beleses,
    The anointed High-priest----

    _Sar._                      Of what god or demon?                  290
    With new kings rise new altars. But, proceed;
    You are sent to prate your master's will, and not
    Reply to mine.

    _Her._        And Satrap Ofratanes----

    _Sar._ Why, _he_ is _ours_.

    _Her._ (_showing a ring_). Be sure that he is now
    In the camp of the conquerors; behold
    His signet ring.

    _Sar._          'Tis his. A worthy triad!
    Poor Salemenes! thou hast died in time
    To see one treachery the less: this man
    Was thy true friend and my most trusted subject.
    Proceed.

    _Her._   They offer thee thy life, and freedom                     300
    Of choice to single out a residence
    In any of the further provinces,
    Guarded and watched, but not confined in person,
    Where thou shalt pass thy days in peace; but on
    Condition that the three young princes are
    Given up as hostages.

    _Sar._ (_ironically_). The generous Victors!

    _Her._ I wait the answer.

    _Sar._                    Answer, slave! How long
    Have slaves decided on the doom of kings?

    _Her._ Since they were free.

    _Sar._                       Mouthpiece of mutiny!
    Thou at the least shalt learn the penalty                          310
    Of treason, though its proxy only. Pania!
    Let his head be thrown from our walls within
    The rebels' lines, his carcass down the river.
    Away with him!                    [PANIA _and the Guards seizing him_.

    _Pan._        I never yet obeyed
    Your orders with more pleasure than the present.
    Hence with him, soldiers! do not soil this hall
    Of royalty with treasonable gore;
    Put him to rest without.

    _Her._                  A single word:
    My office, King, is sacred.

    _Sar._                     And what's _mine_?
    That thou shouldst come and dare to ask of me                      320
    To lay it down?

    _Her._         I but obeyed my orders,
    At the same peril if refused, as now
    Incurred by my obedience.

    _Sar._                   So there are
    New monarchs of an hour's growth as despotic
    As sovereigns swathed in purple, and enthroned
    From birth to manhood!

    _Her._                My life waits your breath.
    Yours (I speak humbly)--but it may be--yours
    May also be in danger scarce less imminent:
    Would it then suit the last hours of a line
    Such as is that of Nimrod, to destroy                              330
    A peaceful herald, unarmed, in his office;
    And violate not only all that man
    Holds sacred between man and man--but that
    More holy tie which links us with the Gods?

    _Sar._ He's right.--Let him go free.--My life's last act
    Shall not be one of wrath. Here, fellow, take
                              [_Gives him a golden cup from a table near_.
    This golden goblet, let it hold your wine,
    And think of _me_; or melt it into ingots,
    And think of nothing but their weight and value.

    _Her._ I thank you doubly for my life, and this                    340
    Most gorgeous gift, which renders it more precious.
    But must I bear no answer?

    _Sar._                    Yes,--I ask
    An hour's truce to consider.

    _Her._                      But an hour's?

    _Sar._ An hour's: if at the expiration of
    That time your masters hear no further from me,
    They are to deem that I reject their terms,
    And act befittingly.

    _Her._              I shall not fail
    To be a faithful legate of your pleasure.

    _Sar._ And hark! a word more.

    _Her._                        I shall not forget it,
    Whate'er it be.

    _Sar._         Commend me to Beleses;                              350
    And tell him, ere a year expire, I summon
    Him hence to meet me.

    _Her._               Where?

    _Sar._                     At Babylon.
    At least from thence he will depart to meet me.

    _Her._ I shall obey you to the letter.                 [_Exit Herald_.

    _Sar._                                Pania!--
    Now, my good Pania!--quick--with what I ordered.

    _Pan._ My Lord,--the soldiers are already charged.
    And see! they enter.

       _Soldiers enter, and form a Pile about the Throne, etc._[31]

    _Sar._             Higher, my good soldiers,
    And thicker yet; and see that the foundation
    Be such as will not speedily exhaust
    Its own too subtle flame; nor yet be quenched                      360
    With aught officious aid would bring to quell it.
    Let the throne form the _core_ of it; I would not
    Leave that, save fraught with fire unquenchable,
    To the new comers. Frame the whole as if
    'Twere to enkindle the strong tower of our
    Inveterate enemies. Now it bears an aspect!
    How say you, Pania, will this pile suffice
    For a King's obsequies?

    _Pan._                 Aye, for a kingdom's.
    I understand you, now.

    _Sar._                And blame me?

    _Pan._                             No--
    Let me but fire the pile, and share it with you.                   370

    _Myr._ That _duty's_ mine.

    _Pan._                    A woman's!

    _Myr._                              'Tis the soldier's
    Part to die _for_ his sovereign, and why not
    The woman's with her lover?

    _Pan._                     'Tis most strange!

    _Myr._ But not so rare, my Pania, as thou think'st it.
    In the mean time, live thou.--Farewell! the pile
    Is ready.

    _Pan._     I should shame to leave my sovereign
    With but a single female to partake
    His death.

    _Sar._     Too many far have heralded
    Me to the dust already. Get thee hence;
    Enrich thee.

    _Pan._      And live wretched!

    _Sar._                        Think upon                           380
    Thy vow:--'tis sacred and irrevocable.

    _Pan._ Since it is so, farewell.

    _Sar._                            Search well my chamber,
    Feel no remorse at bearing off the gold;
    Remember, what you leave you leave the slaves
    Who slew me: and when you have borne away
    All safe off to your boats, blow one long blast
    Upon the trumpet as you quit the palace.
    The river's brink is too remote, its stream
    Too loud at present to permit the echo
    To reach distinctly from its banks. Then fly,--                    390
    And as you sail, turn back; but still keep on
    Your way along the Euphrates: if you reach
    The land of Paphlagonia, where the Queen
    Is safe with my three sons in Cotta's court,
    Say what you _saw_ at parting, and request
    That she remember what I _said_ at one
    Parting more mournful still.

    _Pan._                      That royal hand!
    Let me then once more press it to my lips;
    And these poor soldiers who throng round you, and
    Would fain die with you!

                             [_The Soldiers and_ PANIA _throng round him,
                               kissing his hand and the hem of his robe_.

    _Sar._                    My best! my last friends!                400
    Let's not unman each other: part at once:
    All farewells should be sudden, when for ever,
    Else they make an eternity of moments,
    And clog the last sad sands of life with tears.
    Hence, and be happy: trust me, I am not
    _Now_ to be pitied; or far more for what
    Is past than present;--for the future, 'tis
    In the hands of the deities, if such
    There be: I shall know soon. Farewell--Farewell.
                                           [_Exeunt_ PANIA _and Soldiers_.

    _Myr._ These men were honest: it is comfort still                  410
    That our last looks should be on loving faces.

    _Sar._ And _lovely_ ones, my beautiful!--but hear me!
    If at this moment,--for we now are on
    The brink,--thou feel'st an inward shrinking from
    This leap through flame into the future, say it:
    I shall not love thee less; nay, perhaps more,
    For yielding to thy nature: and there's time
    Yet for thee to escape hence.

    _Myr._                      Shall I light
    One of the torches which lie heaped beneath
    The ever-burning lamp that burns without,                          420
    Before Baal's shrine, in the adjoining hall?

    _Sar._ Do so. Is that thy answer?

    _Myr._                             Thou shalt see.
                                                           [_Exit_ MYRRHA.

    _Sar._ (_solus_). She's firm. My fathers! whom I will rejoin,
    It may be, purified by death from some
    Of the gross stains of too material being,
    I would not leave your ancient first abode
    To the defilement of usurping bondmen;
    If I have not kept your inheritance
    As ye bequeathed it, this bright part of it,
    Your treasure--your abode--your sacred relics                      430
    Of arms, and records--monuments, and spoils,
    In which _they_ would have revelled, I bear with me
    To you in that absorbing element,
    Which most personifies the soul as leaving
    The least of matter unconsumed before
    Its fiery workings:--and the light of this
    Most royal of funereal pyres shall be[aq]
    Not a mere pillar formed of cloud and flame,
    A beacon in the horizon for a day,
    And then a mount of ashes--but a light[ar]                         440
    To lesson ages, rebel nations, and
    Voluptuous princes. Time shall quench full many
    A people's records, and a hero's acts;
    Sweep empire after empire, like this first
    Of empires, into nothing; but even then
    Shall spare this deed of mine, and hold it up
    A problem few dare imitate, and none
    Despise--but, it may be, avoid the life
    Which led to such a consummation.

            MYRRHA _returns with a lighted Torch in one Hand,
                         and a Cup in the other_.

    _Myr._                           Lo!
    I've lit the lamp which lights us to the stars.                    450

    _Sar._ And the cup?

    _Myr._              'Tis my country's custom to
    Make a libation to the Gods.

    _Sar._                     And mine
    To make libations amongst men. I've not
    Forgot the custom; and although alone,
    Will drain one draught in memory of many
    A joyous banquet past.

                        [SARDANAPALUS _takes the cup, and after drinking
                         and tinkling the reversed cup, as a drop falls,
                         exclaims_--

                           And this libation
    Is for the excellent Beleses.

    _Myr._                       Why
    Dwells thy mind rather upon that man's name
    Than on his mate's in villany?

    _Sar._                        The other
    Is a mere soldier, a mere tool, a kind                             460
    Of human sword in a friend's hand; the other
    Is master-mover of his warlike puppet;
    But I dismiss them from my mind.--Yet pause,
    My Myrrha! dost thou truly follow me,
    Freely and fearlessly?

    _Myr._                And dost thou think
    A Greek girl dare not do for love, that which
    An Indian widow braves for custom?[as]

    _Sar._                                Then
    We but await the signal.

    _Myr._                  It is long
    In sounding.

    _Sar._      Now, farewell; one last embrace.

    _Myr._ Embrace, but _not_ the last; there is one more.             470

    _Sar._ True, the commingling fire will mix our ashes.

    _Myr._ And pure as is my love to thee, shall they,
    Purged from the dross of earth, and earthly passion,
    Mix pale with thine. A single thought yet irks me.

    _Sar._ Say it.

    _Myr._         It is that no kind hand will gather
    The dust of both into one urn.

    _Sar._                     The better:
    Rather let them be borne abroad upon
    The winds of heaven, and scattered into air,
    Than be polluted more by human hands
    Of slaves and traitors. In this blazing palace,                    480
    And its enormous walls of reeking ruin,
    We leave a nobler monument than Egypt
    Hath piled in her brick mountains, o'er dead kings,[32]
    Or _kine_--for none know whether those proud piles
    Be for their monarch, or their ox-god Apis:
    So much for monuments that have forgotten
    Their very record!

    _Myr._            Then farewell, thou earth!
    And loveliest spot of earth! farewell, Ionia!
    Be thou still free and beautiful, and far
    Aloof from desolation! My last prayer                              490
    Was for thee, my last thoughts, save _one_, were of thee!

    _Sar._ And that?

    _Sar._                               Adieu, Assyria!
    I loved thee well, my own, my fathers' land,
    And better as my country than my kingdom.
    I sated thee with peace and joys; and this
    Is my reward! and now I owe thee nothing,
    Not even a grave.                               [_He mounts the pile_.

"Another king of the sort was Sardanapalus.... And so, when Arbaces, who
was one of the generals under him, a Mede by birth, endeavoured to
manage by the assistance of one of the eunuchs, whose name was
Sparamizus, to see Sardanapalus: and when ... he saw him painted with
vermilion, and adorned like a woman, sitting among his concubines,
carding purple wool, and sitting among them with his feet up, wearing a
woman's robe, and with his beard carefully scraped, and his face
smoothed with pumice stone (for he was whiter than milk, and pencilled
under his eyes and eyebrows; and when he saw Arbaces he was putting a
little more white under his eyes). Most historians, of whom Duris is
one, relate that Arbaces, being indignant at his countrymen being ruled
over by such a monarch as that, stabbed him and slew him. But Ctesias
says that he went to war with him, and collected a great army, and then
that Sardanapalus, being dethroned by Arbaces, died, burning himself
alive in his palace, having heaped up a funeral pile four plethra in
extent, on which he placed 150 golden couches."--_The Deipnosophistæ_

[5] {13}[This prince surpassed all his predecessors in effeminacy,
luxury, and cowardice. He never went out of his palace, but spent all
his time among a company of women, dressed and painted like them, and
employed like them at the distaff. He placed all his happiness and glory
in the possession of immense treasures, in feasting and rioting, and
indulging himself in all the most infamous and criminal pleasures. He
ordered two verses to be put upon his tomb, signifying that he carried
away with him all he had eaten, and all the pleasures he had enjoyed,
but left everything else behind him,--_an epitaph_, says Aristotle, _fit
for a hog_. Arbaces, governor of Media, having found means to get into
the palace, and having with his own eyes seen Sardanapalus in the midst
of his infamous seraglio, enraged at such a spectacle, and not able to
endure that so many brave men should be subjected to a prince more soft
and effeminate than the women themselves, immediately formed a
conspiracy against him. Beleses, governor of Babylon, and several
others, entered into it. On the first rumour of this revolt the king hid
himself in the inmost part of his palace. Being afterwards obliged to
take the field with some forces which he had assembled, he at first
gained three successive victories over the enemy, but was afterwards
overcome, and pursued to the gates of Nineveh; wherein he shut himself,
in hopes the rebels would never be able to take a city so well
fortified, and stored with provisions for a considerable time. The siege
proved indeed of very great length. It had been declared by an ancient
oracle that Nineveh could never be taken unless the river became an
enemy to the city. These words buoyed up Sardanapalus, because he looked
upon the thing as impossible. But when he saw that the Tigris, by a
violent inundation, had thrown down twenty stadia (two miles and a half)
of the city wall, and by that means opened a passage to the enemy, he
understood the meaning of the oracle, and thought himself lost. He
resolved, however, to die in such a manner as, according to his opinion,
should cover the infamy of his scandalous and effeminate life. He
ordered a pile of wood to be made in his palace, and, setting fire to
it, burnt himself, his eunuchs, his women, and his treasures.--Diod.
Sic., _Bibl. Hist_., lib. ii. pag. 78, sqq., ed. 1604, p. 109.]

[6] ["The words _Queen_ (_vide infra_, line 83) and _pavilion_ occur,
but it is not an allusion to his Britannic Majesty, as you may
tremulously (for the admiralty custom) imagine. This you will one day
see (if I finish it), as I have made Sardanapalus _brave_ (though
voluptuous, as history represents him), and also as _amiable_ as my poor
powers could render him. So that it could neither be truth nor satire on
any living monarch."--Letter to Murray, May 25, 1821, _Letters_, 1901,
v. 299.

Byron pretended, or, perhaps, really thought, that such a phrase as the
"Queen's wrongs" would be supposed to contain an allusion to the trial
of Queen Caroline (August-November, 1820), and to the exclusion of her
name from the State prayers, etc. Unquestionably if the play had been
put on the stage at this time, the pit and gallery would have applauded
the sentiment to the echo. There was, too, but one "pavilion" in 1821,
and that was not on the banks of the Euphrates, but at Brighton. _Qui
s'excuse s'accuse_. Byron was not above "paltering" with his readers "in
a double sense."]

the Greeks."--MITFORD'S _Greece_, 1818. i. 199.

[9] [Strabo (_Rerum Geog_., lib. iii. 1807, p. 235) throws some doubt on
the existence of these columns, which he suggests were islands or
"pillar" rocks. According to Plutarch (Langhorne's Translation, 1838, p.
490), Alexander built great altars on the banks of the Ganges, on which
the native kings were wont to "offer sacrifices in the Grecian manner."
Hence, perhaps, the legend of the columns erected by Dionysus.]

[10] "For this expedition he took only a small chosen body of the
phalanx, but all his light troops. In the first day's march he reached
Anchialus, a town said to have been founded by the king of Assyria,
Sardanapalus. The fortifications, in their magnitude and extent, still
in Arrian's time, bore the character of greatness, which the Assyrians
appear singularly to have affected in works of the kind. A monument
representing Sardanapalus was found there, warranted by an inscription
in Assyrian characters, of course in the old Assyrian language, which
the Greeks, whether well or ill, interpreted thus: 'Sardanapalus, son of
Anacyndaraxes, in one day founded Anchialus and Tarsus. Eat, drink,
play; all other human joys are not worth a fillip.' Supposing this
version nearly exact (for Arrian says it was not quite so), whether the
purpose has not been to invite to civil order a people disposed to
turbulence, rather than to recommend immoderate luxury, may perhaps
reasonably be questioned. What, indeed, could be the object of a king of
Assyria in founding such towns in a country so distant from his capital,
and so divided from it by an immense extent of sandy deserts and lofty
mountains, and, still more, how the inhabitants could be at once in
circumstances to abandon themselves to the intemperate joys which their
prince has been supposed to have recommended, is not obvious. But it may
deserve observation that, in that line of coast, the southern of Lesser
Asia, ruins of cities, evidently of an age after Alexander, yet barely
named in history, at this day astonish the adventurous traveller by
their magnificence and elegance amid the desolation which, under a
singularly barbarian government, has for so many centuries been daily
spreading in the finest countries of the globe. Whether more from soil
and climate, or from opportunities for commerce, extraordinary means
must have been found for communities to flourish there; whence it may
seem that the measures of Sardanapalus were directed by juster views
than have been commonly ascribed to him. But that monarch having been
the last of a dynasty ended by a revolution, obloquy on his memory would
follow of course from the policy of his successors and their partisans.
The inconsistency of traditions concerning Sardanapalus is striking in
Diodorus's account of him."--MITFORD's _Greece_, 1820, ix. 311-313, and
note 1.

[The story of the sepulchral monument with its cynical inscription rests
on the authority of Aristobulus, who served under Alexander, and wrote
his history. The passage is quoted by Strabo (lib. xiv. ed. 1808, p.
958), and as follows by Athenæus (lib. xii. cap. 40) in the
_Deipnosophistæ_: "And Aristobulus says, 'In Anchiale, which was built
by Sardanapalus, did Alexander, when he was on his expedition against
the Persians, pitch his camp. And at no great distance was the monument
of Sardanapalus, on which there is a marble figure putting together the
fingers of its right hand, as if it were giving a fillip. And there was
on it the following inscription in Assyrian characters:--

                 Sardanapalus
        The king, and son of Anacyndaraxes,
        In one day built Anchiale and Tarsus:
    Eat, drink, and love, the rest's not worth e'en this.'

By '_this_' meaning the fillip he was giving with his fingers."

"We may conjecture," says Canon Rawlinson, "that the monument was in
reality a stele containing the king [Sennacherib] in an arched frame,
with the right hand raised above the left, which is the ordinary
attitude, and an inscription commemorating the occasion of its erection"
[the conquest of Cilicia and settlement of Tarsus].--_The Five Great
Monarchies, etc._, 1871, ii. 216.]

    "The appearance, instantaneously disclosed,
    Was of a mighty city--boldly say
    A wilderness of building, sinking far
    And self-withdrawn into a boundless depth,
    Far sinking into splendour--without end!
    Fabric it seemed of diamond and of gold,
    With alabaster domes, and silver spires,
    And blazing terrace upon terrace, high
    Uplifted."

But the difference, even in form, between the two passages is more
remarkable than the resemblance, and the interpretation, the moral of
Byron's vision is distinct from, if not alien to, Wordsworth's. The
"Solitary" sees all heaven opened; the revealed abode of spirits in
beatitude--a refuge and a redemption from "this low world of care;"
while Myrrha drinks in "enough of heaven," a medicament of "Sorrow and
of Love," for the invigoration of "the common, heavy, human hours" of
mortal existence. For a charge of "imitation," see _Works of Lord

                    INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_


The _Two Foscari_ was begun on June 12, and finished, within the month,
on July 9, 1821. Byron was still in the vein of the historic drama,
though less concerned with "ancient chroniclers" and original
"authorities" (_vide ante_, Preface to _Marino Faliero_, vol. iv. p. 332)
than heretofore. "The Venetian play," he tells Murray, July 14, 1821, is
"rigidly historical;" but he seems to have depended for his facts, not
on Sanudo or Navagero, but on Daru's _Histoire de la République de
Vénise_ (1821, ii. 520-537), and on Sismondi's _Histoire des Républiques
... du Moyen Age_ (1815, x. 36-46). The story of the Two Doges, so far
as it concerns the characters and action of Byron's play, may be briefly
re-told. It will be found to differ in some important particulars from
the extracts from Daru and Sismondi which Byron printed in his "Appendix
to the _Two Foscari_" (_Sardanapalus, etc._, 1821, pp. 305-324), and no
less from a passage in Smedley's _Sketches from Venetian History_ (1832,
ii. 93-105), which was substituted for the French "Pièces
justificatives," in the collected edition of 1832-1835, xiii. 198-202,
and the octavo edition of 1837, etc., pp. 790, 791.

Francesco, son of Nicolò Foscari, was born in 1373. He was nominated a
member of the Council of Ten in 1399, and, after holding various offices
of state, elected Doge in 1423. His dukedom, the longest on record,
lasted till 1457. He was married, in 1395, to Maria, daughter of Andrea
Priuli, and, _en secondes noces_, to Maria, or Marina, daughter of
Bartolommeo Nani. By his two wives he was the father of ten
children--five sons and five daughters. Of the five sons, four died of
the plague, and the fifth, Jacopo, lived to be the cause, if not the
hero, of a tragedy.

The younger of the "Two Foscari" was a man of some cultivation, a
collector and student of Greek manuscripts, well-mannered, and of ready
wit, a child and lover of Venice, but indifferent to her ideals and
regardless of her prejudices and restrictions. He seems to have begun
life in a blaze of popularity, the admired of all admirers. His wedding
with Lucrezia Contarini (January, 1441) was celebrated with a novel and
peculiar splendour. Gorgeous youths, Companions of the Hose (_della
calza_), in jackets of crimson velvet, with slashed sleeves lined with
squirrel fur, preceded and followed the bridegroom's train. A hundred
bridesmaids accompanied the bride. Her dowry exceeded 16,000 ducats, and
her jewels, which included a necklace worn by a Queen of Cyprus, were
"rich and rare." And the maiden herself was a pearl of great price. "She
behaved," writes her brother, "and does behave, so well beyond what
could have been looked for. I believe she is inspired by God!"

Jacopo had everything which fortune could bestow, but he lacked a
capacity for right conduct. Four years after his marriage (February 17,
1445) an accusation was laid before the Ten (Romanin, _Storia_, etc.,
iv. 266) that, contrary to the law embodied in the Ducal _Promissione_,
he had accepted gifts of jewels and money, not only from his
fellow-citizens, but from his country's bitterest enemy, Filippo
Visconti, Duke of Milan. Jacopo fled to Trieste, and in his absence the
Ten, supported by a giunta of ten, on their own authority and
independently of the Doge, sentenced him to perpetual banishment at
Nauplia, in Roumania. One of the three _Capi di' dieci_ was Ermolao (or
_Veneticé_ Almoro) Donato, of whom more hereafter. It is to be noted
that this sentence was never carried into effect. At the end of four
months, thanks to the intervention of five members of the Ten, he was
removed from Trieste to Treviso, and, two years later (September 13,
1447), out of consideration to the Doge, who pleaded that the exile of
his only son prevented him from giving his whole heart and soul to the
Republic, permitted to return to Venice. So ends the first chapter of
Jacopo's misadventures. He stands charged with unlawful, if not
criminal, appropriation of gifts and moneys. He had been punished, but
less than he deserved, and, for his father's sake, the sentence of exile
had been altogether remitted.

Three years went by, and once again, January, 1451, a charge was
preferred against Jacopo Foscari, and on this occasion he was arrested
and brought before the Ten. He was accused of being implicated in the
murder of Ermolao Donato, who was assassinated November 5, 1450, on
leaving the Ducal Palace, where he had been attending the Council of the
Pregadi. On the morning after the murder Benedetto Gritti, one of the
"avvogadori di Commun," was at Mestre, some five miles from Venice, and,
happening to accost a servant of Jacopo's who was loading a barge with
wood, asked for the latest news from Venice, and got as answer, "Donato
has been murdered!" The possession of the news some hours before it had
been made public, and the fact that the newsmonger had been haunting
the purlieus of the Ducal Palace on the previous afternoon, enabled the
Ten to convict Jacopo. They alleged (Decree of X., March 26, 1451) that
other evidence ("_testificationes et scripturæ_") was in their
possession, and they pointed to the prisoner's obstinate silence on the
rack--a silence unbroken save by "several incantations and magic words
which fell from him," as a confirmation of his guilt. Moreover, it was
"for the advantage of the State from many points of view" that convicted
and condemned he should be. The question of his innocence or guilt
(complicated by the report or tradition that one Nicolò Erizzo confessed
on his death-bed that he had assassinated Donato for reasons of his own)
is still under discussion. Berlan (_I due Foscari_, etc., 1852, p. 36)
sums up against him. It may, however, be urged in favour of Jacopo that
the Ten did not produce or quote the _scripturæ et testificationes_
which convinced them of his guilt; that they stopped short of the
death-penalty, and pronounced a sentence inadequate to the crime; and,
lastly, that not many years before they had taken into consideration the
possibility and advisability of poisoning Filippo Visconti, an event
which would, no doubt, have been "to the advantage of the State from
many points of view."

Innocent or guilty, he was sentenced to perpetual banishment to the city
of Candia, on the north coast of the island of Crete; and, guilty or
innocent, Jacopo was not the man to make the best of what remained to
him and submit to fate. Intrigue he must, and, five years later (June,
1456), a report reached Venice that papers had been found in his
possession, some relating to the Duke of Milan, calculated to excite
"nuovi scandali e disordini," and others in cypher, which the Ten
could not read. Over and above these papers there was direct evidence
that Jacopo had written to the _Imperatore dei Turchi_, imploring him to
send his galley and take him away from Candia. Here was a fresh instance
of treachery to the Republic, and, July 21, 1456, Jacopo returned to
Venice under the custody of Lorenzo Loredano.

According to Romanin (_Storia, etc._, iv. 284), he was not put to the
torture, but confessed his guilt spontaneously, pleading, by way of
excuse, that the letter to the Duke of Milan had been allowed to fall
into the hands of spies, with a view to his being recalled to Venice and
obtaining a glimpse of his parents and family, even at a risk of a fresh
trial. On the other hand, the _Dolfin Cronaca_, the work of a kinsman of
the Foscari, which records Jacopo's fruitless appeal to the sorrowful
but inexorable Doge, and other incidents of a personal nature,
testifies, if not to torture on the rack, "to mutilation by thirty
strokes of the lash." Be that as it may, he was once more condemned to
lifelong exile, with the additional penalty that he should be imprisoned
for a year. He sailed for Venice July 31, 1456, and died at Candia,
January 12, 1457. Jacopo's misconduct and consequent misfortune
overshadowed the splendour of his father's reign, and, in very truth
"brought his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."

After his son's death, the aged Doge, now in his eighty-fifth year,
retired to his own apartments, and refused to preside at Councils of
State. The Ten, who in 1446 had yielded to the Doge's plea that a father
fretting for an exiled son could not discharge his public duties, were
instant that he should abdicate the dukedom on the score of decrepitude.
Accounts differ as to the mode in which he received the sentence of
deposition. It is certain that he was compelled to abdicate on Sunday
morning, October 23, 1457, but was allowed a breathing-space of a few
days to make his arrangements for quitting the Ducal Palace.

On Monday, October 24, the Great Council met to elect his successor, and
sat with closed doors till Sunday, October 30.

On Thursday, October 27, Francesco, heedless of a suggestion that he
should avoid the crowd, descended the Giants' Staircase for the last
time, and, says the _Dolfin Cronaca_, "after crossing the courtyard,
went out by the door leading to the prisons, and entered his boat by the
Ponte di Paglia." "He was dressed," says another chronicle (_August.
Cod._ I, cl. vii.), "in a scarlet mantle, from which the fur lining had
been taken," surmounted by a scarlet hood, an old friend which he had
worn when his ducal honours were new, and which he had entrusted to his
wife's care to be preserved for "red" days and festivals of State. "In
his hand he held his staff, as he walked very slowly. His brother Marco
was by his side, behind him were cousins and grandsons ... and in this
way he went to his own house."

On Sunday, October 30, Pasquale Malipiero was declared Doge, and two
days after, All Saints' Day, at the first hour of the morning, Francesco
Foscari died. If the interval between ten o'clock on Sunday night and
one o'clock on Tuesday morning disproves the legend that the discrowned
Doge ruptured a blood-vessel at the moment when the bell was tolling for
the election of his successor, the truth remains that, old as he was, he
died of a broken heart.

His predecessor, Tomaso Mocenigo, had prophesied on his death-bed that
if the Venetians were to make Foscari Doge they would forfeit their
"gold and silver, their honour and renown." "From your position of
lords," said he, "you will sink to that of vassals and servants to men
of arms." The prophecy was fulfilled. "If we look," writes Mr. H. F.
Brown (_Venice, etc._, 1893, p. 306), "at the sum-total of Foscari's reign
... we find that the Republic had increased her land territory by the
addition of two great provinces, Bergamo and Brescia ... But the price
had been enormous ... her debt rose from 6,000,000 to 13,000,000 ducats.
Venetian funds fell to 18-1/2.... Externally there was much pomp and
splendour.... But underneath this bravery there lurked the official
corruption of the nobles, the suspicion of the Ten, the first signs of
bank failures, the increase in the national debt, the fall in the value
of the funds. Land wars and landed possessions drew the Venetians from
the sea to _terra ferma_.... The beginning of the end had arrived." (See
_Two Doges of Venice_, by Alethea Wiel, 1891; _I due Foscari, Memorie
Storicho Critiche_, di Francesco Berlan, 1852; _Storia Documentata di
Venezia_, di S. Romanin, 1855, vol. iv.; _Die beiden Foscari_, von
Richard Senger, 1878. For reviews, etc., of _The Two Foscari, vide
ante_, "Introduction to _Sardanapalus_," p. 5.)

Both Jeffrey in the _Edinburgh_, and Heber in the _Quarterly Review_,
took exception to the character of Jacopo Foscari, in accordance with
the Horatian maxim, "Incredulus odi." "If," said Jeffrey, "he had been
presented to the audience wearing out his heart in exile, ... we might
have caught some glimpse of the nature of his motives." As it is (in
obedience to the "unities") "we first meet with him led from the
'Question,' and afterwards ... clinging to the dungeon walls of his
native city, and expiring from his dread of leaving them." The situation
lacks conviction.

"If," argued Heber, "there ever existed in nature a case so
extraordinary as that of a man who gravely preferred tortures and a
dungeon at home, to a temporary residence in a beautiful island and a
fine climate; it is what few can be made to believe, and still fewer to
sympathize with."

It was, no doubt, with reference to these criticisms that Byron told
Medwin (_Conversations_, 1824, p. 173) that it was no invention of his
that the "young Foscari should have a sickly affection for his native
city.... I painted the men as I found them, as they were--not as the
critics would have them.... But no painting, however highly coloured,
can give an idea of the intensity of a Venetian's affection for his
native city."

Goethe, on the other hand, was "not careful" to note these
inconsistencies and perplexities. He thought that the dramatic handling
of _The Two Foscari_ was "worthy of great praise," was "admirable!"
(_Conversations with Goethe_, 1874, p. 265).

    SCENE--The Ducal Palace, Venice.




                             THE TWO FOSCARI.


                                  ACT I.


                 SCENE I.--_A Hall in the Ducal Palace_.

               _Enter_ LOREDANO _and_ BARBARIGO, _meeting_.

    _Lor._ WHERE is the prisoner?

    _Bar._                        Reposing from
    The Question.

    _Lor._        The hour's past--fixed yesterday
    For the resumption of his trial.--Let us
    Rejoin our colleagues in the council, and
    Urge his recall.

    _Bar._          Nay, let him profit by
    A few brief minutes for his tortured limbs;
    He was o'erwrought by the Question yesterday,
    And may die under it if now repeated.[at][37]

    _Lor._ Well?

    _Bar._      I yield not to you in love of justice,
    Or hate of the ambitious Foscari,                                   10
    Father and son, and all their noxious race;
    But the poor wretch has suffered beyond Nature's
    Most stoical endurance.

    _Lor._                 Without owning
    His crime?

    _Bar._    Perhaps without committing any.
    But he avowed the letter to the Duke
    Of Milan, and his sufferings half atone for
    Such weakness.

    _Lor._        We shall see.

    _Bar._                     You, Loredano,
    Pursue hereditary hate too far.

    _Lor._ How far?

    _Bar._         To extermination.

    _Lor._                           When they are
    Extinct, you may say this.--Let's in to council.                    20

    _Bar._ Yet pause--the number of our colleagues is not
    Complete yet; two are wanting ere we can
    Proceed.

    _Lor._   And the chief judge, the Doge?

    _Bar._                                 No--he,
    With more than Roman fortitude, is ever
    First at the board in this unhappy process
    Against his last and only son.[38]

    _Lor._                         True--true--
    His _last_.

    _Bar._   Will nothing move you?

    _Lor._                        _Feels he_, think you?

    _Bar._ He shows it not.

    _Lor._                 I have marked _that_--the wretch!

    _Bar._ But yesterday, I hear, on his return
    To the ducal chambers, as he passed the threshold                   30
    The old man fainted.

    _Lor._             It begins to work, then.

    _Bar._ The work is half your own.

    _Lor._                           And should be _all_ mine--
    My father and my uncle are no more.

    _Bar._ I have read their epitaph, which says they died
    By poison.[39]

    _Lor._      When the Doge declared that he
    Should never deem himself a sovereign till
    The death of Peter Loredano, both
    The brothers sickened shortly:--he _is_ Sovereign.

    _Bar._ A wretched one.

    _Lor._                What should they be who make
    Orphans?

    _Bar._ But _did_ the Doge make you so?

    _Lor._                                Yes.                        40

    _Bar._ What solid proofs?

    _Lor._                   When Princes set themselves
    To work in secret, proofs and process are
    Alike made difficult; but I have such
    Of the first, as shall make the second needless.

    _Bar._ But you will move by law?

    _Lor._                          By all the laws
    Which he would leave us.

    _Bar._                  They are such in this
    Our state as render retribution easier
    Than 'mongst remoter nations. Is it true
    That you have written in your books of commerce,
    (The wealthy practice of our highest nobles)                        50
    "Doge Foscari, my debtor for the deaths
    Of Marco and Pietro Loredano,
    My sire and uncle?"[40]

    _Lor._             It is written thus.

    _Bar._ And will you leave it unerased?

    _Lor._                                  Till balanced.

    _Bar._ And how?

                     [_Two Senators pass over the stage, as in their way
                         to "the Hall of the Council of Ten."_

    _Lor._          You see the number is complete.
    Follow me.                                           [_Exit_ LOREDANO.

    _Bar._ (_solus_). Follow _thee_! I have followed long
    Thy path of desolation, as the wave
    Sweeps after that before it, alike whelming[au]
    The wreck that creaks to the wild winds, and wretch
    Who shrieks within its riven ribs, as gush                          60
    The waters through them; but this son and sire
    Might move the elements to pause, and yet
    Must I on hardily like them--Oh! would
    I could as blindly and remorselessly!--
    Lo, where he comes!--Be still, my heart! they are
    Thy foes, must be thy victims: wilt thou beat
    For those who almost broke thee?

          _Enter Guards, with young_ FOSCARI _as Prisoner, etc._

    _Guard_.                         Let him rest.
    Signor, take time.

    _Jac. Fos._        I thank thee, friend, I'm feeble;
    But thou mayst stand reproved.

    _Guard_.                      I'll stand the hazard.

    _Jac. Fos._ That's kind:--I meet some pity, but no mercy;[av]       70
    This is the first.

    _Guard_.          And might be the last, did they
    Who rule behold us.

    _Bar._ (_advancing to the Guard_). There is one who does:
    Yet fear not; I will neither be thy judge
    Nor thy accuser; though the hour is past,
    Wait their last summons--I am of "the Ten,"[41]
    And waiting for that summons, sanction you
    Even by my presence: when the last call sounds,
    We'll in together.--Look well to the prisoner!

    _Jac. Fos._ What voice is that?--'Tis Barbarigo's! Ah!
    Our House's foe, and one of my few judges.                          80

    _Bar._ To balance such a foe, if such there be,
    Thy father sits amongst thy judges.

    _Jac. Fos._                         True,
    He judges.

    _Bar._      Then deem not the laws too harsh
    Which yield so much indulgence to a sire,
    As to allow his voice in such high matter
    As the state's safety--

    _Jac. Fos._           And his son's. I'm faint;
    Let me approach, I pray you, for a breath
    Of air, yon window which o'erlooks the waters.

    _Enter an Officer, who whispers_ BARBARIGO.

    _Bar._ (to the Guard). Let him approach. I must not speak with him
    Further than thus: I have transgressed my duty                      90
    In this brief parley, and must now redeem it[aw]
    Within the Council Chamber.                         [_Exit_ BARBARIGO.

                       [_Guard conducting_ JACOPO FOSCARI _to the window_.

    _Guard_.                  There, sir, 'tis
    Open.--How feel you?

    _Jac. Fos._         Like a boy--Oh Venice!

    _Guard_. And your limbs?

    _Jac. Fos._            Limbs! how often have they borne me[42]
    Bounding o'er yon blue tide, as I have skimmed
    The gondola along in childish race,
    And, masqued as a young gondolier, amidst
    My gay competitors, noble as I,
    Raced for our pleasure, in the pride of strength;
    While the fair populace of crowding beauties,                      100
    Plebeian as patrician, cheered us on
    With dazzling smiles, and wishes audible,
    And waving kerchiefs, and applauding hands,
    Even to the goal!--How many a time have I
    Cloven with arm still lustier, breast more daring,
    The wave all roughened; with a swimmer's stroke
    Flinging the billows back from my drenched hair,
    And laughing from my lip the audacious brine,
    Which kissed it like a wine-cup, rising o'er
    The waves as they arose, and prouder still                         110
    The loftier they uplifted me; and oft,
    In wantonness of spirit, plunging down
    Into their green and glassy gulfs, and making
    My way to shells and sea-weed, all unseen
    By those above, till they waxed fearful; then
    Returning with my grasp full of such tokens
    As showed that I had searched the deep: exulting,
    With a far-dashing stroke, and, drawing deep
    The long-suspended breath, again I spurned
    The foam which broke around me, and pursued                        120
    My track like a sea-bird.--I was a boy then.

    _Guard_. Be a man now: there never was more need
    Of manhood's strength.

    _Jac. Fos._ (_looking from the lattice_). My beautiful, my own,
    My only Venice--_this is breath_! Thy breeze,
    Thine Adrian sea-breeze, how it fans my face!
    Thy very winds feel native to my veins,
    And cool them into calmness! How unlike
    The hot gales of the horrid Cyclades,
    Which howled about my Candiote dungeon,[43] and
    Made my heart sick.

    _Guard_.           I see the colour comes[ax]                      130
    Back to your cheek: Heaven send you strength to bear
    What more may be imposed!--I dread to think on't.

    _Jac. Fos._ They will not banish me again?--No--no,
    Let them wring on; I am strong yet.

    _Guard_.                           Confess,
    And the rack will be spared you.

    _Jac. Fos._                     I confessed
    Once--twice before: both times they exiled me.

    _Guard_. And the third time will slay you.

    _Jac. Fos._                              Let them do so,
    So I be buried in my birth-place: better
    Be ashes here than aught that lives elsewhere.

    _Guard_. And can you so much love the soil which hates you?        140

    _Jac. Fos._ The soil!--Oh no, it is the seed of the soil
    Which persecutes me: but my native earth
    Will take me as a mother to her arms.
    I ask no more than a Venetian grave,
    A dungeon, what they will, so it be here.

                           _Enter an Officer_.

    _Offi._ Bring in the prisoner!

    _Guard_.                       Signor, you hear the order.

    _Jac. Fos._ Aye, I am used to such a summons; 'tis
    The third time they have tortured me:--then lend me
    Thine arm.                                            [_To the Guard_.

    _Offi._   Take mine, sir; 'tis my duty to
    Be nearest to your person.

    _Jac. Fos._               You!--you are he                         150
    Who yesterday presided o'er my pangs--
    Away!--I'll walk alone.

    _Offi._                As you please, Signor;
    The sentence was not of my signing, but
    I dared not disobey the Council when
    They----

    _Jac. Fos._ Bade thee stretch me on their horrid engine.
    I pray thee touch me not--that is, just now;
    The time will come they will renew that order,
    But keep off from me till 'tis issued. As
    I look upon thy hands my curdling limbs
    Quiver with the anticipated wrenching,                             160
    And the cold drops strain through my brow, as if----
    But onward--I have borne it--I can bear it.--
    How looks my father?

    _Offi._             With his wonted aspect.

    _Jac. Fos._ So does the earth, and sky, the blue of Ocean,
    The brightness of our city, and her domes,
    The mirth of her Piazza--even now
    Its merry hum of nations pierces here,
    Even here, into these chambers of the unknown
    Who govern, and the unknown and the unnumbered
    Judged and destroyed in silence,--all things wear                  170
    The self-same aspect, to my very sire!
    Nothing can sympathise with Foscari,
    Not even a Foscari.--Sir, I attend you.
                                 [_Exeunt_ JACOPO FOSCARI, _Officer, etc._

                   _Enter_ MEMMO _and another Senator_.

    _Mem._ He's gone--we are too late:--think you "the Ten"
    Will sit for any length of time to-day?

    _Sen._ They say the prisoner is most obdurate,
    Persisting in his first avowal; but
    More I know not.

    _Mem._          And that is much; the secrets
    Of yon terrific chamber are as hidden
    From us, the premier nobles of the state,                          180
    As from the people.

    _Sen._             Save the wonted rumours,
    Which--like the tales of spectres, that are rife
    Near ruined buildings--never have been proved,
    Nor wholly disbelieved: men know as little
    Of the state's real acts as of the grave's
    Unfathomed mysteries.

    _Mem._               But with length of time
    We gain a step in knowledge, and I look
    Forward to be one day of the decemvirs.

    _Sen._ Or Doge?

    _Mem._         Why, no; not if I can avoid it.

    _Sen._ 'Tis the first station of the state, and may                190
    Be lawfully desired, and lawfully
    Attained by noble aspirants.

    _Mem._                      To such
    I leave it; though born noble, my ambition
    Is limited: I'd rather be an unit
    Of an united and Imperial "Ten,"
    Than shine a lonely, though a gilded cipher.--
    Whom have we here? the wife of Foscari?

                _Enter_ MARINA, _with a female Attendant_.

    _Mar._ What, no one?--I am wrong, there still are two;
    But they are senators.

    _Mem._                Most noble lady,
    Command us.

    _Mar._      _I command_!--Alas! my life                            200
    Has been one long entreaty, and a vain one.

    _Mem._ I understand thee, but I must not answer.

    _Mar._ (_fiercely_). True--none dare answer here save on the rack,
    Or question save those----

    _Mem._ (_interrupting her_). High-born dame![44] bethink thee
    Where thou now art.

    _Mar._             Where I now am!--It was
    My husband's father's palace.

    _Mem._                       The Duke's palace.

    _Mar._ And his son's prison!--True, I have not forgot it;
    And, if there were no other nearer, bitterer
    Remembrances, would thank the illustrious Memmo
    For pointing out the pleasures of the place.                       210

    _Mem._ Be calm!

    _Mar._ (_looking up towards heaven_). I am; but oh, thou eternal God!
    Canst _thou_ continue so, with such a world?

    _Mem._ Thy husband yet may be absolved.

    _Mar._                                  He is,
    In Heaven. I pray you, Signer Senator,
    Speak not of that; you are a man of office,
    So is the Doge; he has a son at stake
    Now, at this moment, and I have a husband,
    Or had; they are there within, or were at least
    An hour since, face to face, as judge and culprit:
    Will _he_ condemn _him_?

    _Mem._                         I trust not.

    _Mar._                                     But if                  220
    He does not, there are those will sentence both.

    _Mem._ They can.

    _Mar._           And with them power and will are one
    In wickedness;--my husband's lost!

    _Mem._                            Not so;
    Justice is judge in Venice.

    _Mar._                     If it were so,
    There now would be no Venice. But let it
    Live on, so the good die not, till the hour
    Of Nature's summons; but "the Ten's" is quicker,
    And we must wait on't. Ah! a voice of wail!
                                                    [_A faint cry within_.

    _Sen._ Hark!

    _Mem._      'Twas a cry of--

    _Mar._                       No, no; not my husband's--
    Not Foscari's.

    _Mem._      The voice was--

    _Mar._                    _Not his_: no.                           230
    He shriek! No; that should be his father's part,
    Not his--not his--he'll die in silence.
                                            [_A faint groan again within_.

    _Mem._                                  What!
    Again?

    _Mar._ _His_ voice! it seemed so: I will not
    Believe it. Should he shrink, I cannot cease
    To love; but--no--no--no--it must have been
    A fearful pang, which wrung a groan from him.

    _Sen._ And, feeling for thy husband's wrongs, wouldst thou
    Have him bear more than mortal pain in silence?

    _Mar._ We all must bear our tortures. I have not
    Left barren the great house of Foscari,                            240
    Though they sweep both the Doge and son from life;
    I have endured as much in giving life
    To those who will succeed them, as they can
    In leaving it: but mine were joyful pangs:
    And yet they wrung me till I _could_ have shrieked,
    But did not; for my hope was to bring forth
    Heroes, and would not welcome them with tears.

    _Mem._ All's silent now.

    _Mar._                  Perhaps all's over; but
    I will not deem it: he hath nerved himself,
    And now defies them.

                       _Enter an Officer hastily_.

    _Mem._            How now, friend, what seek you?                  250

    _Offi._ A leech. The prisoner has fainted.            [_Exit Officer_.

    _Mem._                                     Lady,
    'Twere better to retire.

    _Sen._ (_offering to assist her_), I pray thee do so.

    _Mar._ Off! _I_ will tend him.

    _Mem._                        You! Remember, lady!
    Ingress is given to none within those chambers
    Except "the Ten," and their familiars.

    _Mar._                                 Well,
    I know that none who enter there return
    As they have entered--many never; but
    They shall not balk my entrance.

    _Mem._                          Alas! this
    Is but to expose yourself to harsh repulse,
    And worse suspense.

    _Mar._             Who shall oppose me?

    _Mem._                                 They                        260
    Whose duty 'tis to do so.

    _Mar._                   'Tis _their_ duty
    To trample on all human feelings, all
    Ties which bind man to man, to emulate
    The fiends who will one day requite them in
    Variety of torturing! Yet I'll pass.

    _Mem._ It is impossible.

    _Mar._                 That shall be tried.[ay]
    Despair defies even despotism: there is
    That in my heart would make its way through hosts
    With levelled spears; and think you a few jailors
    Shall put me from my path? Give me, then, way;                     270
    This is the Doge's palace; I am wife
    Of the Duke's son, the _innocent_ Duke's son,
    And they shall hear this!

    _Mem._                   It will only serve
    More to exasperate his judges.

    _Mar._                        What
    Are _judges_ who give way to anger? they
    Who do so are assassins. Give me way.                  [_Exit_ MARINA.

    _Sen._ Poor lady!

    _Mem._            'Tis mere desperation: she
    Will not be admitted o'er the threshold.

    _Sen._                                  And
    Even if she be so, cannot save her husband.
    But, see, the officer returns.
                 [_The Officer passes over the stage with another person_.

    _Mem._                        I hardly                             280
    Thought that "the Ten" had even this touch of pity,
    Or would permit assistance to this sufferer.

    _Sen._ Pity! Is't pity to recall to feeling
    The wretch too happy to escape to Death
    By the compassionate trance, poor Nature's last
    Resource against the tyranny of pain?

    _Mem._ I marvel they condemn him not at once.

    _Sen._ That's not their policy: they'd have him live,
    Because he fears not death; and banish him,
    Because all earth, except his native land,                         290
    To him is one wide prison, and each breath
    Of foreign air he draws seems a slow poison,
    Consuming but not killing.

    _Mem._                    Circumstance
    Confirms his crimes, but he avows them not.

    _Sen._ None, save the Letter, which, he says, was written
    Addressed to Milan's duke, in the full knowledge
    That it would fall into the Senate's hands,
    And thus he should be re-conveyed to Venice.[45]

    _Mem._ But as a culprit.

    _Sen._                  Yes, but to his country;
    And that was all he sought,--so he avouches.                       300

    _Mem._ The accusation of the bribes was proved.

    _Sen._ Not clearly, and the charge of homicide
    Has been annulled by the death-bed confession
    Of Nicolas Erizzo, who slew the late
    Chief of "the Ten."[46]

    _Mem._            Then why not clear him?

    _Sen._                                    That
    They ought to answer; for it is well known
    That Almoro Donato, as I said,
    Was slain by Erizzo for private vengeance.

    _Mem._ There must be more in this strange process than
    The apparent crimes of the accused disclose--                      310
    But here come two of "the Ten;" let us retire.
                                            [_Exeunt_ MEMMO _and Senator_.

                    _Enter_ LOREDANO _and_ BARBARIGO.

    _Bar._ (_addressing_ LOR.).
    That were too much: believe me, 'twas not meet
    The trial should go further at this moment.

    _Lor._ And so the Council must break up, and Justice
    Pause in her full career, because a woman
    Breaks in on our deliberations?

    _Bar._                         No,
    That's not the cause; you saw the prisoner's state.

    _Lor._ And had he not recovered?

    _Bar._                           To relapse
    Upon the least renewal.

    _Lor._                 'Twas not tried.

    _Bar._ 'Tis vain to murmur; the majority                           320
    In council were against you.

    _Lor._                      Thanks to _you_, sir,
    And the old ducal dotard, who combined
    The worthy voices which o'er-ruled my own.

    _Bar._ I am a judge; but must confess that part
    Of our stern duty, which prescribes the Question,[47]
    And bids us sit and see its sharp infliction,
    Makes me wish--

    _Lor._          What?

    _Bar._               That _you_ would _sometimes_ feel,
    As I do always.

    _Lor._        Go to, you're a child,
    Infirm of feeling as of purpose, blown
    About by every breath, shook[48] by a sigh,                        330
    And melted by a tear--a precious judge
    For Venice! and a worthy statesman to
    Be partner in my policy.

    _Bar._                  He shed
    No tears.

    _Lor._   He cried out twice.

    _Bar._                      A Saint had done so,
    Even with the crown of Glory in his eye,
    At such inhuman artifice of pain
    As was forced on him; but he did not cry[az]
    For pity; not a word nor groan escaped him,
    And those two shrieks were not in supplication,
    But wrung from pangs, and followed by no prayers.                  340

    _Lor._ He muttered many times between his teeth,
    But inarticulately.[49]

    _Bar._              That I heard not:
    You stood more near him.

    _Lor._                   I did so.

    _Bar._                            Methought,
    To my surprise too, you were touched with mercy,
    And were the first to call out for assistance
    When he was failing.

    _Lor._              I believed that swoon
    His last.

    _Bar._    And have I not oft heard thee name
    His and his father's death your nearest wish?

    _Lor._ If he dies innocent, that is to say,
    With his guilt unavowed, he'll be lamented.                        350

    _Bar._ What, wouldst thou slay his memory?

    _Lor._                                    Wouldst thou have
    His state descend to his children, as it must,
    If he die unattainted?

    _Bar._                War with _them_ too?

    _Lor._ With all their house, till theirs or mine are nothing.

    _Bar._ And the deep agony of his pale wife,
    And the repressed convulsion of the high
    And princely brow of his old father, which
    Broke forth in a slight shuddering, though rarely,
    Or in some clammy drops, soon wiped away
    In stern serenity; these moved you not?                            360
                                                         [_Exit_ LOREDANO.
    He's silent in his hate, as Foscari
    Was in his suffering; and the poor wretch moved me
    More by his silence than a thousand outcries
    Could have effected. 'Twas a dreadful sight
    When his distracted wife broke through into
    The hall of our tribunal, and beheld
    What we could scarcely look upon, long used
    To such sights. I must think no more of this,
    Lest I forget in this compassion for
    Our foes, their former injuries, and lose                          370
    The hold of vengeance Loredano plans
    For him and me; but mine would be content
    With lesser retribution than he thirsts for,
    And I would mitigate his deeper hatred
    To milder thoughts; but, for the present, Foscari
    Has a short hourly respite, granted at
    The instance of the elders of the Council,
    Moved doubtless by his wife's appearance in
    The hall, and his own sufferings.--Lo! they come:
    How feeble and forlorn! I cannot bear                              380
    To look on them again in this extremity:
    I'll hence, and try to soften Loredano.[ba]
                                                        [_Exit_ BARBARIGO.




                                 ACT II.

                SCENE I.--_A hall in the_ DOGE'S _Palace_.

                       _The_ DOGE _and a Senator_.

    _Sen._ Is it your pleasure to sign the report
    Now, or postpone it till to-morrow?

    _Doge_.                            Now;
    I overlooked it yesterday: it wants
    Merely the signature. Give me the pen--
                              [_The_ DOGE _sits down and signs the paper_.
    There, Signor.

    _Sen._ (_looking at the paper_). You have forgot; it is not signed.

    _Doge_. Not signed? Ah, I perceive my eyes begin
    To wax more weak with age. I did not see
    That I had dipped the pen without effect.[bb]

    _Sen._ (_dipping the pen into the ink, and placing the paper
    before the_ DOGE). Your hand, too, shakes, my Lord: allow me, thus--

    _Doge_. 'Tis done, I thank you.

    _Sen._                          Thus the act confirmed              10
    By you and by "the Ten" gives peace to Venice.

    _Doge_. 'Tis long since she enjoyed it: may it be
    As long ere she resume her arms!

    _Sen._                          'Tis almost
    Thirty-four years of nearly ceaseless warfare
    With the Turk, or the powers of Italy;
    The state had need of some repose.

    _Doge_.                            No doubt:
    I found her Queen of Ocean, and I leave her
    Lady of Lombardy; it is a comfort[bc]
    That I have added to her diadem
    The gems of Brescia and Ravenna; Crema[50]                          20
    And Bergamo no less are hers; her realm
    By land has grown by thus much in my reign,
    While her sea-sway has not shrunk.

    _Sen._                           'Tis most true,
    And merits all our country's gratitude.

    _Doge_. Perhaps so.

    _Sen._              Which should be made manifest.

    _Doge_. I have not complained, sir.

    _Sen._                              My good Lord, forgive me.

    _Doge_. For what?

    _Sen._            My heart bleeds for you.

    _Doge_.                                  For me, Signor?

    _Sen._ And for your----

    _Doge_.                 Stop!

    _Sen._                       It must have way, my Lord:
    I have too many duties towards you
    And all your house, for past and present kindness,                  30
    Not to feel deeply for your son.

    _Doge_.                         Was this
    In your commission?

    _Sen._             What, my Lord?

    _Doge_.                          This prattle
    Of things you know not: but the treaty's signed;
    Return with it to them who sent you.

    _Sen._                              I
    Obey. I had in charge, too, from the Council,
    That you would fix an hour for their reunion.

    _Doge_. Say, when they will--now, even at this moment,
    If it so please them: I am the State's servant.

    _Sen._ They would accord some time for your repose.

    _Doge_. I have no repose, that is, none which shall cause           40
    The loss of an hour's time unto the State.
    Let them meet when they will, I shall be found
    _Where_ I should be, and _what_ I have been ever.
                           [_Exit Senator. The_ DOGE _remains in silence_.

                          _Enter an Attendant_.

    _Att._ Prince!

    _Doge_.       Say on.

    _Att._               The illustrious lady Foscari
    Requests an audience.

    _Doge_.              Bid her enter. Poor
    Marina!
               [_Exit Attendant. The_ DOGE _remains in silence as before_.

                             _Enter MARINA_.

    _Mar._      I have ventured, father, on
    Your privacy.

    _Doge_.      I have none from you, my child.
    Command my time, when not commanded by
    The State.

    _Mar._    I wished to speak to you of _him_.

    _Doge_. Your husband?                                               50

    _Mar._               And your son.

    _Doge_.                           Proceed, my daughter!

    _Mar._ I had obtained permission from "the Ten"
    To attend my husband for a limited number
    Of hours.

    _Doge_.   You had so.

    _Mar._                'Tis revoked.

    _Doge_.                             By whom?

    _Mar._ "The Ten."--When we had reached "the Bridge of Sighs,"[51]
    Which I prepared to pass with Foscari,
    The gloomy guardian of that passage first
    Demurred: a messenger was sent back to
    "The Ten;"--but as the Court no longer sate,
    And no permission had been given in writing,
    I was thrust back, with the assurance that                          60
    Until that high tribunal reassembled
    The dungeon walls must still divide us.

    _Doge_.                                True,
    The form has been omitted in the haste
    With which the court adjourned; and till it meets,
    'Tis dubious.

    _Mar._       Till it meets! and when it meets,
    They'll torture him again; and he and I
    Must purchase by renewal of the rack
    The interview of husband and of wife,
    The holiest tie beneath the Heavens!--Oh God!
    Dost thou see this?

    _Doge_.            Child--child----

    _Mar._ (_abruptly_).        Call _me_ not "child!"                  70
    You soon will have no children--you deserve none--
    You, who can talk thus calmly of a son
    In circumstances which would call forth tears
    Of blood from Spartans! Though these did not weep
    Their boys who died in battle, is it written
    That they beheld them perish piecemeal, nor
    Stretched forth a hand to save them?

    _Doge_.                             You behold me:
    I cannot weep--I would I could; but if
    Each white hair on this head were a young life,
    This ducal cap the Diadem of earth,                                 80
    This ducal ring with which I wed the waves
    A talisman to still them--I'd give all
    For him.

    _Mar._  With less he surely might be saved.

    _Doge_. That answer only shows you know not Venice.
    Alas! how should you? she knows not herself,
    In all her mystery. Hear me--they who aim
    At Foscari, aim no less at his father;
    The sire's destruction would not save the son;
    They work by different means to the same end,
    And that is--but they have not conquered yet.                       90

    _Mar._ But they have crushed.

    _Doge_.                        Nor crushed as yet--I live.

    _Mar._ And your son,--how long will he live?

    _Doge_.                                       I trust,
    For all that yet is past, as many years
    And happier than his father. The rash boy,
    With womanish impatience to return,
    Hath ruined all by that detected letter:
    A high crime, which I neither can deny
    Nor palliate, as parent or as Duke:
    Had he but borne a little, little longer
    His Candiote exile, I had hopes--he has quenched them--            100
    He must return.

    _Mar._         To exile?

    _Doge_.                 I have said it.

    _Mar._ And can I not go with him?

    _Doge_.                            You well know
    This prayer of yours was twice denied before
    By the assembled "Ten," and hardly now
    Will be accorded to a third request,
    Since aggravated errors on the part
    Of your Lord renders them still more austere.

    _Mar._ Austere? Atrocious! The old human fiends,
    With one foot in the grave, with dim eyes, strange
    To tears save drops of dotage, with long white[bd]                 110
    And scanty hairs, and shaking hands, and heads
    As palsied as their hearts are hard, they counsel,
    Cabal, and put men's lives out, as if Life
    Were no more than the feelings long extinguished
    In their accurséd bosoms.

    _Doge_.                  You know not----

    _Mar._ I do--I do--and so should you, methinks--
    That these are demons: could it be else that
    Men, who have been of women born and suckled--
    Who have loved, or talked at least of Love--have given
    Their hands in sacred vows--have danced their babes                120
    Upon their knees, perhaps have mourned above them--
    In pain, in peril, or in death--who are,
    Or were, at least in seeming, human, could
    Do as they have done by yours, and you yourself--
    _You_, who abet them?

    _Doge_.              I forgive this, for
    You know not what you say.

    _Mar._                    _You_ know it well,
    And feel it nothing.

    _Doge_.             I have borne so much,
    That words have ceased to shake me.

    _Mar._                             Oh, no doubt!
    You have seen your son's blood flow, and your flesh shook not;
    And after that, what are a woman's words?                          130
    No more than woman's tears, that they should shake you.

    _Doge_. Woman, this clamorous grief of thine, I tell thee,
    Is no more in the balance weighed with that
    Which----but I pity thee, my poor Marina!

    _Mar._ Pity my husband, or I cast it from me;
    Pity thy son! _Thou_ pity!--'tis a word
    Strange to thy heart--how came it on thy lips?

    _Doge_. I must bear these reproaches, though they wrong me.
    Couldst thou but read----

    _Mar._                   'Tis not upon thy brow,
    Nor in thine eyes, nor in thine acts,--where then                  140
    Should I behold this sympathy? or shall?

    _Doge_ (_pointing downwards_). There.

    _Mar._                               In the earth?

    _Doge_.                                 To which I am tending: when
    It lies upon this heart, far lightlier, though
    Loaded with marble, than the thoughts which press it
    Now, you will know me better.

    _Mar._                       Are you, then,
    Indeed, thus to be pitied?

    _Doge_.                   Pitied! None
    Shall ever use that base word, with which men
    Cloak their soul's hoarded triumph, as a fit one
    To mingle with my name; that name shall be,
    As far as _I_ have borne it, what it was                           150
    When I received it.

    _Mar._             But for the poor children
    Of him thou canst not, or thou wilt not save,
    You were the last to bear it.

    _Doge_.                      Would it were so!
    Better for him he never had been born;
    Better for me.--I have seen our house dishonoured.

    _Mar._ That's false! A truer, nobler, trustier heart,
    More loving, or more loyal, never beat
    Within a human breast. I would not change
    My exiled, persecuted, mangled husband,
    Oppressed but not disgraced, crushed, overwhelmed,                 160
    Alive, or dead, for Prince or Paladin
    In story or in fable, with a world
    To back his suit. Dishonoured!--_he_ dishonoured!
