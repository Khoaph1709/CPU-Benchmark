    And Sire--till late I heard the last had ceased
    To live--and unforgiving died--Oh God!

    _Josepha_. Was it for this our Ulric left us so?
    Thou dids't deceive me then--he went not forth
    To join the legions of Count Tilly's war?

    _Werner_. I know not--he had left my father's castle,              130
    Some months before his death--but why?--but why?
    Left it as I did ere his birth, perchance,
    Like me an outcast. Old age had not made
    My father meeker--and my son, Alas!
    Too much his Sire resembled----

    _Josepha_.                     Yet there's comfort.
    Restrain thy wandering Spirit--Ulric cannot
    Have left his native land--thou dost not know,
    Though it looks strangely, thy Sire and he
    In anger parted--Hope is left us still.

    _Werner_. The best hope that I ever held in youth,                 140
    When every pulse was life, each thought a joy,
    (Yet not irrationally sanguine, since
    My birth bespoke high thoughts,) hath lured and left me.
    I will not be a dreamer in mine age--
    The hunter of a shadow--let _boys hope_:
    Of Hope I now know nothing but the name--
    And that's a sound which jars upon my heart.
    I've wearied thee--Good night--my patient Love!

    _Josepha_. I must not leave thee thus--my husband--friend--
    My heart is rent in twain for thee--I scarce                       150
    Dare greet thee as I would, lest that my love
    Should seem officious and ill timed:--'tis early--
    Yet rest were as a healing balm to thee--
    Then once again--Good night!

    _Voice Without_.             What Ho--lights ho!


                                SCENE II.

    _Josepha_. What noise is that? 'tis nearer--hush! they knock.
                         [_A knocking heard at the gate_--WERNER _starts_.

    _Werner_ (_aside_). It may be that the bloodhounds of the villain,
    Who long has tracked me, have approached at last:
    I'll not be taken tamely.

    _Josepha_.                'Twas the voice,
    The single voice of some lone traveller.
    I'll to the door.

    _Werner_.         No--stay thou here--again!
                                     [_Knocking repeated. Opens the door_.
    Well--Sir--your pleasure?

                       _Enter_ CARL _the Bavarian_.

    _Carl_.                   Thanks most worthy Sir!
    My pleasure, for to-night, depends on yours--
    I'm weary, wet, and wayworn--without shelter,
    Unless you please to grant it.

    _Josepha_.                    You shall have it,                    10
    Such as this ruinous mansion may afford:
    Tis spacious, but too cold and crazy now
    For Hospitality's more cordial welcome:
    But as it is 'tis yours.

    _Werner_ (_to his wife_).   Why say ye so?
    At once such hearty greeting to a stranger?
    At such a lonely hour, too--

    _Josepha_ (_in reply to Werner_). Nay--he's honest.
    There is trust-worthiness in his blunt looks.

    _Werner_ (_to Josepha_).
    "Trustworthiness in looks!" I'll trust no looks!
    I look into men's faces for their age,
    Not for their actions--had he Adam's brow,                          20
    Open and goodly as before the fall,
    I've lived too long to trust the frankest aspect.
    (_To Carl_) Whence come you Sir?

    _Carl_.                         From Frankfort, on my way
    To my own country--I've a companion too--
    He tarries now behind:--an hour ago,
    On reaching that same river on your frontier,
    We found it swoln by storms--a stranger's carriage,
    Despite the current, drawn by sturdy mules,
    Essayed to pass, and nearly reached the middle
    Of that which was the _ford_ in gentler weather,                    30
    When down came driver, carriage, mules, and all--
    You may suppose the worthy Lord within
    Fared ill enough:--worse still he might have suffered,
    But that my comrade and myself rushed in,
    And with main strength and some good luck beside,
    Dislodged and saved him: he'll be here anon.
    His equipage by this time is at Dresden--
    I left it floating that way.

    _Werner_.                   Where is he?

    _Carl_. Hitherward on his way, even like myself--
    We saw the light and made for the nearest shelter:                  40
    You'll not deny us for a single night?
    You've room enough, methinks--and this vast ruin
    Will not be worse for three more guests.

    _Werner_.                               Two more:
    And thou?--well--be it so--(_aside_) (tonight will soon
    Be overpast: they shall not stay tomorrow)--
    Know you the name of him you saved?

    _Carl_.                             Not I!
    I think I heard him called a Baron Something--
    But was too chill to stay and hear his titles:
    You know they are sometimes tedious in the reckoning,
    If counted over by the noble wearer.                                50
    Has't any wine? I'm wet, stung to the marrow--
    My comrade waited to escort the Baron:
    They will be here, anon--they, too, want cheering:
    I'll taste for them, if it please you, courteous host!

    _Josepha_. Such as our vintage is shall give you welcome:
    I'll bring you some anon.                                 [_goes out_.

    _Carl_ (_looking round_). A goodly mansion!
    And has been nobly tenanted, I doubt not.
    This worn magnificence some day has shone
    On light hearts and long revels--those torn banners
    Have waved o'er courtly guests--and yon huge lamp                   60
    High blazed through many a midnight--I could wish
    My lot had led me here in those gay times!
    Your days, my host, must pass but heavily.
    Are you the vassal of these antient chiefs,
    Whose heir wastes elsewhere their fast melting hoards,
    And placed to keep their cobwebs company?

    _Werner_ (_who has been absorbed in thought till the latter
    part of his speech_). A Vassal!--I a vassal!--_who_ accosts me
    With such familiar question?--(_checks himself and says
    aside_)--Down startled pride!
    Have not long years of wretchedness yet quenched thee,
    And, suffering evil, wilt thou start at scorn?                      70
    (_To Carl_.) Sir! if I boast no birth--and, as you see,
    My state bespeaks none--still, no being breathes
    Who calls me slave or servant.--Like yourself
    I am a stranger here--a lonely guest--
    But, for a time, on sufferance. On my way,
    From--a far distant city--Sickness seized,
    And long detained me in the neighbouring hamlet.
    The Intendant of the owner of this castle,
    Then uninhabited, with kind intent,
    Permitted me to wait returning health                               80
    Within these walls--more sheltered than the cot
    Of humble peasants.

    _Carl_.             Worthy Sir, your mercy!
    I meant not to offend you--plain of speech,
    And blunt in apprehension, I do judge
    Men's station from their seeming--but themselves
    From acts alone. You bid me share your shelter,
    And I am bound to you; and had you been
    The lowliest vassal had not thanked you less,
    Than I do now, believing you his better,
    Perhaps my own superior--

    _Werner_.                 What imports it?                          90
    What--who I am--or whence--you are welcome--sit--
    You shall have cheer anon. (_walks disturbedly aside_)

    _Carl_ (_to himself_). Here's a strange fellow!
    Wild, churlish, angry--_why_, I know not, seek not.
    Would that the wine were come! my doublet's wet,
    But my throat dry as Summer's drought in desarts.
    Ah--here it sparkles!

       _Enter_ JOSEPHA _with wine in flask--and a cup. As she pours
         it out a Voice is heard without calling at a distance_.
             WERNER _starts_--JOSEPHA _listens tremulously_.

    _Werner_.            That voice--that voice--Hark!
    No--no--tis silent--Sir--I say--that voice--
    Whose is it--speak--

    _Carl_ (_drinking unconcernedly_).
                        Whose is it? faith, I know not--
    And, yet, 'tis my companion's: he's like you,
    And does not care to tell his name and station.                    100
                                            [_The voice again and nearer_.

    _Josepha_. 'Tis his--I knew it--Ulric!--Ulric!--Ulric!
                                     [_She drops the wine and rushes out_.

    _Carl_. The flask's unhurt--but every drop is spilt.
    Confound the voice! I say--would he were dumb!
    And faith! to me, he has been nearly so--
    A silent and unsocial travelling mate.

    _Werner_ (_stands in agitation gazing towards the door_).
    If it be he--I cannot move to meet him.
    Yes--it must be so--there is no such voice
    That so could sound and shake me: he is here,
    And I am--

                           _Enter_ STRALENHEIM.

    _Werner_ (_turns and sees him_). A curse upon thee, stranger!
    Where dids't thou learn a tone so like my boy's?                   110
    Thou mock bird of my hopes--a curse upon thee!
    Out! Out! I say. Thou shalt not harbour here.

    _Stralenheim_. What means the peasant? knows he unto whom
    He dares address this language?

    _Carl_.                         Noble Sir!
    Pray heed him not--he's Phrenzy's next door neighbour,
    And full of these strange starts and causeless jarrings.

    _Werner_. Oh, that long wished for voice!--I dreamed of it--
    And then it did elude me--then--and now.

         _Enter_ ULRIC _and_ JOSEPHA. WERNER _falls on his neck_.

    Oh God! forgive, for thou dids't not forget me.
    Although I murmured--tis--it is my Son!                            120

    _Josepha_. Aye, 'tis dear Ulric--yet, methinks, he's changed, too:
    His cheek is tanned, his frame more firmly knit!
    That scar, too, dearest Ulric--I do fear me--
    Thou hast been battling with these heretics,
    And that's a Swedish token on thy brow.

    _Ulric_. My heart is glad with yours--we meet like those
    Who never would have parted:--of the past
    You shall know more anon--but, here's a guest
    That asks a gentle welcome. Noble Baron,
    My father's silence looks discourtesy:                             130
    Yet must I plead his pardon--'tis his love
    Of a long truant that has rapt him, thus,
    From hospitable greeting--you'll be seated--
    And, Father, we will sup like famished hunters.

                         JOSEPHA _goes out here_.

    _Stralenheim_. I have much need of rest: no more refreshment!
    Were all my people housed within the hamlet,
    Or can they follow?

    _Ulric_.           Not to night I fear.
    They staid in hope the damaged Cabriole
    Might, with the dawn of day, have such repairs,
    As circumstance admits of.

    _Carl_.                    Nay--that's hopeless.                   140
    They must not only mend but draw it too.
    The mules are drowned--a murrain on them both!
    One kicked me as I would have helped him on.

    _Stralenheim_. It is most irksome to me--this delay.
    I was for Prague on business of great moment.

    _Werner_. For Prague--Sir--Say you?--

    _Stralenheim_.                        Yes, my host! for Prague.
    And these vile floods and villainous cross roads
    Steal my time from it's uses--but--my people?
    Where do they shelter?

    _Ulric_.               In the boatman's shed,
    Near to the ferry: you mistook the ford--                          150
    Tis higher to the right:--their entertainment
    Will be but rough--but 'tis a single night,
    And they had best be guardians of the baggage.
    The shed will hold the weather from their sleep,
    The woodfire warm them--and, for beds, a cloak
    Is swansdown to a seasoned traveller:
    It has been mine for many a moon, and may
    Tonight, for aught it recks me.

    _Stralenheim_.                  And tomorrow
    I must be on my journey--and betimes.
    It is not more than three days travel, hence,                      160
    To Mansfeldt Castle.

    _Werner and Ulric_. Mansfeldt Castle!--

    _Stralenheim_.                           Aye!
    For thither tends my progress--so, betimes,
    Mine host I would be stirring--think of that!
    And let me find my couch of rest at present.

    _Werner_. You shall Sir--but--to Mansfeldt!--
                          [ULRIC _stops his father and says aside to him_,
                                                 _Silence--father--_
    Whate'er it be that shakes you thus--_tread down_--
    (_To Stralenheim_) My father, Sir, was born not far from Prague,
    And knows it's environs--and, when he hears,
    The name endeared to him by native thoughts,
    He would ask of it, and it's habitants--                           170
    You will excuse his plain blunt mode of question.

    _Stralenheim_. Indeed, perchance, then, he may aid my search.
    Pray, know you aught of one named Werner? who
    (But he no doubt has passed through many names),
    Lived long in Hamburgh--and has thence been traced
    Into Silesia--and not far from hence--
    But there we lost him; he who can disclose
    Aught of him, or his hiding-place, will find
    Advantage in revealing it.

    _Ulric_.                  Why so--Sir?

    _Stralenheim_. There are strong reasons to suspect this man        180
    Of crimes against the State--league with Swedes--
    And other evil acts of moment:--he
    Who shall deliver him, bound hand and foot,
    Will benefit his country and himself:
    I will reward him doubly too.

    _Ulric_.                      You know him?

    _Stralenheim_. He never met my eyes--but Circumstance
    Has led me to near knowledge of the man.
    He is a villain--and an enemy
    To all men--most to me! If earth contain him,
    He shall be found and fettered: I have hopes,                      190
    By traces which tomorrow will unravel,
    A fresh clue to his lurking spot is nigh.

    _Carl_. And, if I find it, I will break the thread.
    What, all the world against one luckless wight!
    And he a fugitive--I would I knew him!

    _Ulric_. You'd help him to escape--is it not so?

    _Carl_. I would, indeed!

    _Ulric_.                 The greater greenhorn you!
    I would secure him--nay--I will do so.

    _Stralenheim_. If it be so--my gratitude for aid,
    And rescue of my life from the wild waters,                        200
    Will double in it's strength and it's requital.
    Your father, too, perhaps can help our search?

    _Werner_. _I_ turn a spy--no--not for _Mansfeldt Castle_,
    And all the broad domain it frowns upon.

    _Stralenheim_. Mansfeldt again!--you know it then? perchance,
    You also know the story of it's lords?

    _Werner_. Whate'er I know, there is no bribe of thine
    Can swerve me to the crooked path thou pointest.
    The chamber's ready, which your rest demands.

    _Stralenheim_ (_aside_).
    'Tis strange--this peasant's tone is wondrous high,                210
    His air imperious--and his eye shines out
    As wont to look command with a quick glance--
    His garb befits him not--why, he may be
    The man I look for! now, I look again,
    There is the very lip--short curling lip--
    And the oerjutting eye-brow dark and large,
    And the peculiar wild variety
    Of feature, even unto the Viper's eye,
    Of that detested race, and it's descendant
    Who stands alone between me and a power,                           220
    Which Princes gaze at with unquiet eyes!
    This is no peasant--but, whate'er he be,
    Tomorrow shall secure him and unfold.

    _Ulric_. It will not please you, Sir, then to remain
    With us beyond tomorrow?

    _Stralenheim_. Nay--I do not say so--there is no haste.
    And now I think again--I'll tarry here--
    Perhaps until the floods abate--we'll see--
    In the mean time--to my chamber--so--Good Night!
                                                      [_Exit with_ WERNER.

    _Werner_. This way, Sir.

    _Carl_. And I to mine: pray, where are we to rest?                 230
    We'll sup within--

    _Ulric_.          What matter where--there's room.

    _Carl_. I would fain see my way through this vast ruin;
    Come take the lamp, and we'll explore together.

    _Josepha_ (_meeting them_). And I will with my son.

    _Ulric_.                          Nay--stay--dear mother!
    These chilly damps and the cold rush of winds
    Fling a rough paleness o'er thy delicate cheek--
    And thou seem'st lovely in thy sickliness
    Of most transparent beauty:--but it grieves me.
    Nay! tarry here by the blaze of the bright hearth:--
    I will return anon--and we have much                               240
    To listen and impart. Come, Carl, we'll find
    Some gorgeous canopy, and, thence, unroost
    It's present bedfellows the bats--and thou
    Shalt slumber underneath a velvet cloud
    That mantles o'er the couch of some dead Countess.
                                                 [_Exit_ CARL _and_ ULRIC.

    _Josepha_ (_sola_). It was my joy to see him--nothing more
    I should have said--which sent my gush of blood
    Back on my full heart with a dancing tide:
    It was my weary hope's unthought fulfilment,
    My agony of mother-feelings curdled                                250
    At once in gathered rapture--which did change
    My cheek into the hue of fainting Nature.
    I should have answered thus--and yet I could not:
    For though 'twas true--it was not all the truth.
    I have much suffered in the thought of Werner's
    Late deep distemperature of mind and fortunes,
    Which since have almost driven him into phrenzy:--
    And though that I would soothe, not share, such passions,
    And show not how they shake me:--when alone,
    I feel them prey upon me by reflection,                            260
    And want the very solace I bestowed;
    And which, it seems, I cannot give and have.
    Ulric must be my comforter--his father's
    Hath long been the most melancholy soul
    That ever hovered o'er the verge of Madness:
    And, better, had he leapt into it's gulph:
    Though to the Mad thoughts are realities,
    Yet they can play with sorrow--and live on.
    But with the mind of consciousness and care
    The body wears to ruin, and the struggle,                          270
    However long, is deadly----He is lost,
    And all around him tasteless:--in his mirth
    His very laughter moves me oft to tears,
    And I have turned to hide them--for, in him,
    As Sunshine glittering o'er unburied bones----
    Soft--he is here.----

    _Werner_.             Josepha--where is Ulric?

    _Josepha_. Gone with the other stranger to gaze o'er
    These shattered corridors, and spread themselves
    A pillow with their mantles, in the least ruinous:
    I must replenish the diminished hearth                             280
    In the inner chamber--the repast is ready,
    And Ulric will be here again.--





                       THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED:

                                 A DRAMA.




               INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.


The date of the original MS. of _The Deformed Transformed_ is "Pisa,
1822." There is nothing to show in what month it was written, but it may
be conjectured that it was begun and finished within the period which
elapsed between the death of Allegra, April 20, and the death of
Shelley, July 8, 1822. According to Medwin (_Conversations_, 1824, p.
227), an unfavourable criticism of Shelley's ("It is a bad imitation of
_Faust_"), together with a discovery that "two entire lines" of
Southey's--

    "And water shall see thee,
    And fear thee, and flee thee"--

were imbedded in one of his "Songs," touched Byron so deeply that he
"threw the poem into the fire," and concealed the existence of a second
copy for more than two years. It is a fact that Byron's correspondence
does not contain the remotest allusion to _The Deformed Transformed_;
but, with regard to the plagiarism from Southey, in the play as written
in 1822 there is neither Song nor Incantation which could have contained
two lines from _The Curse of Kehama_.

As a dramatist, Byron's function, or _métier_, was twofold. In
_Manfred_, in _Cain_, in _Heaven and Earth_, he is concerned with the
analysis and evolution of metaphysical or ethical notions; in _Marino
Faliero_, in _Sardanapalus_, and _The Two Foscari_, he set himself "to
dramatize striking passages of history;" in _The Deformed Transformed_
he sought to combine the solution of a metaphysical puzzle or problem,
the relation of personality to individuality, with the scenic rendering
of a striking historical episode, the Sack of Rome in 1527.

In the note or advertisement prefixed to the drama, Byron acknowledges
that "the production" is founded partly on the story of a forgotten
novel, _The Three Brothers_, and partly on "the _Faust_ of the great
Goethe."

Arnaud, or Julian, the hero of _The Three Brothers_ (by Joshua
Pickersgill, jun., 4 vols., 1803), "sells his soul to the Devil, and
becomes an arch-fiend in order to avenge himself for the taunts of
strangers on the deformity of his person" (see _Gent. Mag._, November,
1804, vol. 74, p. 1047; and _post_, pp. 473-479). The idea of an escape
from natural bonds or disabilities by supernatural means and at the
price of the soul or will, the _un_-Christlike surrender to the tempter,
which is the _grund-stoff_ of the Faust-legend, was brought home to
Byron, in the first instance, not by Goethe, or Calderon, or Marlowe,
but by Joshua Pickersgill. A fellow-feeling lent an intimate and
peculiar interest to the theme. He had suffered all his life from a
painful and inconvenient defect, which his proud and sensitive spirit
had magnified into a deformity. He had been stung to the quick by his
mother's taunts and his sweetheart's ridicule, by the jeers of the base
and thoughtless, by slanderous and brutal paragraphs in newspapers. He
could not forget that he was lame. If his enemies had but possessed the
wit, they might have given him "the sobriquet of _Le Diable Boiteux_"
(letter to Moore, April 2, 1823, _Letters_, 1901, vi. 179). It was no
wonder that so poignant, so persistent a calamity should be "reproduced
in his poetry" (_Life_, p. 13), or that his passionate impatience of
such a "thorn in the flesh" should picture to itself a mysterious and
unhallowed miracle of healing. It is true, as Moore says (_Life_, pp.
45, 306), that "the trifling deformity of his foot" was the embittering
circumstance of his life, that it "haunted him like a curse;" but it by
no means follows that he seriously regarded his physical peculiarity as
a stamp of the Divine reprobation, that "he was possessed by an _idée
fixe_ that every blessing would be 'turned into a curse' to him" (letter
of Lady Byron to H. C. Robinson, _Diary, etc._, 1869, in. 435, 436). No
doubt he indulged himself in morbid fancies, played with the
extravagances of a restless imagination, and wedded them to verse; but
his intellect, "brooding like the day, a master o'er a slave," kept
guard. He would never have pleaded on his own behalf that the tyranny of
an _idée fixe_, a delusion that he was predestined to evil, was an
excuse for his shortcomings or his sins.

Byron's very considerable obligations to _The Three Brothers_ might have
escaped notice, but the resemblance between his "Stranger," or "Cæsar,"
and the Mephistopheles of "the great Goethe" was open and palpable.

If Medwin may be trusted (_Conversations_, 1824, p. 210), Byron had read
"_Faust_ in a sorry French translation," and it is probable that
Shelley's inspired rendering of "May-day Night," which was published in
_The Liberal_ (No. i., October 14, 1822, pp. 123-137), had been read to
him, and had attracted his attention. _The Deformed Transformed_ is "a
_Faustish_ kind of drama;" and Goethe, who maintained that Byron's play
as a whole was "no imitation," but "new and original, close, genuine,
and spirited," could not fail to perceive that "his devil was suggested
by my Mephistopheles" (_Conversations_, 1874, p. 174). The tempter who
cannot resist the temptation of sneering at his own wiles, who mocks for
mocking's sake, is not Byron's creation, but Goethe's. Lucifer talked
_at_ the clergy, if he did not "talk like a clergyman;" but the "bitter
hunchback," even when he is _solus_, sneers as the river wanders, "at
his own sweet will." He is not a doctor, but a spirit of unbelief!

The second part of _The Deformed Transformed_ represents, in three
scenes, the Siege and Sack of Rome in 1527. Byron had read Robertson's
_Charles the Fifth_ (ed. 1798, ii. 313-329) in his boyhood (_Life_, p.
47), but it is on record that he had studied, more or less closely, the
narratives of contemporary authorities. A note to _The Prophecy of
Dante_ (_Poetical Works_, 1901, iv. 258) refers to the _Sacco di Roma_,
descritto da Luigi Guicciardini, and the _Ragguaglio Storico ... sacco
di Roma dell' anno_ MDXXVII. of Jacopo Buonaparte; and it is evident
that he was familiar with Cellini's story of the marvellous gests and
exploits _quorum maxima pars fuit_, which were wrought at "the walls by
the Campo Santo," or on the ramparts of the Castle of San Angelo.

The Sack of Rome was a great national calamity, and it was something
more: it was a profanation and a sacrilege. The literature which it
evoked was a cry of anguish, a prophetic burden of despair. "Chants
populaires," writes M. Emile Gebhart (_De l'Italie_, "Le Sac de Rome en
1527," 1876, pp. 267, _sq._), "_Nouvelles_ de Giraldi Cintio, en forme
de Décaméron ... récits historiques ... de César Grollier, _Dialogues_
anonymes ... poésies de Pasquin, toute une littérature se developpa sur
ce thème douloureux.... Le _Lamento di Roma_, œuvre étrange,
d'inspiration gibeline, rappelle les espérances politiques exprimées
jadis par Dante ... 'Bien que César m'ait dépouilleé de liberté, nous
avons toujours été d'accord dans une même volonté. Je ne me lamenterais
pas si lui régnait; mais je crois qu'il est ressuscité, ou qu'il
ressuscitera véritablement, car souvent un Ange m'a annoncé qu'un César
viendrait me délivrer.'... Enfin, voici une chanson française que
répétaient en repassant les monts les soldats du Marquis de Saluces:--

    "Parlons de la déffaiete
    De ces pouvres Rommains,
    Aussi de la complainete
    De notre père saint.

    "'O noble roy de France,
    Regarde en pitié
    L'Eglise en ballance ...
    Pour Dieu! ne tarde plus,
    C'est ta mère, ta substance;
    O fils, n'en faictz reffus.'"

"Le dernier monument," adds M. Gebhart, in a footnote, "de cette
littérature, est le singulier drame de Byron, _The Deformed
Transformed_, dont Jules César est le héros, et le Sac de Rome le
cadre."

It is unlikely that Byron, who read everything he could lay his hands
upon, and spared no trouble to master his "period," had not, either at
first or second hand, acquainted himself with specimens of this popular
literature. (For _La Presa e Lamento di Roma_, _Romæ Lamentatio_, etc.,
see _Lamenti Storici dei Secoli xiv., xv_. (Medin e Fratri), _Scelta di
Curiosità_, etc., 235, 236, 237, Bologna, 1890, vol. iii. See, too, for
"Chanson sur la Mort du Connétable de Bourbon," _Recueil de Chants
historiques français_, par A. J. V. Le Roux de Lincy, 1842, ii. 99.)

_The Deformed Transformed_ was published by John Hunt, February 20,
1824. A third edition appeared February 23, 1824.

It was reviewed, unfavourably, in the _London Magazine_, March, 1824,
vol. 9, pp. 315-321; the _Scots Magazine_, March, 1824, N.S. vol. xiv.
pp. 353-356; and in the _Monthly Review_, March, 1824, Enlarged Series,
103, pp. 321, 324. One reviewer, however (_London Magazine_), had the
candour to admit that "Lord Byron may write below himself, but he can
never write below us!"

For the unfinished third part, _vide post_, pp. 532-534.

This production is founded partly on the story of a novel called "The
Three Brothers[201]," published many years ago, from which M. G. Lewis's
"Wood Demon"[202] was also taken; and partly on the "Faust" of the great
Goethe. The present publication[203] contains the two first Parts only,
and the opening chorus of the third. The rest may perhaps appear hereafter.

                 _Enter_ ARNOLD _and his mother_ BERTHA.

    _Bert._ Out, Hunchback!

    _Arn._                 I was born so, Mother![204]

    _Bert._                                       Out,
    Thou incubus! Thou nightmare! Of seven sons,
    The sole abortion!

    _Arn._              Would that I had been so,
    And never seen the light!

    _Bert._                  I would so, too!
    But as thou _hast_--hence, hence--and do thy best!
    That back of thine may bear its burthen; 'tis
    More high, if not so broad as that of others.

    _Arn._ It _bears_ its burthen;--but, my heart! Will it
    Sustain that which you lay upon it, Mother?
    I love, or, at the least, I loved you: nothing                      10
    Save You, in nature, can love aught like me.
    You nursed me--do not kill me!

    _Bert._                      Yes--I nursed thee,
    Because thou wert my first-born, and I knew not
    If there would be another unlike thee,
    That monstrous sport of Nature. But get hence,
    And gather wood![205]

    _Arn._           I will: but when I bring it,
    Speak to me kindly. Though my brothers are
    So beautiful and lusty, and as free
    As the free chase they follow, do not spurn me:
    Our milk has been the same.

    _Bert._                    As is the hedgehog's,                    20
    Which sucks at midnight from the wholesome dam
    Of the young bull, until the milkmaid finds
    The nipple, next day, sore, and udder dry.
    Call not thy brothers brethren! Call me not
    Mother; for if I brought thee forth, it was
    As foolish hens at times hatch vipers, by
    Sitting upon strange eggs. Out, urchin, out!
                                                           [_Exit_ BERTHA.

    _Arn._ (_solus_). Oh, mother!--She is gone, and I must do
    Her bidding;--wearily but willingly
    I would fulfil it, could I only hope                                30
    A kind word in return. What shall I do?

                                [_ARNOLD begins to cut wood: in doing this
                                     he wounds one of his hands_.

    My labour for the day is over now.
    Accursed be this blood that flows so fast;
    For double curses will be my meed now
    At home--What home? I have no home, no kin,
    No kind--not made like other creatures, or
    To share their sports or pleasures. Must I bleed, too,
    Like them? Oh, that each drop which falls to earth
    Would rise a snake to sting them, as they have stung me!
    Or that the Devil, to whom they liken me,                           40
    Would aid his likeness! If I must partake[206]
    His form, why not his power? Is it because
    I have not his will too? For one kind word
    From her who bore me would still reconcile me
    Even to this hateful aspect. Let me wash
    The wound.

                             [ARNOLD _goes to a spring, and stoops to wash
                                     his hand: he starts back_.

    They are right; and Nature's mirror shows me,
    What she hath made me. I will not look on it
    Again, and scarce dare think on't. Hideous wretch
    That I am! The very waters mock me with                             50
    My horrid shadow--like a demon placed
    Deep in the fountain to scare back the cattle
    From drinking therein.                                   [_He pauses_.
                           And shall I live on,
    A burden to the earth, myself, and shame
    Unto what brought me into life? Thou blood,
    Which flowest so freely from a scratch, let me
    Try if thou wilt not, in a fuller stream,
    Pour forth my woes for ever with thyself
    On earth, to which I will restore, at once,
    This hateful compound of her atoms, and                             60
    Resolve back to her elements, and take
    The shape of any reptile save myself,
    And make a world for myriads of new worms!
    This knife! now let me prove if it will sever
    This withered slip of Nature's nightshade--my
    Vile form--from the creation, as it hath
    The green bough from the forest.

                             [ARNOLD _places the knife in the ground, with
                                    the point upwards_.

                                    Now 'tis set,
    And I can fall upon it. Yet one glance
    On the fair day, which sees no foul thing like
    Myself, and the sweet sun which warmed me, but                      70
    In vain. The birds--how joyously they sing!
    So let them, for I would not be lamented:
    But let their merriest notes be Arnold's knell;
    The fallen leaves my monument; the murmur
    Of the near fountain my sole elegy.
    Now, knife, stand firmly, as I fain would fall!

                           [_As he rushes to throw himself upon the knife,
                               his eye is suddenly caught by the fountain,
                               which seems in motion_.

    The fountain moves without a wind: but shall
    The ripple of a spring change my resolve?
    No. Yet it moves again! The waters stir,
    Not as with air, but by some subterrane                             80
    And rocking Power of the internal world.
    What's here? A mist! No more?--

                       [_A cloud comes from the fountain. He stands gazing
                             upon it: it is dispelled, and a tall black
                             man comes towards him_.[207]

    _Arn._                           What would you? Speak!
    Spirit or man?

    _Stran._       As man is both, why not
    Say both in one?

    _Arn._          Your form is man's, and yet
    You may be devil.

    _Stran._         So many men are that
    Which is so called or thought, that you may add me
    To which you please, without much wrong to either.
    But come: you wish to kill yourself;--pursue
    Your purpose.

    _Arn._       You have interrupted me.

    _Stran._ What is that resolution which can e'er                     90
    Be interrupted? If I be the devil
    You deem, a single moment would have made you
    Mine, and for ever, by your suicide;
    And yet my coming saves you.

    _Arn._                       I said not
    You _were_ the Demon, but that your approach
    Was like one.

    _Stran._      Unless you keep company
    With him (and you seem scarce used to such high
    Society) you can't tell how he approaches;
    And for his aspect, look upon the fountain,
    And then on me, and judge which of us twain                        100
    Looks likest what the boors believe to be
    Their cloven-footed terror.

    _Arn._                      Do you--dare _you_
    To taunt me with my born deformity?

    _Stran._ Were I to taunt a buffalo with this
    Cloven foot of thine, or the swift dromedary
    With thy Sublime of Humps, the animals
    Would revel in the compliment. And yet
    Both beings are more swift, more strong, more mighty
    In action and endurance than thyself,
    And all the fierce and fair of the same kind                       110
    With thee. Thy form is natural: 'twas only
    Nature's mistaken largess to bestow
    The gifts which are of others upon man.

    _Arn._ Give me the strength then of the buffalo's foot,[cw]
    When he spurns high the dust, beholding his
    Near enemy; or let me have the long
    And patient swiftness of the desert-ship,
    The helmless dromedary!--and I'll bear[cx]
    Thy fiendish sarcasm with a saintly patience.

    _Stran._ I will.

    _Arn._ (_with surprise_). Thou _canst?_

    _Stran._                          Perhaps. Would you aught else?   120

    _Arn._ Thou mockest me.

    _Stran._                Not I. Why should I mock
    What all are mocking? That's poor sport, methinks.
    To talk to thee in human language (for
    Thou canst not yet speak mine), the forester
    Hunts not the wretched coney, but the boar,
    Or wolf, or lion--leaving paltry game
    To petty burghers, who leave once a year
    Their walls, to fill their household cauldrons with
    Such scullion prey. The meanest gibe at thee,--
    Now _I_ can mock the mightiest.[cy]

    _Arn._                           Then waste not                    130
    Thy time on me: I seek thee not.

    _Stran._                         Your thoughts
    Are not far from me. Do not send me back:
    I'm not so easily recalled to do
    Good service.

    _Arn._        What wilt thou do for me?

    _Stran._                               Change
    Shapes with you, if you will, since yours so irks you;
    Or form you to your wish in any shape.

    _Arn._ Oh! then you are indeed the Demon, for
    Nought else would wittingly wear mine.

    _Stran._                               I'll show thee
    The brightest which the world e'er bore, and give thee
    Thy choice.

    _Arn._       On what condition?

    _Stran._                       There's a question!                 140
    An hour ago you would have given your soul
    To look like other men, and now you pause
    To wear the form of heroes.

    _Arn._                     No; I will not.
    I must not compromise my soul.

    _Stran._                       What soul,
    Worth naming so, would dwell in such a carcase?

    _Arn._ 'Tis an aspiring one, whate'er the tenement
    In which it is mislodged. But name your compact:
    Must it be signed in blood?

    _Stran._                   Not in your own.

    _Arn._ Whose blood then?

    _Stran._                 We will talk of that hereafter.
    But I'll be moderate with you, for I see                           150
    Great things within you. You shall have no bond
    But your own will, no contract save your deeds.
    Are you content?

    _Arn._           I take thee at thy word.

    _Stran._   Now then!--
             [_The Stranger approaches the fountain, and turns to_ ARNOLD.

                          A little of your blood.[208]

    _Arn._                                        For what?

    _Stran._ To mingle with the magic of the waters,
    And make the charm effective.

    _Arn._ (_holding out his wounded arm_). Take it all.

    _Stran._ Not now. A few drops will suffice for this.

                      [_The Stranger takes some of_ ARNOLD'S _blood in his
                             hand, and casts it into the fountain_.

      Bestrides the Hartz Mountain.[209]
    Come as ye were,
      That our eyes may behold
    The model in air
      Of the form I will mould,
    Bright as the Iris                                                 170
      When ether is spanned;--
    Such _his_ desire is,                           [_Pointing to_ ARNOLD.
      Such _my_ command![da]
    Demons heroic--
      Demons who wore
    The form of the Stoic
      Or sophist of yore--
    Or the shape of each victor--
      From Macedon's boy,
    To each high Roman's picture,                                      180
      Who breathed to destroy--
    Shadows of Beauty!
      Shadows of Power!
    Up to your duty--
      This is the hour!

                        [_Various phantoms arise from the waters, and pass
                            in succession before the Stranger and_ ARNOLD.

    _Arn._ What do I see?

    _Stran._              The black-eyed Roman,[210] with
    The eagle's beak between those eyes which ne'er
    Beheld a conqueror, or looked along
    The land he made not Rome's, while Rome became
    His, and all theirs who heired his very name.                      190

    _Arn._ The phantom's bald; _my_ quest is beauty. Could I
    Inherit but his fame with his defects!

    _Stran._ His brow was girt with laurels more than hairs.[211]
    You see his aspect--choose it, or reject.
    I can but promise you his form; his fame
    Must be long sought and fought for.

    _Arn._                              I will fight, too,
    But not as a mock Cæsar. Let him pass:
    His aspect may be fair, but suits me not.

    _Stran._ Then you are far more difficult to please
    Than Cato's sister, or than Brutus's mother,                       200
    Or Cleopatra at sixteen[212]--an age
    When love is not less in the eye than heart.
    But be it so! Shadow, pass on!
                                [_The phantom of Julius Cæsar disappears_.

    _Arn._                          And can it
    Be, that the man who shook the earth is gone,[db]
    And left no footstep?

    _Stran._             There you err. His substance
    Left graves enough, and woes enough, and fame
    More than enough to track his memory;
    But for his shadow--'tis no more than yours,
    Except a little longer and less crooked
    I' the sun. Behold another!                [_A second phantom passes_.

    _Arn._                     Who is he?                              210

    _Stran._ He was the fairest and the bravest of
    Athenians.[213] Look upon him well.

    _Arn._                             He is
    More lovely than the last. How beautiful!

    _Stran._ Such was the curled son of Clinias;--wouldst thou
    Invest thee with his form?

    _Arn._                     Would that I had
    Been born with it! But since I may choose further,
    I will _look_ further.          [_The shade of Alcibiades disappears_.

    _Stran._              Lo! behold again!

    _Arn._ What! that low, swarthy, short-nosed, round-eyed satyr,
    With the wide nostrils and Silenus' aspect,
    The splay feet and low stature![214] I had better                  220
    Remain that which I am.

    _Stran._               And yet he was
    The earth's perfection of all mental beauty,
    And personification of all virtue.
    But you reject him?

    _Arn._             If his form could bring me
    That which redeemed it--no.

    _Stran._                     I have no power
    To promise that; but you may try, and find it
    Easier in such a form--or in your own.

    _Arn._ No. I was not born for philosophy,
    Though I have that about me which has need on't.
    Let him fleet on.

    _Stran._          Be air, thou Hemlock-drinker!                    230
                      [_The shadow of Socrates disappears: another rises_.

    _Arn._ What's here? whose broad brow and whose curly beard
    And manly aspect look like Hercules,[215]
    Save that his jocund eye hath more of Bacchus
    Than the sad purger of the infernal world,
    Leaning dejected on his club of conquest,[216]
    As if he knew the worthlessness of those
    For whom he had fought.

    _Stran._                It was the man who lost
    The ancient world for love.

    _Arn._                      I cannot blame him,
    Since I have risked my soul because I find not
    That which he exchanged the earth for.

    _Stran._                              Since so far                 240
    You seem congenial, will you wear his features?

    _Arn._ No. As you leave me choice, I am difficult.
    If but to see the heroes I should ne'er
    Have seen else, on this side of the dim shore,
    Whence they float back before us.

    _Stran._                         Hence, Triumvir,
    Thy Cleopatra's waiting.
                         [_The shade of Antony disappears: another rises_.

    _Arn._                  Who is this?
    Who truly looketh like a demigod,
    Blooming and bright, with golden hair, and stature,
    If not more high than mortal, yet immortal
    In all that nameless bearing of his limbs,                         250
    Which he wears as the Sun his rays--a something
    Which shines from him, and yet is but the flashing
    Emanation of a thing more glorious still.
    Was _he e'er human only?_[217]

    _Stran._                   Let the earth speak,
    If there be atoms of him left, or even
    Of the more solid gold that formed his urn.

    _Arn._ Who was this glory of mankind?

    _Stran._                              The shame
    Of Greece in peace, her thunderbolt in war--
    Demetrius the Macedonian, and
    Taker of cities.

    _Arn._           Yet one shadow more.                              260

    _Stran._ (_addressing the shadow_). Get thee to Lamia's lap!
            [_The shade of Demetrius Poliorcetes vanishes: another rises_.
                                      I'll fit you still,
    Fear not, my Hunchback: if the shadows of
    That which existed please not your nice taste,
    I'll animate the ideal marble, till
    Your soul be reconciled to her new garment

    _Arn._ Content! I will fix here.

    _Stran._                         I must commend
    Your choice. The godlike son of the sea-goddess,
    The unshorn boy of Peleus, with his locks
    As beautiful and clear as the amber waves
    Of rich Pactolus, rolled o'er sands of gold,                       270
    Softened by intervening crystal, and
    Rippled like flowing waters by the wind,
    All vowed to Sperchius[218] as they were--behold them!
    And _him_--as he stood by Polixena,
    With sanctioned and with softened love, before
    The altar, gazing on his Trojan bride,
    With some remorse within for Hector slain
    And Priam weeping, mingled with deep passion
    For the sweet downcast virgin, whose young hand
    Trembled in _his_ who slew her brother. So                         280
    He stood i' the temple! Look upon him as
    Greece looked her last upon her best, the instant
    Ere Paris' arrow flew.

    _Arn._                I gaze upon him
    As if I were his soul, whose form shall soon
    Envelope mine.

    _Stran._       You have done well. The greatest
    Deformity should only barter with
    The extremest beauty--if the proverb's true
    Of mortals, that Extremes meet.

    _Arn._                          Come! Be quick!
    I am impatient.

    _Stran._        As a youthful beauty
    Before her glass. _You both_ see what is not,                      290
    But dream it is what must be.

    _Arn._                        Must I wait?

    _Stran._ No; that were a pity. But a word or two:
    His stature is twelve cubits; would you so far
    Outstep these times, and be a Titan? Or
    (To talk canonically) wax a son
    Of Anak?

    _Arn._ Why not?

    _Stran._        Glorious ambition!
    I love thee most in dwarfs! A mortal of
    Philistine stature would have gladly pared
    His own Goliath down to a slight David:
    But thou, my manikin, wouldst soar a show                          300
    Rather than hero. Thou shalt be indulged,
    If such be thy desire; and, yet, by being
    A little less removed from present men
    In figure, thou canst sway them more; for all
    Would rise against thee now, as if to hunt
    A new-found Mammoth; and their curséd engines,
    Their culverins, and so forth, would find way
    Through our friend's armour there, with greater ease
    Than the Adulterer's arrow through his heel
    Which Thetis had forgotten to baptize                              310
    In Styx.

    _Arn._  Then let it be as thou deem'st best.

    _Stran._ Thou shalt be beauteous as the thing thou seest,
    And strong as what it was, and----

    _Arn._                          I ask not
    For Valour, since Deformity is daring.[219]
    It is its essence to o'ertake mankind
    By heart and soul, and make itself the equal--
    Aye, the superior of the rest. There is
    A spur in its halt movements, to become
    All that the others cannot, in such things
    As still are free to both, to compensate                           320
    For stepdame Nature's avarice at first.
    They woo with fearless deeds the smiles of fortune,
    And oft, like Timour the lame Tartar,[220] win them.

    _Stran._ Well spoken! And thou doubtless wilt remain
    Formed as thou art. I may dismiss the mould
    Of shadow, which must turn to flesh, to incase
    This daring soul, which could achieve no less
    Without it.

    _Arn._      Had no power presented me
    The possibility of change, I would
    Have done the best which spirit may to make                        330
    Its way with all Deformity's dull, deadly,
    Discouraging weight upon me, like a mountain,
    In feeling, on my heart as on my shoulders--
    A hateful and unsightly molehill to
    The eyes of happier men. I would have looked
    On Beauty in that sex which is the type
    Of all we know or dream of beautiful,
    Beyond the world they brighten, with a sigh--
    Not of love, but despair; nor sought to win,
    Though to a heart all love, what could not love me                 340
    In turn, because of this vile crookéd clog,
    Which makes me lonely. Nay, I could have borne
    It all, had not my mother spurned me from her.
    The she-bear licks her cubs into a sort
    Of shape;--my Dam beheld my shape was hopeless.
    Had she exposed me, like the Spartan, ere
    I knew the passionate part of life, I had
    Been a clod of the valley,--happier nothing
    Than what I am. But even thus--the lowest,
    Ugliest, and meanest of mankind--what courage                      350
    And perseverance could have done, perchance
    Had made me something--as it has made heroes
    Of the same mould as mine. You lately saw me
    Master of my own life, and quick to quit it;
    And he who is so is the master of
    Whatever dreads to die.

    _Stran._               Decide between
    What you have been, or will be.

    _Arn._                         I have done so.
    You have opened brighter prospects to my eyes,
    And sweeter to my heart. As I am now,
    I might be feared--admired--respected--loved                       360
    Of all save those next to me, of whom I
    Would be belovéd. As thou showest me
    A choice of forms, I take the one I view.
    Haste! haste!

    _Stran._      And what shall _I_ wear?

    _Arn._                                 Surely, he
    Who can command all forms will choose the highest,
    Something superior even to that which was
    Pelides now before us. Perhaps _his_
    Who slew him, that of Paris: or--still higher--
    The Poet's God, clothed in such limbs as are
    Themselves a poetry.

    _Stran._            Less will content me;                          370
    For I, too, love a change.

    _Arn._                    Your aspect is
    Dusky, but not uncomely.[221]

    _Stran._                  If I chose,
    I might be whiter; but I have a _penchant_
    For black--it is so honest, and, besides,
    Can neither blush with shame nor pale with fear;
    But I have worn it long enough of late,
    And now I'll take your figure.

    _Arn._                         Mine!

    _Stran._                            Yes. You
    Shall change with Thetis' son, and I with Bertha,
    Your mother's offspring. People have their tastes;
    You have yours--I mine.

    _Arn._                  Despatch! despatch!

    _Stran._                                  Even so.                 380

                             [_The Stranger takes some earth and moulds it
                                  along the turf, and then addresses
                                  the phantom of Achilles_.

    Beautiful shadow
      Of Thetis's boy!
    Who sleeps in the meadow
      Whose grass grows o'er Troy:
    From the red earth, like Adam,[222]
      Thy likeness I shape,
    As the Being who made him,
      Whose actions I ape.
    Thou Clay, be all glowing,
      Till the Rose in his cheek                                       390
    Be as fair as, when blowing,
      It wears its first streak!
    Ye Violets, I scatter,
      Now turn into eyes!
    And thou, sunshiny Water,
      Of blood take the guise!
    Let these Hyacinth boughs
      Be his long flowing hair,
    And wave o'er his brows,
      As thou wavest in air!                                           400
    Let his heart be this marble
      I tear from the rock!
    But his voice as the warble
      Of birds on yon oak!
    Let his flesh be the purest
      Of mould, in which grew
    The Lily-root surest,
      And drank the best dew!
    Let his limbs be the lightest
      Which clay can compound,                                         410
    And his aspect the brightest
      On earth to be found!
    Elements, near me,
      Be mingled and stirred,
    Know me, and hear me,
      And leap to my word!
    Sunbeams, awaken
      This earth's animation![dc]
    'Tis done! He hath taken
      His stand in creation!                                           420

                  [ARNOLD _falls senseless; his soul passes into the shape
                         of Achilles, which rises from the ground; while
                         the phantom has disappeared, part by part,
                         as the figure was formed from the earth_.

    _Arn._ (_in his new form_). I love, and I shall be beloved! Oh, life!
    At last I feel thee! Glorious Spirit!

    _Stran._                             Stop!
    What shall become of your abandoned garment,
    Yon hump, and lump, and clod of ugliness,
    Which late you wore, or were?

    _Arn._                       Who cares? Let wolves
    And vultures take it, if they will.

    _Stran._                            And if
    They do, and are not scared by it, you'll say
    It must be peace-time, and no better fare
    Abroad i' the fields.

    _Arn._               Let us but leave it there;
    No matter what becomes on't.

    _Stran._                    That's ungracious;                     430
    If not ungrateful. Whatsoe'er it be,
    It hath sustained your soul full many a day.

    _Arn._ Aye, as the dunghill may conceal a gem
    Which is now set in gold, as jewels should be.

    _Stran._ But if I give another form, it must be
    By fair exchange, not robbery. For they[223]
    Who make men without women's aid have long
    Had patents for the same, and do not love
    Your Interlopers. The Devil may take men,[dd]
    Not make them,--though he reap the benefit                         440
    Of the original workmanship:--and therefore
    Some one must be found to assume the shape
    You have quitted.

    _Arn._            Who would do so?

    _Stran._                         That I know not,
    And therefore I must.

    _Arn._                You!

    _Stran._                  I said it ere
    You inhabited your present dome of beauty.

    _Arn._ True. I forget all things in the new joy
    Of this immortal change.

    _Stran._                In a few moments
    I will be as you were, and you shall see
    Yourself for ever by you, as your shadow.

    _Arn._ I would be spared this.

    _Stran._                       But it cannot be.                   450
    What! shrink already, being what you are,
    From seeing what you were?

    _Arn._                    Do as thou wilt.

    _Stran._ (_to the late form of_ ARNOLD, _extended on the earth_).
          Clay! not dead, but soul-less!
            Though no man would choose thee,
          An Immortal no less
            Deigns not to refuse thee.
          Clay thou art; and unto spirit
          All clay is of equal merit.
          Fire! _without_ which nought can live;
          Fire! but _in_ which nought can live,                        460
            Save the fabled salamander,
            Or immortal souls, which wander,
          Praying what doth not forgive,
          Howling for a drop of water,
              Burning in a quenchless lot:
          Fire! the only element
            Where nor fish, beast, bird, nor worm,
              Save the Worm which dieth not,
            Can preserve a moment's form,
          But must with thyself be blent:                              470
          Fire! man's safeguard and his slaughter:
          Fire! Creation's first-born Daughter,
            And Destruction's threatened Son,
            When Heaven with the world hath done:
          Fire! assist me to renew
          Life in what lies in my view
            Stiff and cold!
          His resurrection rests with me and you!
          One little, marshy spark of flame--[224]
          And he again shall seem the same;                            480
            But I his Spirit's place shall hold!

                        [_An ignis-fatuus flits through the wood and rests
                             on the brow of the body. The Stranger
                             disappears: the body rises_.

    _Arn._ (_in his new form_). Oh! horrible!

    _Stran._ (_in_ ARNOLD'S _late shape_). What! tremblest thou?

    _Arn._                                   Not so--
    I merely shudder. Where is fled the shape
    Thou lately worest?

    _Stran._           To the world of shadows.
    But let us thread the present. Whither wilt thou?

    _Arn._ Must thou be my companion?

    _Stran._                          Wherefore not?
    Your betters keep worse company.

    _Arn._                          _My_ betters!

    _Stran._ Oh! you wax proud, I see, of your new form:
    I'm glad of that. Ungrateful too! That's well;
    You improve apace;--two changes in an instant,                     490
    And you are old in the World's ways already.
    But bear with me: indeed you'll find me useful
    Upon your pilgrimage. But come, pronounce
    Where shall we now be errant?

    _Arn._                       Where the World
    Is thickest, that I may behold it in
    Its workings.

    _Stran._     That's to say, where there is War
    And Woman in activity. Let's see!
    Spain--Italy--the new Atlantic world[225]--
    Afric with all its Moors. In very truth,
    There is small choice: the whole race are just now                 500
    Tugging as usual at each other's hearts.

    _Arn._ I have heard great things of Rome.

    _Stran._                                  A goodly choice--
    And scarce a better to be found on earth,
    Since Sodom was put out. The field is wide too;
    For now the Frank, and Hun, and Spanish scion
    Of the old Vandals, are at play along
    The sunny shores of the World's garden.

    _Arn._                                 How
    Shall we proceed?

    _Stran._         Like gallants, on good coursers.
    What, ho! my chargers! Never yet were better,
    Since Phaeton was upset into the Po[226].                          510
    Our pages too!

             _Enter two Pages, with four coal-black horses_.

    _Arn._          A noble sight!

    _Stran._                      And of
    A nobler breed. Match me in Barbary,
    Or your Kochlini race of Araby[de][227],
    With these!

    _Arn._     The mighty steam, which volumes high
    From their proud nostrils, burns the very air;
    And sparks of flame, like dancing fire-flies wheel
    Around their manes, as common insects swarm
    Round common steeds towards sunset.

    _Stran._                           Mount, my lord:
    They and I are your servitors.

    _Arn._                        And these
    Our dark-eyed pages--what may be their names?                      520

    _Stran._ You shall baptize them.

    _Arn._                           What! in holy water?

    _Stran._ Why not? The deeper sinner, better saint.

    _Arn._ They are beautiful, and cannot, sure, be demons.

    _Stran._ True; the devil's always ugly: and your beauty
    Is never diabolical.

    _Arn._               I'll call him
    Who bears the golden horn, and wears such bright
    And blooming aspect, _Huon_;[228] for he looks
    Like to the lovely boy lost in the forest,
    And never found till now. And for the other
    And darker, and more thoughtful, who smiles not,                   530
    But looks as serious though serene as night,
    He shall be _Memnon_[229], from the Ethiop king
    Whose statue turns a harper once a day.
    And you?

    _Stran._ I have ten thousand names, and twice
    As many attributes; but as I wear
    A human shape, will take a human name.

    _Arn._ More human than the shape (though it was mine once)
    I trust.

    _Stran._ Then call me Cæsar.

    _Arn._                       Why, that name
    Belongs to Empire, and has been but borne
    By the World's lords.

    _Stran._             And therefore fittest for                     540
    The Devil in disguise--since so you deem me,
    Unless you call me Pope instead.

    _Arn._                           Well, then,
    Cæsar thou shalt be. For myself, my name
    Shall be plain Arnold still.

    _Cæs._                      We'll add a title[df]--
    "Count Arnold:" it hath no ungracious sound,
    And will look well upon a billet-doux.

    _Arn._ Or in an order for a battle-field.

    _Cæs._ (_sings_).
        To horse! to horse! my coal-black steed
          Paws the ground and snuffs the air!
        There's not a foal of Arab's breed                             550
          More knows whom he must bear;
          On the hill he will not tire,
          Swifter as it waxes higher;
          In the marsh he will not slacken,
          On the plain be overtaken;
          In the wave he will not sink,
          Nor pause at the brook's side to drink;
          In the race he will not pant,
          In the combat he'll not faint;
          On the stones he will not stumble,                           560
          Time nor toil shall make him humble;
          In the stall he will not stiffen,
          But be wingèd as a Griffin,
          Only flying with his feet:
          And will not such a voyage be sweet?
          Merrily! merrily! never unsound,
          Shall our bonny black horses skim over the ground!
        From the Alps to the Caucasus, ride we, or fly!
        For we'll leave them behind in the glance of an eye.
                                [_They mount their horses, and disappear_.


              SCENE II.--_A Camp before the walls of Rome_.

                           ARNOLD _and_ CÆSAR.

    _Cæs._ You are well entered now.

    _Arn._                           Aye; but my path
    Has been o'er carcasses: mine eyes are full[dg]
    Of blood.

    _Cæs._    Then wipe them, and see clearly. Why!
    Thou art a conqueror; the chosen knight
    And free companion of the gallant Bourbon,
    Late constable of France[230]; and now to be
    Lord of the city which hath been Earth's Lord
    Under its emperors, and--changing sex,
    Not sceptre, an Hermaphrodite of Empire--
    _Lady_ of the old world[231].

    _Arn._                       How _old?_ What! are there             10
    _New_ worlds?

    _Cæs._       To _you_. You'll find there are such shortly,
    By its rich harvests, new disease, and gold;
    From one _half_ of the world named a _whole_ new one,
    Because you know no better than the dull
    And dubious notice of your eyes and ears.

    _Arn._ I'll trust them.

    _Cæs._                  Do! They will deceive you sweetly,
    And that is better than the bitter truth.

    _Arn._ Dog!

    _Cæs._       Man!

    _Arn._            Devil!

    _Cæs._                  Your obedient humble servant.

    _Arn._ Say _master_ rather. Thou hast lured me on,
    Through scenes of blood and lust, till I am here.                   20

    _Cæs._ And where wouldst thou be?

    _Arn._                           Oh, _at_ peace--_in_ peace!

    _Cæs._ And where is that which is so? From the star
    To the winding worm, all life is motion; and
    In life _commotion_ is the extremest point
    Of life. The planet wheels till it becomes
    A comet, and destroying as it sweeps
    The stars, goes out. The poor worm winds its way,
    Living upon the death of other things,
    But still, like them, must live and die, the subject
    Of something which has made it live and die.                        30
    You must obey what all obey, the rule
    Of fixed Necessity: against her edict
    Rebellion prospers not.

    _Arn._                  And when it prospers----

    _Cæs._ 'Tis no rebellion.

    _Arn._                     Will it prosper now?

    _Cæs._ The Bourbon hath given orders for the assault,
    And by the dawn there will be work.

    _Arn._                              Alas!
    And shall the city yield? I see the giant
    Abode of the true God, and his true saint,
    Saint Peter, rear its dome and cross into
    That sky whence Christ ascended from the cross,                     40
    Which his blood made a badge of glory and
    Of joy (as once of torture unto him),--
    God and God's Son, man's sole and only refuge!

    _Cæs._ 'Tis there, and shall be.

    _Arn._                            What?

    _Cæs._                                The Crucifix
    Above, and many altar shrines below.
    Also some culverins upon the walls,
    And harquebusses, and what not; besides
    The men who are to kindle them to death
    Of other men.

    _Arn._        And those scarce mortal arches,[232]
    Pile above pile of everlasting wall,                                50
    The theatre where Emperors and their subjects
    (Those subjects _Romans_) stood at gaze upon
    The battles of the monarchs of the wild
    And wood--the lion and his tusky rebels
    Of the then untamed desert, brought to joust
    In the arena--as right well they might,
    When they had left no human foe unconquered--
    Made even the forest pay its tribute of
    Life to their amphitheatre, as well
    As Dacia men to die the eternal death                               60
    For a sole instant's pastime, and "Pass on
    To a new gladiator!"--Must it fall?

    _Cæs._ The city, or the amphitheatre?
    The church, or one, or all? for you confound
    Both them and me.

    _Arn._            To-morrow sounds the assault
    With the first cock-crow.

    _Cæs._                   Which, if it end with
    The evening's first nightingale, will be
    Something new in the annals of great sieges;
    For men must have their prey after long toil.

    _Arn._ The sun goes down as calmly, and perhaps                     70
    More beautifully, than he did on Rome
    On the day Remus leapt her wall.

    _Cæs._                          I saw him.

    _Arn._ You!

    _Cæs._      Yes, Sir! You forget I am or was
    Spirit, till I took up with your cast shape,
    And a worse name. I'm Cæsar and a hunch-back
    Now. Well! the first of Cæsars was a bald-head,
    And loved his laurels better as a wig
    (So history says) than as a glory.[233] Thus
    The world runs on, but we'll be merry still.
    I saw your Romulus (simple as I am)                                 80
    Slay his own twin, quick-born of the same womb,
    Because he leapt a ditch ('twas then no wall,
    Whate'er it now be); and Rome's earliest cement
    Was brother's blood; and if its native blood
    Be spilt till the choked Tiber be as red
    As e'er 'twas yellow, it will never wear
    The deep hue of the Ocean and the Earth,
    Which the great robber sons of fratricide
    Have made their never-ceasing scene of slaughter,
    For ages.

    _Arn._    But what have these done, their far                       90
    Remote descendants, who have lived in peace,
    The peace of Heaven, and in her sunshine of
    Piety?

    _Cæs._ And what had _they_ done, whom the old
    Romans o'erswept?--Hark!

    _Arn._                   They are soldiers singing
    A reckless roundelay, upon the eve
    Of many deaths, it may be of their own.

    _Cæs._ And why should they not sing as well as swans?
    They are black ones, to be sure.

    _Arn._                          So, you are learned,
    I see, too?

    _Cæs._     In my grammar, certes. I
    Was educated for a monk of all times,                              100
    And once I was well versed in the forgotten
    Etruscan letters, and--were I so minded--
    Could make their hieroglyphics plainer than
    Your alphabet.

    _Arn._         And wherefore do you not?

    _Cæs._ It answers better to resolve the alphabet
    Back into hieroglyphics. Like your statesman,
    And prophet, pontiff, doctor, alchymist,
    Philosopher, and what not, they have built
    More Babels, without new dispersion, than
    The stammering young ones of the flood's dull ooze,                110
    Who failed and fled each other. Why? why, marry,
    Because no man could understand his neighbour.
    They are wiser now, and will not separate
    For nonsense. Nay, it is their brotherhood,
    Their Shibboleth--their Koran--Talmud--their
    Cabala--their best brick-work, wherewithal
    They build more----

    _Arn._ (_interrupting him_). Oh, thou everlasting sneerer!
    Be silent! How the soldier's rough strain seems
    Softened by distance to a hymn-like cadence!
    Listen!

    _Cæs._ Yes. I have heard the angels sing.                          120

    _Arn._ And demons howl.

    _Cæs._                 And man, too. Let us listen:
    I love all music.

                     _Song of the Soldiers within_.

                The black bands came over
                  The Alps and their snow;
                With Bourbon, the rover,
                  They passed the broad Po.
                We have beaten all foemen,
                  We have captured a King[234],
                We have turned back on no men,
                  And so let us sing!                                  130
                Here's the Bourbon for ever!
                  Though penniless all,
                We'll have one more endeavour
                  At yonder old wall.
                With the Bourbon we'll gather
                  At day-dawn before
                The gates, and together
                  Or break or climb o'er
                The wall: on the ladder,
                  As mounts each firm foot[dh],                        140
                Our shout shall grow gladder,
                  And Death only be mute[235].
                With the Bourbon we'll mount o'er
                  The walls of old Rome,
                And who then shall count o'er[di]
                  The spoils of each dome?
                Up! up with the Lily!
                  And down with the Keys!
                In old Rome, the seven-hilly,
                  We'll revel at ease.                                 150
                Her streets shall be gory,
                  Her Tiber all red,
                And her temples so hoary
                  Shall clang with our tread.
                Oh, the Bourbon! the Bourbon[236]!
                  The Bourbon for aye!
                Of our song bear the burden!
                  And fire, fire away!
                With Spain for the vanguard,
                  Our varied host comes;                               160
                And next to the Spaniard
                  Beat Germany's drums;
                And Italy's lances
                  Are couched at their mother;
                But our leader from France is,
                  Who warred with his brother.
                Oh, the Bourbon! the Bourbon!
                  Sans country or home,
                We'll follow the Bourbon,
                  To plunder old Rome.                                 170

    _Cæs._           An indifferent song
    For those within the walls, methinks, to hear.

    _Arn._ Yes, if they keep to their chorus. But here comes
    The general with his chiefs and men of trust[dj].
    A goodly rebel.

          _Enter the Constable_ BOURBON _"cum suis," etc., etc._

    _Phil._          How now, noble Prince,
    You are not cheerful?

    _Bourb._             Why should I be so?

    _Phil._ Upon the eve of conquest, such as ours,
    Most men would be so.

    _Bourb._               If I were secure!

    _Phil._ Doubt not our soldiers. Were the walls of adamant,
    They'd crack them. Hunger is a sharp artillery.                    180

    _Bourb._ That they will falter is my least of fears.
    That they will be repulsed, with Bourbon for
    Their chief, and all their kindled appetites
    To marshal them on--were those hoary walls
    Mountains, and those who guard them like the gods
    Of the old fables, I would trust my Titans;--
    But now----

    _Phil._    They are but men who war with mortals.

    _Bourb._ True: but those walls have girded in great ages,
    And sent forth mighty spirits. The past earth
    And present phantom of imperious Rome[dk]                          190
    Is peopled with those warriors; and methinks
    They flit along the eternal City's rampart,
    And stretch their glorious, gory, shadowy hands,
    And beckon me away!

    _Phil._            So let them! Wilt thou
    Turn back from shadowy menaces of shadows?

    _Bourb._ They do not menace me. I could have faced,
    Methinks, a Sylla's menace; but they clasp,
    And raise, and wring their dim and deathlike hands,
    And with their thin aspen faces and fixed eyes
    Fascinate mine. Look there!

    _Phil._                    I look upon                             200
    A lofty battlement.

    _Bourb._            And there!

    _Phil._                       Not even
    A guard in sight; they wisely keep below,
    Sheltered by the grey parapet from some
    Stray bullet of our lansquenets, who might
    Practise in the cool twilight.

    _Bourb._                      You are blind.

    _Phil._ If seeing nothing more than may be seen
    Be so.

    _Bourb._ A thousand years have manned the walls
    With all their heroes,--the last Cato[237] stands
    And tears his bowels, rather than survive
    The liberty of that I would enslave.                               210
    And the first Cassar with his triumphs flits
    From battlement to battlement.

    _Phil._                        Then conquer
    The walls for which he conquered and be greater!

    _Bourb._ True: so I will, or perish.

    _Phil._                              You can _not_.
    In such an enterprise to die is rather
    The dawn of an eternal day, than death.
                                   [_Count_ ARNOLD _and_ CÆSAR _advance_.

    _Cæs._ And the mere men--do they, too, sweat beneath
    The noon of this same ever-scorching glory?

    _Bourb._                                   Ah!
    Welcome the bitter Hunchback! and his master,
    The beauty of our host, and brave as beauteous,                    220
    And generous as lovely. We shall find
    Work for you both ere morning.

    _Cæs._                        You will find,
    So please your Highness, no less for yourself.

    _Bourb._ And if I do, there will not be a labourer
    More forward, Hunchback!

    _Cæs._                  You may well say so,
    For _you_ have seen that back--as general,
    Placed in the rear in action--but your foes
    Have never seen it.

    _Bourb._           That's a fair retort,
    For I provoked it:--but the Bourbon's breast
    Has been, and ever shall be, far advanced                          230
    In danger's face as yours, were you the _devil_.

    _Cæs._ And if I were, I might have saved myself
    The toil of coming here.

    _Phil._                 Why so?

    _Cæs._                         One half
    Of your brave bands of their own bold accord
    Will go to him, the other half be sent,
    More swiftly, not less surely.

    _Bourb._                      Arnold, your
    Slight crooked _friend's_ as snake-like in his words
    As his deeds.

    _Cæs._        Your Highness much mistakes me.
    The first snake was a flatterer--I am none;
    And for my deeds, I only sting when stung.                         240

    _Bourb._ You are brave, and _that's_ enough for me; and quick
    In speech as sharp in action--and that's more.
    I am not alone the soldier, but the soldiers'
    Comrade.

    _Cæs._   They are but bad company, your Highness;
    And worse even for their friends than foes, as being
    More permanent acquaintance.

    _Phil._                      How now, fellow!
    Thou waxest insolent, beyond the privilege
    Of a buffoon.

    _Cæs._       You mean I speak the truth.
    I'll lie--it is as easy: then you'll praise me
    For calling you a hero.

    _Bourb._               Philibert!                                  250
    Let him alone; he's brave, and ever has
    Been first, with that swart face and mountain shoulder,
    In field or storm, and patient in starvation;
    And for his tongue, the camp is full of licence,
    And the sharp stinging of a lively rogue
    Is, to my mind, far preferable to
    The gross, dull, heavy, gloomy execration
    Of a mere famished sullen grumbling slave,[dl]
    Whom nothing can convince save a full meal,
    And wine, and sleep, and a few Maravedis,                          260
    With which he deems him rich.

    _Cæs._                        It would be well
    If the earth's princes asked no more.

    _Bourb._                             Be silent!

    _Cæs._ Aye, but not idle. Work yourself with words![dm]
    You have few to speak.

    _Phil._                What means the audacious prater?

    _Cæs._ To prate, like other prophets.

    _Bourb._                              Philibert!
    Why will you vex him? Have we not enough
    To think on? Arnold! I will lead the attack
    To-morrow.

    _Arn._     I have heard as much, my Lord.

    _Bourb._ And you will follow?

    _Arn._                        Since I must not lead.

    _Bourb._ 'Tis necessary for the further daring
    Of our too needy army, that their chief
    Plant the first foot upon the foremost ladder's
    First step.

    _Cæs._      Upon its topmost, let us hope:
    So shall he have his full deserts.

    _Bourb._                          The world's
    Great capital perchance is ours to-morrow.[dn]
    Through every change the seven-hilled city hath
    Retained her sway o'er nations, and the Cæsars
    But yielded to the Alarics, the Alarics
    Unto the pontiffs. Roman, Goth, or priest.
    Still the world's masters! Civilised, barbarian,
    Or saintly, still the walls of Romulus
    Have been the circus of an Empire. Well!
    'Twas _their_ turn--now 'tis ours; and let us hope
    That we will fight as well, and rule much better.

    _Cæs._ No doubt, the camp's the school of civic rights.
    What would you make of Rome?

    _Bourb._                    That which it was.

    _Cæs._ In Alaric's time?

    _Bourb._                 No, slave! in the first Cæsar's,
    Whose name you bear like other curs----

    _Cæs._                             And kings!
    'Tis a great name for blood-hounds.

    _Bourb._                           There's a demon
    In that fierce rattlesnake thy tongue. Wilt never
    Be serious?

    _Cæs._      On the eve of battle, no;--
    That were not soldier-like. 'Tis for the general
    To be more pensive: we adventurers
    Must be more cheerful. Wherefore should we think?
    Our tutelar Deity, in a leader's shape,
    Takes care of us. Keep thought aloof from hosts!
    If the knaves take to thinking, you will have
    To crack those walls alone.

    _Bourb._                    You may sneer, since
    'Tis lucky for you that you fight no worse for 't.

    _Cæs._ I thank you for the freedom; 'tis the only                  300
    Pay I have taken in your Highness' service.

    _Bourb._ Well, sir, to-morrow you shall pay yourself.
    Look on those towers; they hold my treasury:
    But, Philibert, we'll in to council. Arnold,
    We would request your presence.

    _Arn._                          Prince! my service
    Is yours, as in the field.

    _Bourb._                   In both we prize it,
    And yours will be a post of trust at daybreak.

    _Cæs._ And mine?

    _Bourb._         To follow glory with the Bourbon.
    Good night!

    _Arn._ (_to_ CÆSAR). Prepare our armour for the assault,
    And wait within my tent.
                              [_Exeunt_ BOURBON, ARNOLD, PHILIBERT, _etc._

    _Cæs._ (_solus_).       Within thy tent!                           310
    Think'st thou that I pass from thee with my presence?
    Or that this crooked coffer, which contained
    Thy principle of life, is aught to me
    Except a mask? And these are men, forsooth!
    Heroes and chiefs, the flower of Adam's bastards!
    This is the consequence of giving matter
    The power of thought. It is a stubborn substance,
    And thinks chaotically, as it acts,
    Ever relapsing into its first elements.
    Well! I must play with these poor puppets: 'tis                    320
    The Spirit's pastime in his idler hours.
    When I grow weary of it, I have business
    Amongst the stars, which these poor creatures deem
    Were made for them to look at. 'Twere a jest now
    To bring one down amongst them, and set fire
    Unto their anthill: how the pismires then
    Would scamper o'er the scalding soil, and, ceasing
    From tearing down each other's nests, pipe forth
    One universal orison! ha! ha!                          [_Exit_ CÆSAR.




                                 PART II.


          SCENE I.--_Before the walls of Rome.--The Assault: the
          Army in motion, with ladders to scale the walls_;[238]
         BOURBON _with a white scarf over his armour, foremost_.

                     _Chorus of Spirits in the air_.

                    I.

    'Tis the morn, but dim and dark.[do]
    Whither flies the silent lark?
    Whither shrinks the clouded sun?
    Is the day indeed begun?
    Nature's eye is melancholy
    O'er the city high and holy:
    But without there is a din
    Should arouse the saints within,
    And revive the heroic ashes
    Round which yellow Tiber dashes.                                    10
    Oh, ye seven hills! awaken,
    Ere your very base be shaken!

                    II.

    Hearken to the steady stamp!
    Mars is in their every tramp!
    Not a step is out of tune,
    As the tides obey the moon!
    On they march, though to self-slaughter,
    Regular as rolling water,
    Whose high-waves o'ersweep the border
    Of huge moles, but keep their order,                                20
    Breaking only rank by rank.
    Hearken to the armour's clank!
    Look down o'er each frowning warrior,
    How he glares upon the barrier:
    Look on each step of each ladder,
    As the stripes that streak an adder.

                    III.

    Look upon the bristling wall,
    Manned without an interval!
    Round and round, and tier on tier,
    Cannon's black mouth, shining spear,                                30
    Lit match, bell-mouthed Musquetoon,
    Gaping to be murderous soon;
    All the warlike gear of old,
    Mixed with what we now behold,
    In this strife 'twixt old and new,
    Gather like a locusts' crew.
    Shade of Remus! 'tis a time
    Awful as thy brother's crime!
    Christians war against Christ's shrine:--
    Must its lot be like to thine?                                      40

                    IV.

    Near--and near--and nearer still,
    As the Earthquake saps the hill,
    First with trembling, hollow motion,
    Like a scarce awakened ocean,
    Then with stronger shock and louder,
    Till the rocks are crushed to powder,--
    Onward sweeps the rolling host!
    Heroes of the immortal boast!
    Mighty Chiefs! eternal shadows!
    First flowers of the bloody meadows                                 50
    Which encompass Rome, the mother
    Of a people without brother!
    Will you sleep when nations' quarrels
    Plough the root up of your laurels?
    Ye who weep o'er Carthage burning,
    Weep not--_strike_! for Rome is mourning![239]

                    V.

    Onward sweep the varied nations!
    Famine long hath dealt their rations.
    To the wall, with hate and hunger,
    Numerous as wolves, and stronger,                                   60
    On they sweep. Oh, glorious City!
    Must thou be a theme for pity?
    Fight, like your first sire, each Roman!
    Alaric was a gentle foeman,
    Matched with Bourbon's black banditti!
    Rouse thee, thou eternal City;
    Rouse thee! Rather give the torch
    With thine own hand to thy porch,[dp]
    Than behold such hosts pollute
    Your worst dwelling with their foot.                                70

                    VI.

    Ah! behold yon bleeding spectre!
    Ilion's children find no Hector;
    Priam's offspring loved their brother;
    Rome's great sire forgot his mother,
    When he slew his gallant twin,
    With inexpiable sin.
    See the giant shadow stride
    O'er the ramparts high and wide!
    When the first o'erleapt thy wall,
    Its foundation mourned thy fall.                                    80
    Now, though towering like a Babel,
    Who to stop his steps are able?
    Stalking o'er thy highest dome,
    Remus claims his vengeance, Rome!

                    VII.

    Now they reach thee in their anger:
    Fire and smoke and hellish clangour
    Are around thee, thou world's wonder!
    Death is in thy walls and under.
    Now the meeting steel first clashes,
    Downward then the ladder crashes,                                   90
    With its iron load all gleaming,
    Lying at its foot blaspheming!
    Up again! for every warrior
    Slain, another climbs the barrier.
    Thicker grows the strife: thy ditches
    Europe's mingling gore enriches.
    Rome! although thy wall may perish,
    Such manure thy fields will cherish,
    Making gay the harvest-home;
    But thy hearths, alas! oh, Rome!--                                 100
    Yet be Rome amidst thine anguish,
    Fight as thou wast wont to vanquish!

                    VIII.

    Yet once more, ye old Penates!
    Let not your quenched hearts be Atés!
    Yet again, ye shadowy Heroes,
    Yield not to these stranger Neros!
    Though the son who slew his mother
    Shed Rome's blood, he was your brother:
    'Twas the Roman curbed the Roman;--
    Brennus was a baffled foeman.                                      110
    Yet again, ye saints and martyrs,
    Rise! for yours are holier charters!
    Mighty Gods of temples falling,
    Yet in ruin still appalling!
    Mightier Founders of those altars,
    True and Christian,--strike the assaulters!
    Tiber! Tiber! let thy torrent
    Show even Nature's self abhorrent.
    Let each breathing heart dilated
    Turn, as doth the lion baited!                                     120
    Rome be crashed to one wide tomb,
    But be still the Roman's Rome![240]

                 [BOURBON, ARNOLD, CÆSAR, _and others, arrive at the foot
                      of the wall_. ARNOLD _is about to plant his ladder_.

    _Bourb._ Hold, Arnold! I am first.

    _Arn._                             Not so, my Lord.

    _Bourb._ Hold, sir, I charge you! Follow! I am proud
    Of such a follower, but will brook no leader.
                        [BOURBON _plants his ladder, and begins to mount_.
    Now, boys! On! on!
                               [_A shot strikes him, and_ BOURBON _falls_.

    _Cæs._             And off!

    _Arn._                     Eternal powers!
    The host will be appalled,--but vengeance! vengeance!

    _Bourb._ 'Tis nothing--lend me your hand.

                      [BOURBON _takes_ ARNOLD _by the hand, and rises; but
                            as he puts his foot on the step, falls again_.

                                           Arnold! I am sped.
    Conceal my fall[241]--all will go well--conceal it!
    Fling my cloak o'er what will be dust anon;                        130
    Let not the soldiers see it.

    _Arn._                     You must be
    Removed; the aid of----

    _Bourb._                No, my gallant boy!
    Death is upon me. But what is _one_ life?
    The Bourbon's spirit shall command them still.
    Keep them yet ignorant that I am but clay,
    Till they are conquerors--then do as you may.

    _Cæs._ Would not your Highness choose to kiss the cross?
    We have no priest here, but the hilt of sword
    May serve instead:--it did the same for Bayard[242].

    _Bourb._ Thou bitter slave! to name _him_ at this time!            140
    But I deserve it.

    _Arn._ (_to_ CÆSAR). Villain, hold your peace!

    _Cæs._ What, when a Christian dies? Shall I not offer
    A Christian "Vade in pace[243]?"

    _Arn._                        Silence! Oh!
    Those eyes are glazing which o'erlooked the world,
    And saw no equal.

    _Bourb._          Arnold, shouldst thou see
    France----But hark! hark! the assault grows warmer--Oh!
    For but an hour, a minute more of life,
    To die within the wall! Hence, Arnold, hence!
    You lose time--they will conquer Rome without thee.

    _Arn._ And without _thee_.

    _Bourb._                   Not so; I'll lead them still            150
    In spirit. Cover up my dust, and breathe not
    That I have ceased to breathe. Away! and be
    Victorious.

    _Arn._      But I must not leave thee thus.

    _Bourb._ You must--farewell--Up! up! the world is winning.
                                                          [BOURBON _dies_.

    His hand is on the battlement--he grasps it
    As though it were an altar; now his foot
    Is on it, and----What have we here?--a Roman?
    The first bird of the covey! he has fallen             [_A man falls_.

    But somewhat late i' the day. Where shall we bear her?
    I say she lives.

    _Arn._          And will she live?

    _Cas._                             As much
    As dust can.

    _Arn._ Then she is dead!

    _Cæs._                   Bah! bah! You are so,
    And do not know it. She will come to life--
    Such as you think so, such as you now are;
    But we must work by human means.

    _Arn._                          We will                            160
    Convey her unto the Colonna palace,
    Where I have pitched my banner.

    _Cæs._                         Come then! raise her up!

    _Arn._ Softly!

    _Cæs._        As softly as they bear the dead,
    Perhaps because they cannot feel the jolting.

    _Arn._ But doth she live indeed?

    _Cæs._                           Nay, never fear!
    But, if you rue it after, blame not me.

    _Arn._ Let her but live!

    _Cæs._                  The Spirit of her life
    Is yet within her breast, and may revive.
    Count! count! I am your servant in all things,
    And this is a new office:--'tis not oft                            170
    I am employed in such; but you perceive
    How staunch a friend is what you call a fiend.
    On earth you have often only fiends for friends;
    Now _I_ desert not mine. Soft! bear her hence,
    The beautiful half-clay, and nearly spirit!
    I am almost enamoured of her, as
    Of old the Angels of her earliest sex.[250]

    _Arn._ Thou!

    _Cæs._      I! But fear not. I'll not be your rival.

    _Arn._ Rival!

    _Cæs._       I could be one right formidable;
    But since I slew the seven husbands of                             180
    Tobias' future bride (and after all
    Was smoked out by some incense),[251] I have laid
    Aside intrigue: 'tis rarely worth the trouble
    Of gaining, or--what is more difficult--
    Getting rid of your prize again; for there's
    The rub! at least to mortals.

    _Arn._                       Prithee, peace!
    Softly! methinks her lips move, her eyes open!

    _Cæs._ Like stars, no doubt; for that's a metaphor
    For Lucifer and Venus.

    _Arn._                To the palace
    Colonna, as I told you!

    _Cæs._                 Oh! I know                                  190
    My way through Rome.

    _Arn._              Now onward, onward! Gently!
                           [_Exeunt, bearing_ OLIMPIA. _The scene closes_.




                                PART III.


      SCENE I.--_A Castle in the Apennines, surrounded by a wild but
      smiling Country. Chorus of Peasants singing before the Gates_.

                                _Chorus_.

                    I.

             The wars are over,
               The spring is come;
             The bride and her lover
               Have sought their home:
    They are happy, we rejoice;
    Let their hearts have an echo in every voice!

                    II.

    The spring is come; the violet's gone,
    The first-born child of the early sun:[dt]
    With us she is but a winter's flower,
    The snow on the hills cannot blast her bower,                       10
    And she lifts up her dewy eye of blue
    To the youngest sky of the self-same hue.

                    III.

    And when the spring comes with her host
    Of flowers, that flower beloved the most
    Shrinks from the crowd that may confuse
    Her heavenly odour and virgin hues.

                    IV.

    Pluck the others, but still remember
    Their herald out of dim December--
    The morning star of all the flowers,
    The pledge of daylight's lengthened hours;                          20
    Nor, midst the roses, e'er forget
    The virgin--virgin Violet.

                             _Enter_ CÆSAR.

                          _Cæs._ (_singing_).
    The wars are all over,
      Our swords are all idle,
      The steed bites the bridle,
    The casque's on the wall.
    There's rest for the rover;
      But his armour is rusty,
      And the veteran grows crusty,
    As he yawns in the hall.                                            30
      He drinks--but what's drinking?
      A mere pause from thinking!
    No bugle awakes him with life-and-death call.

                               _Chorus_.

        But the hound bayeth loudly,
          The boar's in the wood,
        And the falcon longs proudly
          To spring from her hood:
        On the wrist of the noble
          She sits like a crest,
        And the air is in trouble                                       40
          With birds from their nest.

                                _Cæs_.
        Oh! shadow of Glory!
          Dim image of War!
        But the chase hath no story,
          Her hero no star,
        Since Nimrod, the founder
          Of empire and chase,
        Who made the woods wonder
          And quake for their race.
        When the lion was young,                                        50
          In the pride of his might,
        Then 'twas sport for the strong
          To embrace him in fight;
        To go forth, with a pine
          For a spear, 'gainst the mammoth,
        Or strike through the ravine[du]
          At the foaming behemoth;
        While man was in stature
          As towers in our time,
        The first born of Nature,                                       60
          And, like her, sublime!

                                    _Chorus_.

        But the wars are over,
          The spring is come;
        The bride and her lover
          Have sought their home:
    They are happy, and we rejoice;
    Let their hearts have an echo from every voice!
                                         [_Exeunt the Peasantry, singing_.




        FRAGMENT OF THE THIRD PART OF _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.


                                _Chorus_.

    When the merry bells are ringing,
    And the peasant girls are singing,
    And the early flowers are flinging
      Their odours in the air;
    And the honey bee is clinging
    To the buds; and birds are winging
      Their way, pair by pair:
    Then the earth looks free from trouble
    With the brightness of a bubble:
    Though I did not make it,                                           10
    I could breathe on and break it;
    But too much I scorn it,
    Or else I would mourn it,
    To see despots and slaves
    Playing o'er their own graves.

                          _Enter_ COUNT ARNOLD.

            {_Mem._ Jealous--Arnold of Cæsar.
            {Olympia at first not liking Cæsar
            {--then?--Arnold jealous of himself
            {under his former figure, owing to
            {the power of intellect, etc., etc., etc.

    _Arnold_. You are merry, Sir--what? singing too?

    _Cæsar_.                                         It is
    The land of Song--and Canticles you know
    Were once my avocation.

    _Arn._              Nothing moves you;
    You scoff even at your own calamity--
    And such calamity! how wert thou fallen                             20
    Son of the Morning! and yet Lucifer
    Can smile.

    _Cæs._     His shape can--would you have me weep,
    In the fair form I wear, to please you?

    _Arn._                                 Ah!

    _Cæs._ You are grave--what have you on your spirit!

    _Arn._                                               Nothing.

    _Cæs._ How mortals lie by instinct! If you ask
    A disappointed courtier--What's the matter?
    "Nothing"--an outshone Beauty what has made
    Her smooth brow crisp--"Oh, Nothing!"--a young heir
    When his Sire has recovered from the Gout,
    What ails him? "Nothing!" or a Monarch who 30
    Has heard the truth, and looks imperial on it--
    What clouds his royal aspect? "Nothing," "Nothing!"
    Nothing--eternal nothing--of these nothings
    All are a lie--for all to them are much!
    And they themselves alone the real "Nothings."
    Your present Nothing, too, is something to you--
    What is it?

    _Arn._      Know you not?

    _Cæs._                   I only know
    What I desire to know! and will not waste
    Omniscience upon phantoms. Out with it!
    If you seek aid from me--or else be silent.                         40
    And eat your thoughts--till they breed snakes within you.

    _Arn._ Olimpia!

    _Cæs._          I thought as much--go on.

    _Arn._ I thought she had loved me.

    _Cæs._                             Blessings on your Creed!
    What a good Christian you were found to be!
    But what cold Sceptic hath appalled your faith
    And transubstantiated to crumbs again
    The _body_ of your Credence?

    _Arn._                      No one--but--
    Each day--each hour--each minute shows me more
    And more she loves me not--

    _Cæs._                     Doth she rebel?

    _Arn._ No, she is calm, and meek, and silent with me,               50
    And coldly dutiful, and proudly patient--
    Endures my Love--not meets it.

    _Cæs._                        That seems strange.
    You are beautiful and brave! the first is much
    For passion--and the rest for Vanity.

    _Arn._ I saved her life, too; and her Father's life,
    And Father's house from ashes.

    _Cæs._                        These are nothing.
    You seek for Gratitude--the Philosopher's stone.

    _Arn._ And find it not.

    _Cæs._                  You cannot find what is not.
    But _found_ would it content you? would you owe
    To thankfulness what you desire from Passion?                       60
    No! No! you would be _loved_--what you call loved--
    _Self-loved_--loved for _yourself_--for neither health,
    Nor wealth, nor youth, nor power, nor rank, nor beauty--
    For these you may be stript of--but _beloved_
    As an abstraction--for--you know not what!
    These are the wishes of a moderate lover--
    And _so_ you love.

    _Arn._             Ah! could I be beloved,
    Would I ask wherefore?

    _Cæs._               Yes! and not believe
    The answer--You are jealous.

    _Arn._                       And of whom?

    _Cæs._ It may be of yourself,[252] for Jealousy                     70
    Is as a shadow of the Sun. The Orb
    Is mighty--as you mortals deem--and to
    Your little Universe seems universal;
    But, great as He appears, and is to you,
    The smallest cloud--the slightest vapour of
    Your humid earth enables you to look
    Upon a Sky which you revile as dull;
    Though your eyes dare not gaze on it when cloudless.
    Nothing can blind a mortal like to light.
    Now Love in you is as the Sun--a thing                              80
    Beyond you--and your Jealousy's of Earth--
    A cloud of your own raising.

    _Arn._                       Not so always!
    There is a cause at times.

    _Cæs._                    Oh, yes! when atoms jostle,
    The System is in peril. But I speak
    Of things you know not. Well, to earth again!
    This precious thing of dust--this bright Olimpia--
    This marvellous Virgin, is a marble maid--
    An Idol, but a cold one to your heat
    Promethean, and unkindled by your torch.

    _Arn._ Slave!

    _Cæs._         In the victor's Chariot, when Rome triumphed,        90
    There was a Slave of yore to tell him truth!
    You are a Conqueror--command your Slave.

    _Arn._ Teach me the way to win the woman's love.

    _Cæs._ Leave her.

    _Arn._            Where that the path--I'd not pursue it.

    _Cæs._ No doubt! for if you did, the remedy
    Would be for a disease already cured.

    _Arn._ All wretched as I am, I would not quit
    My unrequited love, for all that's happy.

    _Cæs._ You have possessed the woman--still possess.
    What need you more?

    _Arn._         To be myself possessed--                            100
    To be her heart as she is mine.

FOOTNOTES:

[201] {473}[_The Three Brothers_, by Joshua Pickersgill, junior, was
published in 1803. There is no copy of _The Three Brothers_ in the
British Museum. The following extracts are taken from a copy in the
Bodleian Library at Oxford (vol. 4, cap. xi. pp. 229-350):--

"Arnaud, the natural son of the Marquis de Souvricour, was a child
'extraordinary in Beauty and Intellect.' When travelling with his
parents to Languedoc, Arnaud being 8 years old, he was shot at by
banditti, and forsaken by his parents. The Captain of the band nursed
him. 'But those perfections to which Arnaud owed his existence, ceased
to adorn it. The ball had gored his shoulder, and the fall had
dislocated it; by the latter misadventure his spine likewise was so
fatally injured as to be irrecoverable to its pristine uprightness.
Injuries so compound confounded the Captain, who sorrowed to see a
creature so charming, at once deformed by a crooked back and an
excrescent shoulder.' Arnaud was found and taken back to his parents.
'The bitterest consciousness of his deformity was derived from their
indelicate, though, perhaps, insensible alteration of conduct.... Of his
person he continued to speak as of an abhorrent enemy.... "Were a
blessing submitted to my choice, I would say, [said Arnaud] be it my
immediate dissolution." "I think," said his mother, ... "that you could
wish better." "Yes," adjoined Arnaud, "for that wish should be that I
ever had remained unborn."' He polishes the broken blade of a sword, and
views himself therein; the sight so horrifies him that he determines to
throw himself over a precipice, but draws back at the last moment. He
goes to a cavern, and conjures up the prince of hell. "Arnaud knew
himself to be interrogated. What he required.... What was that answer
the effects explain.... There passed in liveliest portraiture the
various men distinguished for that beauty and grace which Arnaud so much
desired, that he was ambitious to purchase them with his soul. He felt
that it was his part to chuse whom he would resemble, yet he remained
unresolved, though the spectator of an hundred shades of renown, among
which glided by Alexander, Alcibiades, and Hephestion: at length
appeared the supernatural effigy of a man, whose perfections human
artist never could depict or insculp--Demetrius, the son of Antigonus.
Arnaud's heart heaved quick with preference, and strait he found within
his hand the resemblance of a poniard, its point inverted towards his
breast. A mere automaton in the hands of the Demon, he thrust the point
through his heart, and underwent a painless death. During his trance,
his spirit metempsychosed from the body of his detestation to that of
his admiration ... Arnaud awoke a Julian!'"]

form was never published.]

[203] [Mrs. Shelley inscribed the following note on the fly-leaf of her
copy of _The Deformed Transformed_:--

"This had long been a favourite subject with Lord Byron. I think that he
mentioned it also in Switzerland. I copied it--he sending a portion of
it at a time, as it was finished, to me. At this time he had a great
horror of its being said that he plagiarised, or that he studied for
ideas, and wrote with difficulty. Thus he gave Shelley Aikins' edition
of the British poets, that it might not be found in his house by some
English lounger, and reported home; thus, too, he always dated when he
began and when he ended a poem, to prove hereafter how quickly it was
done. I do not think that he altered a line in this drama after he had
once written it down. He composed and corrected in his mind. I do not
know how he meant to finish it; but he said himself that the whole
conduct of the story was already conceived. It was at this time that a
brutal paragraph[*] alluding to his lameness appeared, which he repeated
to me lest I should hear it from some one else. No action of Lord
Byron's life--scarce a line he has written--but was influenced by his
personal defect."

[*] It is possible that Mrs. Shelley alludes to a sentence in the
_Memoirs, etc., of Lord Byron_. (by Dr. John Watkin), 1822, p. 46: "A
malformation of one of his feet, and other indications of a rickety
constitution, served as a plea for suffering him to range the hills and
to wander about at his pleasure on the seashore, that his frame might be
invigorated by air and exercise."]

[204] [Moore (_Life_, p. 13) quotes these lines in connection with a
passage in Byron's "Memoranda," where, in speaking of his own
sensitiveness on the subject of his deformed foot, he described the
feeling of horror and humiliation that came over him, when his mother,
in one of her fits of passion, called him "_a lame brat!_"... "It may
be questioned," he adds, "whether that whole drama [_The Deformed
Transformed_] was not indebted for its origin to that single
recollection."

Byron's early letters (_e.g._ November 2, 11, 17, 1804, _Letters_, 1898,
i. 41, 45, 48) are full of complaints of his mother's "eccentric
behaviour," her "fits of phrenzy," her "caprices," "passions," and so
forth; and there is convincing proof--see _Life_, pp. 28, 306;
_Letters_, 1898, ii. 122 (incident at Bellingham's execution);
_Letters_, 1901, vi. 179 (_Le Diable Boiteux_)--that he regarded the
contraction of the muscles of his legs as a more or less repulsive
deformity. And yet, to quote one of a hundred testimonies,--"with regard
to Lord Byron's features, Mr. Mathews observed, that he was the only man
he ever contemplated, to whom he felt disposed to apply the word
_beautiful_" (_Memoirs of Charles Matthews_, 1838, ii. 380). The
looker-on or the consoler computes the magnitude and the liberality of
the compensation. The sufferer thinks only of his sufferings.]

his profligacy--"the citadel was so polluted with his debaucheries, that
it appeared to be kept sacred in some degree when he indulged himself
only with such _Hetæræ_ as Chrysis, Lamia, Demo, and Anticyra." He was

Antigonus, had been told that he was indisposed, "he went to see him;
and when he came to the door, he met one of his favourites going out. He
went in, however, and, sitting down by him, took hold of his hand. 'My

[230] [Charles de Bourbon, Comte de Montpensier et de la Marche, Dauphin
d'Auvergne, was born February 17, 1490. He served in Italy with Bayard,
and helped to decide the victory of Agnadello (A.D. 1510). He was
appointed Constable of France by Francis I., January, 1515, and fought
at the battle of Marignano, September 13, 1515. Not long afterwards he
lost the king's favour, who was set against him by his mother, Louise de
Savoie; was recalled from his command in Italy, and superseded by Odet
de Foix, brother of the king's mistress. It was not, however, till he
became a widower (Susanne, Duchesse de Bourbon, died April 28, 1521)
that he finally broke with Francis and attached himself to the Emperor
Charles V. _Madame_, the king's mother, not only coveted the vast
estates of the house of Bourbon, but was enamoured of the Constable's
person, and, so to speak, gave him his choice between marriage and a
suit for his fiefs. Charles would have nothing to say to the lady's
proposals or to her son's entreaties, and seeing that rejection meant
ruin, he "entered into a correspondence with the Emperor and the King
[Henry VIII.] of England ... and, finding this discovered, went into the
Emperor's service."

After various and varying successes, both in the South of France and in
Lombardy, he found himself, in the spring of 1527, not so much the
commander-in-chief as the popular _capo_ of a mixed body of German,
Spanish, and Italian _condottieri_, unpaid and ill-disciplined, who had
mutinied more than once, who could only be kept together by the prospect
of unlimited booty, and a timely concession to their demands. "To Rome!
to Rome!" cried the hungry and tumultuous _landsknechts_, and on May 5,
1527, the "late Constable of France," at the head of an army of 30,000
troops, appeared before the walls of the sacred city. On the morning of
the 6th of May, he was killed by a shot from an arquebuse. His epitaph
recounts his honours: "Aucto Imperio, Gallo victo, Superatâ Italiâ,
Pontifice obsesso, Româ captâ, Borbonius, Hic Jacet;" but in Paris they
painted the sill of his gate-way yellow, because he was a renegade and a
traitor. He could not have said, with the dying Bayard, "Ne me plaignez
pas-je meurs sans avoir servi contre _ma patrie, mon roy_, et mon
serment." (See _Modern Universal History_, 1760, xxiv. 150-152, Note C;

against Rome were at least six thousand Landsknechts, ardent converts to

Catholics and the destruction of altars and crucifixes. Their leader,
George Frundsberg, had set out for Rome with the pious intention of
hanging the Pope (see _The Popes of Rome_, by Leopold Ranke, translated
by Sarah Austen, 1866, i. 72). Brantôme (_Memoirs de Messire Pierre de
Bourdeille_.... Leyde, 1722, i. 230) gives a vivid picture of their
fanatical savagery: "Leur cruauté ne s'estendit pas seulement sur les
personnes, mais sur les marbres et les anciennes statuës. Les

Antichrist became an article of the Lutheran creed. Compare the

                   INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.


_The Age of Bronze_ was begun in December, 1822, and finished on January
10, 1823. "I have sent," he writes (letter to Leigh Hunt, _Letters_,
1901, vi. 160), "to Mrs. S[helley], for the benefit of being copied, a
poem of about seven hundred and fifty lines length--The Age of
Bronze,--or _Carmen Seculare et Annus haud Mirabilis_, with this
Epigraph--'Impar _Congressus_ Achilli.' It is calculated for the reading
part of the million, being all on politics, etc., etc., etc., and a
review of the day in general,--in my early _English Bards_ style, but a
little more stilted, and somewhat too full of 'epithets of war' and
classical and historical allusions. If notes are necessary, they can be
added."

On March 5th he forwarded the "Proof in Slips" ("and certainly the
_Slips_ are the most conspicuous part of it") to his new publisher, John
Hunt; and, on April 1, 1823, _The Age of Bronze_ was published, but not
with the author's name.

Ten years had gone by since he had published, only to disclaim, the
latest of his boyish satires, _The Waltz_, and more than six years since
he had written, "at the request of Douglas Kinnaird," the stilted and
laboured _Monody on the Death of ... Sheridan_. In the interval
(1816-1822) he had essayed any and every measure but the heroic, and, at
length, as a tardy recognition of his allegiance to "the great moral
poet of all times, of all climes, of all feelings, and of all stages of
existence" (_Observations upon "Observations,"_ _Letters_, 1901, v.
590), he reverts, as he believes, to his "early _English Bards_ style,"
the style of Pope.

The brazen age, the "Annus Haud Mirabilis," which the satirist would
hold up to scorn, was 1822, the year after Napoleon's death, which
witnessed a revolution in Spain, and the Congress of Allied Sovereigns
at Verona. Earlier in the year, the publication of Las Cases' _Memorial
de S^te^ Hélène_, and of O'Meara's _Napoleon in Exile, or a Voice from
St. Helena_, had created a sensation on both sides of the Channel.
Public opinion had differed as to the system on which Napoleon should be
treated--and, since his death, there had been a conflict of evidence as
to the manner in which he had been treated, at St. Helena. Tories
believed that an almost excessive lenience and indulgence had been
wasted on a graceless and thankless intriguer, while the "Opposition,"
Liberals or Radicals, were moved to indignation at the hardships and
restrictions which were ruthlessly and needlessly imposed on a fallen
and powerless foe. It was, and is, a very pretty quarrel; and Byron,
whose lifelong admiration for his "Héros de Roman" was tempered by
reason, approached the Longwood controversy somewhat in the spirit of a
partisan.

In _The Age of Bronze_ (sects, iii.-v.) he touches on certain incidents
of the "Last Phase" of Napoleon's career, and proceeds to recapitulate,
in a sort of _Memoria Technica_, the chief events of his history, from
the dawn at Marengo to the sunset at "bloody and most bootless
Waterloo," and draws the unimpeachable moral that "Honesty is the best
policy," even when the "game is Empire" and "the stakes are thrones"!

From the rise and fall, the tyranny and captivity of Napoleon, he passes
on to the Congress of Allied Powers, which met at Verona in November,
1822.

The "Congress" is the object of his satire. It had assembled with a
parade of power and magnificence, and had dispersed with little or
nothing accomplished. It was "impar Achilli" (_vide ante_, p. 535,
note 1), an empty menace, ill-matched with the revolutionary spirit,
and in pitiful contrast to the _Sic volo, sic jubeo_ of the dead
Napoleon.

The immediate and efficient cause of the Congress of Verona was the
success of the revolution in Spain. The point at issue between Spanish
Liberals and Royalists, or _serviles_, was the adherence to, or the
evasion of, the democratic Constitution of 1812. At the moment the
Liberals were in the ascendant, and, as Chateaubriand puts it, had
driven King Ferdinand into captivity, at Urgel, in Catalonia, to the
tune of the Spanish Marseillaise, "_Tragala, Tragala_" "swallow it,
swallow it," that is, "accept the Constitution." On July 7, 1822, a
government was established under the name of the "Supreme Regency of
Spain during the Captivity of the King," and, hence, the consternation
of the partners of the Holy Alliance, especially France, who conceived,
or feigned to conceive, that revolution next door was a source of danger
to constitutional government at home. To meet the emergency, a Congress
was summoned in the first instance at Vienna, and afterwards at Verona.
Thither came the sovereigns of Europe, great and small, accompanied by
their chancellors and ministers. The Czar Alexander was attended by
Count Nesselrode and Count Pozzo di Borgo; the Emperor Francis of
Austria, by Metternich and Prince Esterhazy; the King of Prussia
(Frederic William III.), by Count Bernstorff and Baron Humboldt. George
IV. of Great Britain, and Louis XVIII. of France, being elderly and
gouty, sent as their plenipotentiaries the Duke of Wellington and the
Vicomte de Montmorenci, accompanied, and, finally, superseded by, the
French ambassador, M. de Chateaubriand. Thither, too, came the smaller
fry, Kings of the Two Sicilies and of Sardinia; and last, but not least,
Marie Louise of Austria, Archduchess of Parma, _ci-devant_ widow of
Napoleon, and wife _sub rosâ_ of her one-eyed chamberlain, Count de
Neipperg. They met, they debated, they went to the theatre in state, and
finally decided to send monitory despatches to Spain, and to leave to
France a free hand to look after her own interests, and to go to war or
not, as she was pleased to determine. There was one dissentient, the
Duke of Wellington, who refused to sign the _procès verbaux_. His
Britannic Majesty had been advised to let the Spaniards alone, and not
to meddle with their internal affairs. The final outcome of the
Congress, the French invasion of Spain, could not be foreseen; and,
apparently, all that the Congress had accomplished was to refuse to
prohibit the exportation of negroes from Africa to America, and to
decline to receive the Greek deputies.

As the _Morning Chronicle_ (November 7, 1822) was pleased to put it,
"the Royal vultures have been deprived of their anticipated meal."

From the Holy Alliance and its antagonist, "the revolutionary stork,"
Byron turns to the landed and agricultural "interest" of Great Britain.
With the cessation of war and the resumption of cash payments in 1819,
prices had fallen some 50 per cent., and rents were beginning to fall.
Wheat, which in 1818 had fetched 80s. a quarter, in December, 1822, was
quoted at 39s. 11d.; consols were at 80. Poor rates had risen from
£2,000,000 in 1792 to £8,000,000 in 1822. How was the distress which
these changes involved to be met? By retrenchment and reform, by the
repeal of taxes, the reduction of salaries, by the landlords and
farmers, who had profited by war prices, submitting to the inevitable
reaction; or by sliding scales, by a return to an inflated currency,
perhaps by a repudiation of a portion of the funded debt?

The point of Byron's diatribe is that Squire Dives had enjoyed good
things during the war, and, now that the war was over, he had no
intention to let Lazarus have his turn; that, whoever suffered, it
should not be Dives; that patriotism had brought grist to his mill; and
that he proposed to suck no small advantage out of peace.

    "Year after year they voted cent. per cent.,
    Blood, sweat, and tear-wrung millions--why? for rent?
    They roared, they dined, they drank, they swore they meant
    To die for England--why then live?--for rent!"

It is easier to divine the "Sources" and the inspiration of _The Age of
Bronze_ than to place the reader _au courant_ with the literary and
political _causerie_ of the day. Byron wrote with O'Meara's book at his
elbow, and with batches of _Galignani's Messenger_, the _Morning
Chronicle_, and _Cobbett's Weekly Register_ within his reach. He was
under the impression that his lines would appear as an anonymous
contribution to _The Liberal_, and, in any case, he felt that he could
speak out, unchecked and uncriticized by friend or publisher. He was, so
to speak, unmuzzled.

With regard to the style and quality of his new satire, Byron was under
an amiable delusion. His couplets, he imagined, were in his "early
_English Bards_ style," but "more stilted." He did not realize that,
whatever the intervening years had taken away, they had "left behind"
experience and passion, and that he had learned to think and to feel.
The fault of the poem is that too much matter is packed into too small a
compass, and that, in parts, every line implies a minute acquaintance
with contemporary events, and requires an explanatory note. But, even
so, in _The Age of Bronze_ Byron has wedded "a striking passage of
history" to striking and imperishable verse.

                            THE AGE OF BRONZE.


                    I.

    The "good old times"--all times when old are good--
    Are gone; the present might be if they would;
    Great things have been, and are, and greater still
    Want little of mere mortals but their will:[dw]
    A wider space, a greener field, is given
    To those who play their "tricks before high heaven."[254]
    I know not if the angels weep, but men
    Have wept enough--for what?--to weep again!


                    II.

    All is exploded--be it good or bad.
    Reader! remember when thou wert a lad,                              10
    Then Pitt was all; or, if not all, so much,
    His very rival almost deemed him such.[255]
    We--we have seen the intellectual race
    Of giants stand, like Titans, face to face--
    Athos and Ida, with a dashing sea
    Of eloquence between, which flowed all free,
    As the deep billows of the Ægean roar
    Betwixt the Hellenic and the Phrygian shore.
    But where are they--the rivals! a few feet
    Of sullen earth divide each winding sheet.[256]                     20
    How peaceful and how powerful is the grave,
    Which hushes all! a calm, unstormy wave,
    Which oversweeps the World. The theme is old
    Of "Dust to Dust," but half its tale untold:
    Time tempers not its terrors--still the worm
    Winds its cold folds, the tomb preserves its form,
    Varied above, but still alike below;
    The urn may shine--the ashes will not glow--
    Though Cleopatra's mummy cross the sea[257]
    O'er which from empire she lured Anthony;                           30
    Though Alexander's urn[258] a show be grown
    On shores he wept to conquer, though unknown--[259]
    How vain, how worse than vain, at length appear
    The madman's wish, the Macedonian's tear!
    He wept for worlds to conquer--half the earth
    Knows not his name, or but his death, and birth,
    And desolation; while his native Greece
    Hath all of desolation, save its peace.
    He "wept for worlds to conquer!" he who ne'er
    Conceived the Globe, he panted not to spare!                        40
    With even the busy Northern Isle unknown,
    Which holds his urn--and never knew his throne.


                    III.

    But where is he, the modern, mightier far,
    Who, born no king, made monarchs draw his car;
    The new Sesostris, whose unharnessed kings,[260]
    Freed from the bit, believe themselves with wings,
    And spurn the dust o'er which they crawled of late,
    Chained to the chariot of the Chieftain's state?
    Yes! where is he, "the champion and the child"[261]
    Of all that's great or little--wise or wild;                        50
    Whose game was Empire, and whose stakes were thrones;
    Whose table Earth--whose dice were human bones?
    Behold the grand result in yon lone Isle,
    And, as thy nature urges--weep or smile.
    Sigh to behold the Eagle's lofty rage
    Reduced to nibble at his narrow cage;
    Smile to survey the queller of the nations
    Now daily squabbling o'er disputed rations;[dx][262]
    Weep to perceive him mourning, as he dines,
    O'er curtailed dishes and o'er stinted wines;                       60
    O'er petty quarrels upon petty things.
    Is this the Man who scourged or feasted kings?
    Behold the scales in which his fortune hangs,
    A surgeon's[263] statement, and an earl's[264] harangues!
    A bust delayed,[265]--a book[266] refused, can shake
    The sleep of Him who kept the world awake.
    Is this indeed the tamer of the Great,[dy]
    Now slave of all could tease or irritate--
    The paltry gaoler[267] and the prying spy,
    The staring stranger with his note-book nigh?[268]                  70
    Plunged in a dungeon, he had still been great;
    How low, how little was this middle state,
    Between a prison and a palace, where
    How few could feel for what he had to bear!
    Vain his complaint,--My Lord presents his bill,
    His food and wine were doled out duly still;
    Vain was his sickness, never was a clime
    So free from homicide--to doubt's crime;
    And the stiff surgeon,[269] who maintained his cause,
    Hath lost his place, and gained the world's applause.               80
    But smile--though all the pangs of brain and heart
    Disdain, defy, the tardy aid of art;
    Though, save the few fond friends and imaged face
    Of that fair boy his Sire shall ne'er embrace,
    None stand by his low bed--though even the mind
    Be wavering, which long awed and awes mankind:
    Smile--for the fettered Eagle breaks his chain,
    And higher Worlds than this are his again.[270]


                    IV.

    How, if that soaring Spirit still retain
    A conscious twilight of his blazing reign,                          90
    How must he smile, on looking down, to see
    The little that he was and sought to be!
    What though his Name a wider empire found
    Than his Ambition, though with scarce a bound;
    Though first in glory, deepest in reverse,
    He tasted Empire's blessings and its curse;
    Though kings, rejoicing in their late escape
    From chains, would gladly be _their_ Tyrant's ape;
    How must he smile, and turn to yon lone grave,
    The proudest Sea-mark that o'ertops the wave!                      100
    What though his gaoler, duteous to the last,
    Scarce deemed the coffin's lead could keep him fast,
    Refusing one poor line[271] along the lid,
    To date the birth and death of all it hid;
    That name shall hallow the ignoble shore,
    A talisman to all save him who bore:
    The fleets that sweep before the eastern blast
    Shall hear their sea-boys[272] hail it from the mast;
    When Victory's Gallic column[273] shall but rise,
    Like Pompey's pillar[274], in a desert's skies,                    110
    The rocky Isle that holds or held his dust,
    Shall crown the Atlantic like the Hero's bust,
    And mighty Nature o'er his obsequies
    Do more than niggard Envy still denies.
    But what are these to him? Can Glory's lust
    Touch the freed spirit or the fettered dust?
    Small care hath he of what his tomb consists;
    Nought if he sleeps--nor more if he exists:
    Alike the better-seeing Shade will smile
    On the rude cavern[275] of the rocky isle,                         120
    As if his ashes found their latest home
    In Rome's Pantheon or Gaul's mimic dome[276].
    He wants not this; but France shall feel the want
    Of this last consolation, though so scant:
    Her Honour--Fame--and Faith demand his bones,
    To rear above a Pyramid of thrones;
    Or carried onward in the battle's van,
    To form, like Guesclin's dust, her Talisman[277].
    But be it as it is--the time may come
    His name shall beat the alarm, like Ziska's drum[278].             130


                    V.

    Oh Heaven! of which he was in power a feature;
    Oh Earth! of which he was a noble creature;
    Thou Isle! to be remembered long and well,
    That saw'st the unfledged eaglet chip his shell!
    Ye Alps which viewed him in his dawning flights
    Hover, the Victor of a hundred fights!
    Thou Rome, who saw'st thy Cæsar's deeds outdone!
    Alas! why passed he too the Rubicon--
    The Rubicon of Man's awakened rights,
    To herd with vulgar kings and parasites?                           140
    Egypt! from whose all dateless tombs arose
    Forgotten Pharaohs from their long repose,
    And shook within their pyramids to hear
    A new Cambyses thundering in their ear;
    While the dark shades of Forty Ages stood
    Like startled giants by Nile's famous flood[279];
    Or from the Pyramid's tall pinnacle
    Beheld the desert peopled, as from hell,
    With clashing hosts, who strewed the barren sand,
    To re-manure the uncultivated land!                                150
    Spain! which, a moment mindless of the Cid,
    Beheld his banner flouting thy Madrid[280]!
    Austria! which saw thy twice-ta'en capital[281]
    Twice spared to be the traitress of his fall!
    Ye race of Frederic!--Frederics but in name
    And falsehood--heirs to all except his fame:
    Who, crushed at Jena, crouched at Berlin[282], fell
    First, and but rose to follow! Ye who dwell
    Where Kosciusko dwelt, remembering yet
    The unpaid amount of Catherine's bloody debt[283]!                 160
    Poland! o'er which the avenging Angel past,
    But left thee as he found thee,[284] still a waste,
    Forgetting all thy still enduring claim,
    Thy lotted people and extinguished name,
    Thy sigh for freedom, thy long-flowing tear,
    That sound that crashes in the tyrant's ear--
    Kosciusko![285] On--on--on--the thirst of War
    Gasps for the gore of serfs and of their Czar.
    The half barbaric Moscow's minarets
    Gleam in the sun, but 'tis a sun that sets!                        170
    Moscow! thou limit of his long career,
    For which rude Charles had wept his frozen tear[286]
    To see in vain--_he_ saw thee--how? with spire
    And palace fuel to one common fire.
    To this the soldier lent his kindling match,
    To this the peasant gave his cottage thatch,
    To this the merchant flung his hoarded store,
    The prince his hall--and Moscow was no more!
    Sublimest of volcanoes! Etna's flame
    Pales before thine, and quenchless Hecla's tame;                   180
    Vesuvius shows his blaze,[287] an usual sight
    For gaping tourists, from his hackneyed height:[dz]
    Thou stand'st alone unrivalled, till the Fire
    To come, in which all empires shall expire!

      Thou other Element! as strong and stern,
    To teach a lesson conquerors will not learn!--
    Whose icy wing flapped o'er the faltering foe,
    Till fell a hero with each flake of snow;
    How did thy numbing beak and silent fang,
    Pierce, till hosts perished with a single pang!                    190
    In vain shall Seine look up along his banks
    For the gay thousands of his dashing ranks!
    In vain shall France recall beneath her vines
    Her Youth--their blood flows faster than her wines;
    Or stagnant in their human ice remains
    In frozen mummies on the Polar plains.
    In vain will Italy's broad sun awaken
    Her offspring chilled; its beams are now forsaken.
    Of all the trophies gathered from the war,
    What shall return? the Conqueror's broken car![288]                200
    The Conqueror's yet unbroken heart! Again
    The horn of Roland[289] sounds, and not in vain.
    Lutzen, where fell the Swede of victory,[290]
    Beholds him conquer, but, alas! not die:
    Dresden[291] surveys three despots fly once more
    Before their sovereign,--sovereign as before;[ea]
    But there exhausted Fortune quits the field,
    And Leipsic's[292] treason bids the unvanquished yield;
    The Saxon jackal leaves the lion's side
    To turn the bear's, and wolf's, and fox's guide;                   210
    And backward to the den of his despair
    The forest monarch shrinks, but finds no lair!

      Oh ye! and each, and all! Oh France! who found
    Thy long fair fields ploughed up as hostile ground,
    Disputed foot by foot, till Treason, still
    His only victor, from Montmartre's hill[293]
    Looked down o'er trampled Paris! and thou Isle,
    Which seest Etruria from thy ramparts smile,
    Thou momentary shelter of his pride,
    Till wooed by danger, his yet weeping bride!                       220
    Oh, France! retaken by a single march,
    Whose path was through one long triumphal arch!
    Oh bloody and most bootless Waterloo!
    Which proves how fools may have their fortune too,
    Won half by blunder, half by treachery:
    Oh dull Saint Helen! with thy gaoler nigh--
    Hear! hear Prometheus[294] from his rock appeal
    To Earth,--Air,--Ocean,--all that felt or feel
    His power and glory, all who yet shall hear
    A name eternal as the rolling year;                                230
    He teaches them the lesson taught so long,
    So oft, so vainly--learn to do no wrong!
    A single step into the right had made
    This man the Washington of worlds betrayed:
    A single step into the wrong has given
    His name a doubt to all the winds of heaven;
    The reed of Fortune, and of thrones the rod,
    Of Fame the Moloch or the demigod;
    His country's Cæsar, Europe's Hannibal,
    Without their decent dignity of fall.                              240
    Yet Vanity herself had better taught
    A surer path even to the fame he sought,
    By pointing out on History's fruitless page
    Ten thousand conquerors for a single sage.
    While Franklin's quiet memory climbs to Heaven,
    Calming the lightning which he thence hath riven,
    Or drawing from the no less kindled earth
    Freedom and peace to that which boasts his birth;[295]
    While Washington's a watchword, such as ne'er
    Shall sink while there's an echo left to air:[296]                 250
    While even the Spaniard's thirst of gold and war
    Forgets Pizarro to shout Bolivar![297]
    Alas! why must the same Atlantic wave
    Which wafted freedom gird a tyrant's grave--
    The king of kings, and yet of slaves the slave,
    Who burst the chains of millions to renew
    The very fetters which his arm broke through,
    And crushed the rights of Europe and his own,
    To flit between a dungeon and a throne?


                    VI.

    But 'twill not be--the spark's awakened--lo!                       260
    The swarthy Spaniard feels his former glow;
    The same high spirit which beat back the Moor
    Through eight long ages of alternate gore
    Revives--and where? in that avenging clime
    Where Spain was once synonymous with crime,
    Where Cortes' and Pizarro's banner flew,
    The infant world redeems her name of "_New_."
    'Tis the _old_ aspiration breathed afresh,
    To kindle souls within degraded flesh,
    Such as repulsed the Persian from the shore                        270
    Where Greece _was_--No! she still is Greece once more.
    One common cause makes myriads of one breast,
    Slaves of the East, or helots of the West:
    On Andes'[298] and on Athos' peaks unfurled,
    The self-same standard streams o'er either world:
    The Athenian[299] wears again Harmodius' sword;
    The Chili chief[300] abjures his foreign lord;
    The Spartan knows himself once more a Greek,[301]
    Young Freedom plumes the crest of each cacique;
    Debating despots, hemmed on either shore,                          280
    Shrink vainly from the roused Atlantic's roar;
    Through Calpe's strait the rolling tides advance,
    Sweep slightly by the half-tamed land of France,
    Dash o'er the old Spaniard's cradle, and would fain
    Unite Ausonia to the mighty main:
    But driven from thence awhile, yet not for aye,
    Break o'er th' Ægean, mindful of the day
    Of Salamis!--there, there the waves arise,
    Not to be lulled by tyrant victories.
    Lone, lost, abandoned in their utmost need                         290
    By Christians, unto whom they gave their creed,
    The desolated lands, the ravaged isle,
    The fostered feud encouraged to beguile,
    The aid evaded, and the cold delay,
    Prolonged but in the hope to make a prey[302];--
    These, these shall tell the tale, and Greece can show
    The false friend worse than the infuriate foe.
    But this is well: Greeks only should free Greece,
    Not the barbarian, with his masque of peace.
    How should the Autocrat of bondage be                              300
    The king of serfs, and set the nations free?
    Better still serve the haughty Mussulman,
    Than swell the Cossaque's prowling caravan;
    Better still toil for masters, than await,
    The slave of slaves, before a Russian gate,--
    Numbered by hordes, a human capital,
    A live estate, existing but for thrall,
    Lotted by thousands, as a meet reward
    For the first courtier in the Czar's regard;
    While their immediate owner never tastes                           310
    His sleep, _sans_ dreaming of Siberia's wastes:
    Better succumb even to their own despair,
    And drive the Camel--than purvey the Bear.


                    VII.

    But not alone within the hoariest clime
    Where Freedom dates her birth with that of Time,
    And not alone where, plunged in night, a crowd
    Of Incas darken to a dubious cloud[eb],
    The dawn revives: renowned, romantic Spain
    Holds back the invader from her soil again.
    Not now the Roman tribe nor Punic horde[ec]                        320
    Demands her fields as lists to prove the sword;
    Not now the Vandal or the Visigoth
    Pollute the plains, alike abhorring both[ed];
    Nor old Pelayo[303] on his mountain rears
    The warlike fathers of a thousand years.
    That seed is sown and reaped, as oft the Moor
    Sighs to remember on his dusky shore.
    Long in the peasant's song or poet's page
    Has dwelt the memory of Abencerrage;
    The Zegri[304], and the captive victors, flung                     330
    Back to the barbarous realm from whence they sprung.
    But these are gone--their faith, their swords, their sway,
    Yet left more anti-christian foes than they[ee];
    The bigot monarch, and the butcher priest[305],
    The Inquisition, with her burning feast,
    The Faith's red "Auto," fed with human fuel,
    While sate the catholic Moloch, calmly cruel,
    Enjoying, with inexorable eye,[ef]
    That fiery festival of Agony!
    The stern or feeble sovereign, one or both                         340
    By turns; the haughtiness whose pride was sloth;
    The long degenerate noble; the debased
    Hidalgo, and the peasant less disgraced,
    But more degraded; the unpeopled realm;
    The once proud navy which forgot the helm;
    The once impervious phalanx disarrayed;
    The idle forge that formed Toledo's blade;
    The foreign wealth that flowed on every shore,
    Save hers who earned it with the native's gore;
    The very language which might vie with Rome's,                     350
    And once was known to nations like their homes,
    Neglected or forgotten:--such _was_ Spain;
    But such she is not, nor shall be again.
    These worst, these _home_ invaders, felt and feel
    The new Numantine soul of old Castile[eg],
    Up! up again! undaunted Tauridor!
    The bull of Phalaris renews his roar[eh];
    Mount, chivalrous Hidalgo! not in vain
    Revive the cry--"Iago! and close Spain!"[306]
    Yes, close her with your arméd bosoms round,                       360
    And form the barrier which Napoleon found,--
    The exterminating war, the desert plain,
    The streets without a tenant, save the slain;
    The wild Sierra, with its wilder troop[ei]
    Of vulture-plumed Guerrillas, on the stoop[ej]
    For their incessant prey; the desperate wall
    Of Saragossa, mightiest in her fall;
    The Man nerved to a spirit, and the Maid
    Waving her more than Amazonian blade[307];
    The knife of Arragon, Toledo's steel;                              370
    The famous lance of chivalrous Castile[308];
    The unerring rifle of the Catalan;
    The Andalusian courser in the van;
    The torch to make a Moscow of Madrid;
    And in each heart the spirit of the Cid:--
    Such have been, such shall be, such are. Advance,
    And win--not Spain! but thine own freedom, France!


                    VIII.

    But lo! a Congress[309]! What! that hallowed name
    Which freed the Atlantic! May we hope the same
    For outworn Europe? With the sound arise,                          380
    Like Samuel's shade to Saul's monarchic eyes,
    The prophets of young Freedom, summoned far
    From climes of Washington and Bolivar;
    Henry, the forest-born Demosthenes,
    Whose thunder shook the Philip of the seas[310];
    And stoic Franklin's energetic shade,
    Robed in the lightnings which his hand allayed;
    And Washington, the tyrant-tamer, wake,
    To bid us blush for these old chains, or break.
    But _who_ compose this Senate of the few                           390
    That should redeem the many? _Who_ renew
    This consecrated name, till now assigned
    To councils held to benefit mankind?
    Who now assemble at the holy call?
    The blest Alliance, which says three are all!
    An earthly Trinity! which wears the shape
    Of Heaven's, as man is mimicked by the ape.
    A pious Unity! in purpose one--
    To melt three fools to a Napoleon[ek].
    Why, Egypt's Gods were rational to these;                          400
    Their dogs and oxen knew their own degrees,
    And, quiet in their kennel or their shed,
    Cared little, so that they were duly fed;
    But these, more hungry, must have something more--
    The power to bark and bite, to toss and gore.
    Ah, how much happier were good Æsop's frogs
    Than we! for ours are animated logs,
    With ponderous malice swaying to and fro,
    And crushing nations with a stupid blow;
    All dully anxious to leave little work                             410
    Unto the revolutionary stork.


                    IX.

    Thrice blest Verona! since the holy three
    With their imperial presence shine on thee!
    Honoured by them, thy treacherous site forgets[el]
    The vaunted tomb of "all the Capulets!"[311]
    Thy Scaligers--for what was "Dog the Great,"
    "Can Grande,"[312] (which I venture to translate,)
    To these sublimer pugs? Thy poet too,
    Catullus, whose old laurels yield to new;[313]
    Thine amphitheatre, where Romans sate;                             420
    And Dante's exile sheltered by thy gate;
    Thy good old man, whose world was all within
    Thy wall, nor knew the country held him in;[314]
    Would that the royal guests it girds about
    Were so far like, as never to get out!
    Aye, shout! inscribe![315] rear monuments of shame,
    To tell Oppression that the world is tame!
    Crowd to the theatre with loyal rage,
    The comedy is not upon the stage;
    The show is rich in ribandry and stars,                            430
    Then gaze upon it through thy dungeon bars;
    Clap thy permitted palms, kind Italy,
    For thus much still thy fettered hands are free!


                    X.

    Resplendent sight! Behold the coxcomb Czar,[316]
    The Autocrat of waltzes[317] and of war!
    As eager for a plaudit as a realm,
    And just as fit for flirting as the helm;
    A Calmuck beauty with a Cossack wit,
    And generous spirit, when 'tis not frost-bit;
    Now half dissolving to a liberal thaw,[em]                         440
    But hardened back whene'er the morning's raw;
    With no objection to true Liberty,
    Except that it would make the nations free.
    How well the imperial dandy prates of peace!
    How fain, if Greeks would be his slaves, free Greece!
    How nobly gave he back the Poles their Diet,
    Then told pugnacious Poland to be quiet!
    How kindly would he send the mild Ukraine,
    With all her pleasant Pulks,[318] to lecture Spain!
    How royally show off in proud Madrid                               450
    His goodly person, from the South long hid!
    A blessing cheaply purchased, the world knows,
    By having Muscovites for friends or foes.
    Proceed, thou namesake of great Philip's son!
    La Harpe, thine Aristotle, beckons on;[319]
    And that which Scythia was to him of yore
    Find with thy Scythians on Iberia's shore.
    Yet think upon, thou somewhat agéd youth,
    Thy predecessor on the banks of Pruth;
    Thou hast to aid thee, should his lot be thine,                    460
    Many an old woman,[320] but not Catherine.[321]
    Spain, too, hath rocks, and rivers, and defiles--
    The Bear may rush into the Lion's toils.
    Fatal to Goths are Xeres' sunny fields;[322]
    Think'st thou to thee Napoleon's victor yields?
    Better reclaim thy deserts, turn thy swords
    To ploughshares, shave and wash thy Bashkir[323] hordes,
    Redeem thy realms from slavery and the knout,
    Than follow headlong in the fatal route,
    To infest the clime whose skies and laws are pure                  470
    With thy foul legions. Spain wants no manure:
    Her soil is fertile, but she feeds no foe:
    Her vultures, too, were gorged not long ago;
    And wouldst thou furnish them with fresher prey?
    Alas! thou wilt not conquer, but purvey.
    I am Diogenes, though Russ and Hun[324]
    Stand between mine and many a myriad's sun;
    But were I not Diogenes, I'd wander
    Rather a worm than _such_ an Alexander!
    Be slaves who will, the cynic shall be free;                       480
    His tub hath tougher walls than Sinopè:[en]
    Still will he hold his lantern up to scan
    The face of monarchs for an "honest man."[325]


                    XI.

    And what doth Gaul, the all-prolific land
    Of _ne plus ultra_ ultras and their band
    Of mercenaries? and her noisy chambers
    And tribune, which each orator first clambers
    Before he finds a voice, and when 'tis found,
    Hears "the lie" echo for his answer round?
    Our British Commons sometimes deign to "hear!" 490
    A Gallic senate hath more tongue than ear;
    Even Constant,[326] their sole master of debate,
    Must fight next day his speech to vindicate.
    But this costs little to true Franks, who'd rather
    Combat than listen, were it to their father.
    What is the simple standing of a shot,
    To listening long, and interrupting not?
    Though this was not the method of old Rome,
    When Tully fulmined o'er each vocal dome,
    Demosthenes has sanctioned the transaction,                        500
    In saying eloquence meant "Action, action!"


                    XII.

    But where's the monarch?[327] hath he dined? or yet
    Groans beneath indigestion's heavy debt?
    Have revolutionary patés risen,
    And turned the royal entrails to a prison?
    Have discontented movements stirred the troops?
    Or have _no_ movements followed traitorous soups?
    Have Carbonaro[328] cooks not carbonadoed
    Each course enough? or doctors dire dissuaded
    Repletion? Ah! in thy dejected looks                               510
    I read all France's treason in her cooks!
    Good classic Louis! is it, canst thou say,
    Desirable to be the "Desiré?"
    Why wouldst thou leave calm Hartwell's green abode,
    Apician table, and Horatian ode,
    To rule a people who will not be ruled,
    And love much rather to be scourged than schooled?
    Ah! thine was not the temper or the taste
    For thrones; the table sees thee better placed:
    A mild Epicurean, formed, at best,                                 520
    To be a kind host and as good a guest,
    To talk of Letters, and to know by heart
    One _half_ the Poet's, _all_ the Gourmand's art;
    A scholar always, now and then a wit,
    And gentle when Digestion may permit;--
    But not to govern lands enslaved or free;
    The gout was martyrdom enough for thee.


                    XIII.

    Shall noble Albion pass without a phrase
    From a bold Briton in her wonted praise?
    "Arts--arms--and George--and glory--and the Isles, 530
    And happy Britain, wealth, and Freedom's smiles,
    White cliffs, that held invasion far aloof,
    Contented subjects, all alike tax-proof,
    Proud Wellington, with eagle beak so curled,[eo]
    That nose, the hook where he suspends the world![329]
    And Waterloo, and trade, and----(hush! not yet
    A syllable of imposts or of debt)----
    And ne'er (enough) lamented Castlereagh,[330]
    Whose penknife slit a goose-quill t'other day--[ep]
    And, 'pilots who have weathered every storm'--[331]                540
    (But, no, not even for rhyme's sake, name Reform)."
    These are the themes thus sung so oft before,
    Methinks we need not sing them any more;
    Found in so many volumes far and near,
    There's no occasion you should find them here.
    Yet something may remain perchance to chime
    With reason, and, what's stranger still, with rhyme.[eq]
    Even this thy genius, Canning![332] may permit,
    Who, bred a statesman, still wast born a wit,
    And never, even in that dull House, couldst tame                   550
    To unleavened prose thine own poetic flame;
    Our last, our best, our only orator,
    Even I can praise thee--Tories do no more:
    Nay, not so much;--they hate thee, man, because
    Thy Spirit less upholds them than it awes.
    The hounds will gather to their huntsman's hollo,
    And where he leads the duteous pack will follow;
    But not for love mistake their yelling cry;
    Their yelp for game is not an eulogy;
    Less faithful far than the four-footed pack,                       560
    A dubious scent would lure the bipeds back.
    Thy saddle-girths are not yet quite secure,
    Nor royal stallion's feet extremely sure;
    The unwieldy old white horse is apt at last
    To stumble, kick--and now and then stick fast
    With his great Self and Rider in the mud;
    But what of that? the animal shows blood.


                    XIV.

    Alas, the Country! how shall tongue or pen
    Bewail her now _un_country gentlemen?
    The last to bid the cry of warfare cease,                          570
    The first to make a malady of peace.
    For what were all these country patriots born?
    To hunt--and vote--and raise the price of corn?
    But corn, like every mortal thing, must fall,
    Kings--Conquerors--and markets most of all.
    And must ye fall with every ear of grain?
    Why would you trouble Buonaparté's reign?
    He was your great Triptolemus;[333] his vices
    Destroyed but realms, and still maintained your prices;
    He amplified to every lord's content                               580
    The grand agrarian alchymy, high _rent_.[er]
    Why did the tyrant stumble on the Tartars,
    And lower wheat to such desponding quarters?
    Why did you chain him on yon Isle so lone?
    The man was worth much more upon his throne.
    True, blood and treasure boundlessly were spilt,
    But what of that? the Gaul may bear the guilt;
    But bread was high, the farmer paid his way,
    And acres told upon the appointed day.[es]
    But where is now the goodly audit ale?                             590
    The purse-proud tenant, never known to fail?
    The farm which never yet was left on hand?
    The marsh reclaimed to most improving land?
    The impatient hope of the expiring lease?
    The doubling rental? What an evil's peace!
    In vain the prize excites the ploughman's skill,
    In vain the Commons pass their patriot bill;[334]
    The _Landed Interest_--(you may understand
    The phrase much better leaving out the _land_)--
    The land self-interest groans from shore to shore,                 600
    For fear that plenty should attain the poor.[et]
    Up, up again, ye rents, exalt your notes,
    Or else the Ministry will lose their votes,
    And patriotism, so delicately nice,
    Her loaves will lower to the market price;[eu]
    For ah! "the loaves and fishes," once so high,
    Are gone--their oven closed, their ocean dry,[ev]
    And nought remains of all the millions spent,
    Excepting to grow moderate and content.
    They who are not so, _had_ their turn--and turn                    610
    About still flows from Fortune's equal urn;
    Now let their virtue be its own reward,
    And share the blessings which themselves prepared.
    See these inglorious Cincinnati swarm,
    Farmers of war, dictators of the farm;
    _Their_ ploughshare was the sword in hireling hands,
    _Their_ fields manured by gore of other lands;
    Safe in their barns, these Sabine tillers sent
    Their brethren out to battle--why? for rent!
    Year after year they voted cent. per cent.                         620
    Blood, sweat, and tear-wrung millions--why?--for rent!
    They roared, they dined, they drank, they swore they meant
    To die for England--why then live?--for rent!
    The peace has made one general malcontent
    Of these high-market patriots; war was rent!
    Their love of country, millions all mis-spent,
    How reconcile? by reconciling rent!
    And will they not repay the treasures lent?
    No: down with everything, and up with rent!
    Their good, ill, health, wealth, joy, or discontent,               630
    Being, end, aim, religion--_rent_--_rent_--_rent_!
    Thou sold'st thy birthright, Esau! for a mess;
    Thou shouldst have gotten more, or eaten less;
    Now thou hast swilled thy pottage, thy demands
    Are idle; Israel says the bargain stands.
    Such, landlords! was your appetite for war,
    And gorged with blood, you grumble at a scar!
    What! would they spread their earthquake even o'er cash?
    And when land crumbles, bid firm paper crash?[335]
    So rent may rise, bid Bank and Nation fall,                        640
    And found on 'Change a _Fundling_ Hospital?
    Lo, Mother Church, while all religion writhes,
    Like Niobe, weeps o'er her offspring--Tithes;[336]
    The Prelates go to--where the Saints have gone,
    And proud pluralities subside to one;
    Church, state, and faction wrestle in the dark,
    Tossed by the deluge in their common ark.
    Shorn of her bishops, banks, and dividends,
    Another Babel soars--but Britain ends.
    And why? to pamper the self-seeking wants,                         650
    And prop the hill of these agrarian ants.
    "Go to these ants, thou sluggard, and be wise;"
    Admire their patience through each sacrifice,
    Till taught to feel the lesson of their pride,
    The price of taxes and of homicide;
    Admire their justice, which would fain deny
    The debt of nations:--pray _who made it high?_[337]



                    XV.

    Or turn to sail between those shifting rocks,
    The new Symplegades[338]--the crushing Stocks,
    Where Midas might again his wish behold                            660
    In real paper or imagined gold.
    That magic palace of Alcina[339] shows
    More wealth than Britain ever had to lose,
    Were all her atoms of unleavened ore,
    And all her pebbles from Pactolus' shore.
    There Fortune plays, while Rumour holds the stake
    And the World trembles to bid brokers break.
    How rich is Britain! not indeed in mines,
    Or peace or plenty, corn or oil, or wines;
    No land of Canaan, full of milk and honey,                         670
    Nor (save in paper shekels) ready money:
    But let us not to own the truth refuse,
    Was ever Christian land so rich in Jews?
    Those parted with their teeth to good King John,
    And now, ye kings, they kindly draw your own;
    All states, all things, all sovereigns they control,
    And waft a loan "from Indus to the pole."
    The banker--broker--baron[340]--brethren, speed
    To aid these bankrupt tyrants in their need.
    Nor these alone; Columbia feels no less                            680
    Fresh speculations follow each success;
    And philanthropic Israel deigns to drain
    Her mild per-centage from exhausted Spain.
    Not without Abraham's seed can Russia march;
    Tis gold, not steel, that rears the conqueror's arch.
    Two Jews, a chosen people, can command
    In every realm their Scripture-promised land:--
    Two Jews, keep down the Romans,[341] and uphold
    The accurséd Hun, more brutal than of old:
    Two Jews,--but not Samaritans--direct                              690
    The world, with all the spirit of their sect.
    What is the happiness of earth to them?
    A congress forms their "New Jerusalem,"
    Where baronies and orders both invite--
    Oh, holy Abraham! dost thou see the sight?
    Thy followers mingling with these royal swine,
    Who spit not "on their Jewish gaberdine,"
    But honour them as portion of the show--
    (Where now, oh Pope! is thy forsaken toe?
    Could it not favour Judah with some kicks?                         700
    Or has it ceased to "kick against the pricks?")
    On Shylock's shore behold them stand afresh,
    To cut from Nation's hearts their "pound of flesh."


                    XVI.

    Strange sight this Congress! destined to unite
    All that's incongruous, all that's opposite.
    I speak not of the Sovereigns--they're alike,
    A common coin as ever mint could strike;
    But those who sway the puppets, pull the strings,
    Have more of motley than their heavy kings.
    Jews, authors, generals, charlatans, combine,                      710
    While Europe wonders at the vast design:
    There Metternich, power's foremost parasite,
    Cajoles; there Wellington forgets to fight;
    There Chateaubriand[342] forms new books of martyrs;
    And subtle Greeks[343] intrigue for stupid Tartars;
    There Montmorenci, the sworn foe to charters,[344]
    Turns a diplomatist of great éclat,
    To furnish articles for the "Débats;"
    Of war so certain--yet not quite so sure
    As his dismissal in the "Moniteur." 720
    Alas! how could his cabinet thus err!
    Can Peace be worth an ultra-minister?
    He falls indeed, perhaps to rise again,
    "Almost as quickly as he conquered Spain.[345]"


                    XVII.

    Enough of this--a sight more mournful woos
    The averted eye of the reluctant Muse.
    The Imperial daughter, the Imperial bride,[346]
    The imperial Victim--sacrifice to pride;
    The mother of the Hero's hope, the boy,
    The young Astyanax of Modern Troy;[347]                            730
    The still pale shadow of the loftiest Queen
    That Earth has yet to see, or e'er hath seen;
    She flits amidst the phantoms of the hour,
    The theme of pity, and the wreck of power.
    Oh, cruel mockery! Could not Austria spare
    A daughter? What did France's widow there?
    Her fitter place was by St. Helen's wave,
    Her only throne is in Napoleon's grave.
    But, no,--she still must hold a petty reign,
    Flanked by her formidable chamberlain;                             740
    The martial Argus, whose not hundred eyes[348]
    Must watch her through these paltry pageantries.
    What though she share no more, and shared in vain,
    A sway surpassing that of Charlemagne,
    Which swept from Moscow to the southern seas!
    Yet still she rules the pastoral realm of cheese,
    Where Parma views the traveller resort,
    To note the trappings of her mimic court.
    But she appears! Verona sees her shorn
    Of all her beams--while nations gaze and mourn--                   750
    Ere yet her husband's ashes have had time
    To chill in their inhospitable clime;
    (If e'er those awful ashes can grow cold;--
    But no,--their embers soon will burst the mould;)
    She comes!--the Andromache (but not Racine's,
    Nor Homer's,)--Lo! on Pyrrhus' arm[349] she leans![ew]
    Yes! the right arm, yet red from Waterloo,

[258] [According to Strabo (_Rerum Geog._, xvii. ed. 1807, ii. 1127),
Ptolemæus Soter brought Alexander's body back from Babylon, and buried
it in Alexandria, in the spot afterwards known as the _Soma_. There it
lay, in Strabo's time, not in its original body-mask of golden
chase-work, which Ptolemæus Cocces had stolen, but in a casket of
glass. Great men "turned to pilgrims" to visit Alexander's grave.
Augustus crowned the still life-like body with a golden laurel-wreath,
and scattered flowers over the tomb: Caligula stole the breastplate, and
wore it during his pantomimic triumphs; Septimius Severus buried in the
sarcophagus the writings of the priests, and a clue to the
hieroglyphics. Finally, the sarcophagus and its sacred remains
disappear, and Alexander himself passes into the land of fable and
romance. In 1801 a sarcophagus came into the possession of the English
Army, and was presented by George III. to the British Museum.
Hieroglyphics were as yet undeciphered, and, in 1805, the traveller
Edward Daniel Clarke published a quarto monograph (_The Tomb of
Alexander, etc._), in which he proves, to his own satisfaction, that
"this surprising sarcophagus in one entire block of green Egyptian
_breccia_," had once contained the ashes of Alexander the Great. Byron
knew Clarke, and, no doubt, respected his authority (see letter December
15, 1813, _Letters_, 1898, ii. 308); and, hence, the description of
"Alexander's urn" as "a show." The sarcophagus which has, since 1844,
been assigned to its rightful occupant, Nectanebus II. (Nekht-neb-f), is
a conspicuous object in the Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum. It
is a curious coincidence that in the Ethiopic version of the
Pseudo-Callisthenes, Alexander is said to have been the son of
Nectanebus II., who threw a spell over Olympias, the wife of Philip of
Macedon, and won her love by the exercise of nefarious magic. (See the
_Life and Exploits of Alexander the Great_, by E. A. Wallis Budge,
Litt.D., F.S.A., Keeper of the Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the
British Museum, 1896, i, ix.)]

[259] {543}[Arrian (_Alexand. Anabasis_, vii. i, 4, ed. 1849, p. 165)
says that Alexander would never have rested content with what he had
acquired; "that if he had annexed Europe to Asia, and the British Isles
to Europe, he would have sought out some no-man's-land to conquer." So
insatiable was his ambition, that when the courtly philosopher
Anaxarchus explained to him the theory of the plurality of worlds he
bemoaned himself because as yet he was not master of one. "_Heu me_,
inquit, _miserum, quod ne uno quidem adhuc potitus sum_."--Valerius
Maximus, _De Dictis, etc._, lib. viii. cap. xiv. ex. 2. See, too,
_Juvenal_, x. 168, 169. Burton (_Anatomy of Melancholy_, 1893, i. 64)
denies that this was spoken like a prince, but, as wise Seneca censures
him [on another occasion, however], 'twas _vox iniquissima et
stultissima_, "'twas spoken like a bedlam fool."]

[261] {544}[In a speech delivered in the House of Commons, February 17,
1800, "On the continuance of the War with France," Pitt described
Napoleon as the "child and champion of Jacobinism." Coleridge, who was
reporting for the _Morning Post_, took down Pitt's words as "nursling
and champion" (unpublished MS. note-book)--a finer and more original
phrase, but substituted "child" for "nursling" in his "copy." (See
_Letters of S. T. Coleridge_, 1895, i. 327, note i.) The phrase was
much in vogue, _e.g._ "All that survives of Jacobinism in Europe looks
up to him as its 'child and champion.'"-_Quarterly Review_, xvi. 48.]

[262] [O'Meara, under the dates August 19, September 5, September 7, 13,
etc. (see _Napoleon in Exile_, 1888, i. 95, 96, 114, 121, etc.), reports
complaints on the part of Napoleon with regard to the reduction of
expenses suggested or enforced by Sir Hudson Lowe, and gives specimens
of the nature and detail of these reductions. For a refutation of
O'Meara's facts and figures (as given in _Napoleon in Exile_, 1822, ii.
Appendix V.), see the _History of the Captivity of Napoleon_, by William
Forsyth, Q.C., 1853, iii. 121, _sq_.; see, too, _Sir Hudson Lowe and
Napoleon_, by R. C. Seaton, 1898. It is a fact that Sir Hudson Lowe, on
his own responsibility, increased the allowance for the household
expenses of Napoleon and his staff from £8000 to £12,000 a year, and it
is also perfectly true that opportunities for complaint were welcomed by
the ex-Emperor and his mimic court. It was _la politique de Longwood_ to
make the worst of everything, on the off-chance that England would get
to hear, and that Radical indignation and Radical sympathy would gild,
perhaps unbar, the eagle's cage. It is true, too, that a large sum of
money was spent on behalf of a prisoner of war whom the stalwarts of the
Tory party would have executed in cold blood. But it is also true that
Napoleon had no need to manufacture complaints, that he was exposed to
unnecessary discomforts, that useless and irritating precautions were
taken to prevent his escape, that the bottles of champagne and madeira,
the fowls and the bundles of wood were counted with an irritating
preciseness, inconsistent with the general scale of expenditure, which
saved a little waste, and covered both principals and agents with
ridicule. It is said that O'Meara, in his published volumes, manipulated
his evidence, and that his own letters give him the lie; but there is a
mass of correspondence, published and unpublished, between him and Sir
Thomas Reade, Sir Hudson Lowe, and Major Gorrequer (see Addit. MSS.
Brit. Mus. 20,145), which remains as it was written, and which testifies
to facts which might have been and were not refuted on the spot and at
the moment. With regard to "disputed rations," the Governor should have
been armed with a crushing answer to any and every complaint. As it was,
he was able to show that champagne was allowed to "Napoleon Buonaparte,"
and that he did not exceed his allowance.]

[263] {545}[In his correspondence with Lord Bathurst, Sir Hudson Lowe
more than once quotes "statements" made by Dr. O'Meara (_vide post_, p.
546). But the surgeon may be William Warden (1777-1849), whose _Letters
written on board His Majesty's Ship the Northumberland, and at St,
Helena_, were published in 1816.]

[264] [Henry, Earl of Bathurst (1762-1834), Secretary for War and the
Colonies, replied to Lord Holland's motion "for papers connected with
the personal treatment of Napoleon Buonaparte at St. Helena," March 18,
1817. _Parl. Deb._, vol. 35, pp. 1137-1166.]

[265] [A bust of Napoleon's son, the Duke of Reichstadt, had been
forwarded to St. Helena. O'Meara (_Napoleon in Exile, etc._, 1822, i. p.
100) says "that it had been in the island fourteen days, during several
of which it was at Plantation House," before it was transferred to
Longwood. Forsyth (_History of Napoleon in Captivity_, 1853, ii. 146)
denies this statement. It was, no doubt, detained on board ship for
inspection, but not at Plantation House.]

[266] [The book in question was _The Substance of some Letters written
by an Englishman in Paris_, 1816 (by J. C. Hobhouse). It was inscribed
"To the Emperor Napoleon." Lowe's excuse was that Hobhouse had submitted
the work to his inspection, and suggested that if the Governor did not
think fit to give it to Napoleon, he might place it in his own library.
(See _Napoleon in Exile_, 1822, i. 85-87; and Forsyth, 1853, i. 193.)]

[267] [Lieutenant-General Sir Hudson Lowe, K.C.B. (1769-1844), was the
son of an army surgeon, John Hudson Lowe. His mother was Irish. He was
appointed Governor of St. Helena, August 23, 1815, and landed in the
island April 14, 1816. Byron met him at Lord Holland's, before he sailed
for St. Helena, and was not impressed by his remarks on Napoleon and
Waterloo (_Letters_, 1901, v. 429). He was well-intentioned, honourable,
and, in essentials, humane, but he was arrogant and tactless. The
following sentence, from a letter written by Lowe to O'Meara, October 3,
1816 (Forsyth, i. 318, 319), is characteristic: "With respect to the
instructions I have received, and my manner of making them known, never
having regarded General Bonaparte's opinions in any point whatever as to
_matter_ or _manner_, as an oracle or criterion by which to regulate my
own judgment, I am not disposed to think the less favourably of the
instructions, or my mode of executing them." It must, however, be borne
in mind that this was written some time after Lowe's fifth and last
interview with his captive (Aug. 18, 1816); that Napoleon had abused him
to his face and behind his back, and was not above resorting to paltry
subterfuges in order to defy and exasperate his "paltry gaoler."]

[268] {546}[There is reason to think that "the staring stranger" was the
traveller Captain Basil Hall (1788-1844), who called upon Byron at
Venice (see _Letters_, 1900, iv. 252), but did not see him. His account
of his interview with Napoleon is attached to his narrative of a _Voyage
to Java_, 1840. It is not included in the earlier editions of Hall's
_Voyage to the Corea and the Loochoo Islands_, but is quoted by Scott,
in his _Life of Napoleon_, 1827.]

[269] [Barry Edward O'Meara (1786-1836) began life as assistant-surgeon
to the 62nd Regiment, then stationed in Sicily and Calabria. In 1815 he
was surgeon on board the _Bellerophon_, under Captain F. L. Maitland.
Napoleon took a fancy to him because he could speak Italian, and, as his
own surgeon Mengeaud would not follow him into exile, requested that
O'Meara might accompany him, in the _Northumberland_, to St. Helena. His
position was an ambiguous one. He was to act as Napoleon's medical and,
_quoad hoc_, confidential attendant, but he was not to be subservient to
him or dependent on him. At St. Helena Lowe expected him to be something
between an intermediary and a spy, and, for a time, O'Meara discharged
both functions to the Governor's satisfaction (statements by Dr. O'Meara
are quoted by Lowe in his letter to Lord Bathurst [_Life of Napoleon,
etc._, by Sir W. Scott, 1828, p. 763]). As time went on, the surgeon
yielded to the glamour of Napoleon's influence, and more and more
disliked and resented the necessity of communicating private
conversations to Lowe. He "withheld his confidence," with the result
that the Governor became suspicious, and treated O'Meara with
reprobation and contempt. At length, on July 18, 1818, on a renewed
accusation of "irregularities," Lord Bathurst dismissed him from his
post, and ordered him to quit St. Helena. He returned to England, and,
October 28, 1818, addressed a letter (see Forsyth's _Napoleon, etc._,
iii. 432, 433) to J. W. Croker, the Secretary to the Admiralty, in which
he argued against the justice of his dismissal. One sentence which
asserted that Lowe had dwelt upon the "benefit which would result to
Europe from the death of Napoleon," was seized upon by Croker as
calumnious, and in answer to his remonstrance, O'Meara's name was struck
off the list of naval surgeons. He published, in 1819, a work entitled
_Exposition of some of the Transactions that have taken place at St.
Helena since the appointment of Sir Hudson Lowe as Governor_, which was
afterwards expanded into _Napoleon in Exile, or a Voice from St. Helena_
(2 vols., 1822). The latter work made a great sensation, and passed
through five editions. It was republished in 1888. O'Meara was able, and
generously disposed, but he was not "stiff" (_vide infra_, 489). "He
was," says Lord Rosebery (_Napoleon, The Last Phase_, 1900, p. 31), "the
confidential servant of Napoleon: unknown to Napoleon, he was the
confidential agent of Lowe; and behind both their backs he was the
confidential informant of the British Government.... Testimony from such
a source is ... tainted." Neither men nor angels will disentangle the
wheat from the tares.]

[270] {547}[Buonaparte died the 5th of May, 1821.]

[271] [At the end of vol. ii. of O'Meara's _Voice, etc._ (ed. 5), there
is a statement, signed by Count Montholon, to the effect that he wished
the following inscription to be placed on Napoleon's coffin--

              "Napoléon.

      Né à Ajaccio le 15 Août, 1769,
    Mort à Ste. Hélène le 5 Mai, 1821;"

but that the Governor said, "that his instructions would not allow him
to sanction any other name being placed on the coffin than that of
'General Bonaparte.'" Lowe would have sanctioned "Napoléon Bonaparte,"
but, on his own admission, _did_ refuse the inscription of the one word
"Napoléon."--Forsyth, iii. 295, 296, note 3.]

[272] {548}[Hall, in his interview with Napoleon at St. Helena,
_Narrative of a Voyage to Java_, 1840, p. 77, testifies that, weeks
before the vessel anchored at St. Helena, August 11, 1817, "the
probability of seeing him [Napoleon] had engrossed the thoughts of every
one on board.... Even those of our number who, from their situation,
could have no chance of seeing him, caught the fever of the moment, and
the most cold and indifferent person on board was roused on the occasion
into unexpected excitement."]

Austerlitz, was inaugurated in 1810.]

[274] [Pompey's, i.e. Diocletian's Pillar stands on a mound near the
Arabian cemetery, about three quarters of a mile from Alexandria,
between the city and Lake Mareotis.]

[275] [Napoleon was buried, May 9, 1821, in a garden in the middle of a
deep ravine, under the shade of two willow trees.]

[276] [Byron took for granted that Napoleon's remains would one day rest
under the dome of the Pantheon, where Mirabeau is buried, and where
cenotaphs have been erected to Voltaire and Rousseau. As it is (since
December 15, 1840) he sleeps under the Dôme des Invalides. Above the
entrance are these words, which are taken from his will: "Je désire que
mes cendres reposent sur les bords de la Seine, au milieu de ce peuple
Français que j'ai tant aimé."]

[277] {549} Guesclin died during the siege of a city; it surrendered,
and the keys were brought and laid upon his bier, so that the place
might appear rendered to his ashes. [Bertrand du Guesclin, born 1320,
first distinguished himself in the service of King John II. of France,
in defending Rennes against Henry Duke of Lancaster, 1356-57. He was
made Constable of France in 1370, and died before the walls of
Châteauneuf-de-Randon (Lozère). July 13, 1380. He was buried by the
order of Charles V. in Saint-Denis, hard by the tomb which the king had
built for himself. In _La Vie vaillant Bertran du Guesclin_ [_Chronique,
etc._ (par E. Charrière), 1839, tom. ii. p. 321, lines 22716, _sq._],
the English do not place the keys of the castle on Du Guesclin's bier,
but present them to him as he lies tossing on his death-bed ("à son lit
agité"). So, too, _Histoire de Messire Bertrand du Guesclin_, par Claude
Menard, 1618, 540: "Et Engloiz se accorderent à ce faire. Lors issirent
dudit Chastel, et vindrent à Bertran, et lui presenterent les clefs. Et
ne demora guères, qu'il getta le souppir de la mort."]

[278] [John of Trocnow, surnamed Zižka, or the "One-eyed," was born
circ. 1360, and died while he was besieging a town on the Moravian
border, October 11, 1424. He was the hero of the Hussite or Taborite
crusade (1419-1422), the _malleus Catholicorum_. The story is that on
his death-bed he was asked where he wished to be buried, and replied,
"that it mattered not, that his flesh might be thrown to the vulture and
eagles; but his skin was to be carefully preserved and made into a drum,
to be carried in the front of the battle, that the very sound might
disperse their enemies." Voltaire, in his _Essai sur Les Mœurs et
L'Esprit des Nations_ (cap. lxxiii. s.f. _Œuvres Complètes, etc._,
1836, iii. 256), mentions the legend as a fact, "Il ordonna qu' après sa
mort on fit un tambour de sa peau." Compare _Werner_, act i. sc. I,

evacuated January 12, 1806, captured by Napoleon, May, 1809, and
restored at the conclusion of peace, October 14, 1809. Her treachery
consisted in her hospitality to the sovereigns at the Congress of
Vienna, November, 1814, and her share in the Treaty of Vienna, March 25,
1815, which ratified the Treaties of Chaumont, March 1, and of Paris,
April 11, 1814.]

[282] [At Jena Napoleon defeated Prince Hohenlohe, and at Auerstadt
General Davoust defeated the King of Prussia, October 14, 1806. Napoleon
then advanced to Berlin, October 27, from which he issued his famous
decree against British commerce, November 20, 1806.]

[283] [The partition of Poland. "Henry [of Prussia] arrived at St.
Petersburg, December 9, 1770; and it seems now to be certain that the
first open proposal of a dismemberment of Poland arose in his
conversations with the Empress.... Catherine said to the Prince, 'I will
frighten Turkey and flatter England. It is your business to gain
Austria, that she may lull France to sleep;' and she became at length so
eager, that ... she dipt her finger into ink, and drew with it the lines
of partition on a map of Poland which lay before them."--_Edinburgh
Review_, November, 1822 (art. x. on _Histoire des Trois Démembremens de
la Pologne_, par M. Ferrand, 1820, etc., vol. 37, pp. 479, 480.)]

[284] {551} [Napoleon promised much, but did little for the Poles. "In
speaking of the business of Poland he ... said it was a whim (_c'était
un caprice_)."--_Narrative of an Embassy to Warsaw_, by M. Dufour de
Pradt, 1816, p. 51. "The Polish question," says Lord Wolseley (_Decline
and Fall of Napoleon_, 1893, p. 19), "thrust itself most inconveniently
before him. In early life all his sympathies ... were with the Poles,
and he had regarded the partition of their country as a crime.... As a
very young man liberty was his only religion; but he had now learned to
hate and to fear that term.... He had no desire ... to be the Don
Quixote of Poland by reconstituting it as a kingdom. To fight Russia by
the re-establishment of Polish independence was not, therefore, to be
thought of."]

[285] [The final partition of Poland took place after the Battle of
Maciejowice, October 12, 1794, when "Freedom shrieked when Kosciusko
fell." Tyrants, _e.g._ Napoleon in 1806, and Alexander in 1814 and again
in 1815, approached Kosciusko with respect, and loaded him with flattery
and promises, and then "passed by on the other side."]

[286] [The reference is to Charles's chagrin when the Grand Vizier
allowed the Russians to retire in safety from the banks of the Pruth,
and assented to the Treaty of Jassy, July 21, 1711. Charles, "impatient
for the fight, and to behold the enemy in his power," had ridden above
fifty leagues from Bender to Jassy, swam the Pruth at the risk of his
life, and found that the Czar had marched off in triumph. He contrived
to rip up the Vizier's robe with his spur, "remonta à cheval, et
retourna a Bender le desespoir dans le cœur" (_Histoire de Charles
XII._, Livre v. _s.f._).]

Wilna_, published in 1816, pp. 133-141. "I hurried out, and arrived at
the Hôtel d'Angleterre.... [Warsaw, December 10, 1812]. I saw a small
carriage body placed on a sledge made of four pieces of fir: it had
stood some crashes, and was much damaged.... The ministers joined me in
addressing to him ... wishes for the preservation of his health and the
prosperity of his journey. He replied, 'I never was better; if I carried
the devil with me, I should be all the better for that (_Quand j'aurai
le diable je ne m'en porterai que mieux_).' These were his last words.
He then mounted the humble sledge, which bore Cæsar and his fortune, and
disappeared." The passage is quoted in the _Quarterly Review_, October,

[297] [Simon Bolivar (_El Libertador_), 1783-1830, was at the height of
his power and fame at the beginning of 1823. In 1821 he had united New
Grenada to Venezuela under the name of the Republic of Columbia, and on
the 1st of September he made a solemn entry into Lima. He was greeted
with acclaim, but in accepting the honours which his fellow-citizens
showered upon him, he warned them against the dangers of tyranny.
"Beware," he said, "of a Napoleon or an Iturbide." Byron, at one time,
had a mind to settle in "Bolivar's country" (letter to Ellice, June 12,
1821, _Letters_, 1901, vi. 89); and he christened his yacht _The

San Martin assumed the title of Protector, and, August 3, 4, 1821,

and bade the Spaniards tremble if they "abused his indulgence."

[310] [Patrick Henry, born May 29, 1736, died June 6, 1799, was one of
the leading spirits of the American Revolution. His father, John Henry,
a Scotchman, a cousin of the historian, William Robertson, had acquired
a small property in Virginia. Patrick was not exactly "forest born,"
but, as a child, loved to play truant "in the forest with his gun or
over his angle-rod." He first came into notice as an orator in the
"Parson's Cause," a suit brought by a minister of the Established Church
to recover his salary, which had been fixed at 16,000 lbs. of tobacco.
In his speech he is said to have struck the key-note of the Revolution
by arguing that "a king, by disallowing acts of a salutary nature, from
being the father of his people, degenerates into a tyrant, and forfeits
all right to his subjects' obedience." His famous speech against the
"Stamps Act" was delivered in the House of Burgesses of Virginia, May
29, 1765. One passage, with which, no doubt, Byron was familiar, has
passed into history. "Cæsar had his Brutus--Charles the First had his
Cromwell--and George the Third--" Henry was interrupted with a shout of
"Treason! treason!!" but finished the sentence with, and "George the
Third _may profit by their example_. If _this_ be treason, make the most
of it."

Henry was delegate to the first Continental Congress, five times
Governor of Virginia, and was appointed U.S. Senator in 1794.

His contemporaries said that he was "the greatest orator that ever
lived." He seems to have exercised a kind of magical influence over his
hearers, which they could not explain, which charmed and overwhelmed
them, and "has left behind a tradition of bewitching persuasiveness and
almost prophetic sublimity."--See _Life of Patrick Henry_, by William
Wirt, 1845, _passim._]

[311] ["I have been over Verona. The amphitheatre is wonderful--beats
even Greece. Of the truth of Juliet's story they seem tenacious to a
degree, insisting on the fact, giving a date (1303), and showing a tomb.
It is a plain, open, and partly decayed sarcophagus, with withered
leaves in it, in a wild and desolate conventual garden, once a cemetery,
now ruined to the very graves. The situation struck me as very
appropriate to the legend, being blighted as their love.... The Gothic
monuments of the Scaliger princes pleased me, but 'a poor virtuoso am
I.'"--Letter to Moore, November 7, 1816, _Letters_, 1899, iii. 386, 387.
The tombs of the Scaligers are close to the Church of Santa Maria
l'Antica. Juliet's tomb, "of red Verona marble," is in the garden of the
_Orfanotrofio_, between the Via Cappucini and the Adige. It is not "that
ancient vault where all the kindred of the Capulets lie," which has long
since been destroyed. Since 1814 Verona had been under Austria's sway,

[316] {563}[Alexander I. (Paulowitsch), 1777-1825, succeeded his father
in 1801. He began his reign well. Taxation was diminished, judicial
penalties were remitted, universities were founded and reorganized,
personal servitude was abolished or restricted throughout the empire. At
the height of his power and influence, when he was regarded as the
Liberator of Europe, he granted a Constitution to Poland, based on
liberal if not democratic principles (June 21, 1815). But after a time
he reverted to absolutism. Autocracy at home, a mystical and sentimental
alliance with autocrats abroad, were incompatible with the indulgence of
liberal proclivities. "After the Congresses of Aix-la-Chapelle and
Troppau," writes M. Rambaud (_History of Russia_, 1888, ii. 384), "he
was no longer the same man.... From that time he considered himself the
dupe of his generous ideas ... at Carlsbad, at Laybach, and at Verona,
Alexander was already the leader of the European reaction." But even to
the last he believed that he could run with the hare and hunt with the
hounds. "They may say of me," he exclaimed, "what they will; but I have
lived and shall die republican" (ibid., p. 398).

Alexander was a man of ideas, a sentimentalist, and a _poseur_, but he
had an eye to the main chance. Whatever cause or dynasty suffered, the
Emperor Alexander was still triumphant. Byron's special grudge against
him at this time was due to his vacillation with regard to the cause of
Greek Independence. But he is too contemptuous. There were points in
common between the "Coxcomb Czar" and his satirist; and it is far from
certain that if the twain had changed places Byron might not have proved
just "such an Alexander." In one respect their destiny was alike. The
greatest sorrow of their lives was the death of a natural daughter.]

[319] [Frédéric César La Harpe (1754-1838) was appointed by Catherine
II. Governor to the Grand-Dukes Alexander and Constantine. It was from
La Harpe's teaching that Alexander imbibed his liberal ideas. In 1816,
when Byron passed the summer in Switzerland, La Harpe was domiciled at
Lausanne, and it is possible that a meeting took place.]

[320] [Alexander's platonic attachment to the Baronne de Krüdener (Barbe
Julie de Wietenhoff), beauty, novelist, _illuminée_, was the source of
amusement rather than scandal. The Baronne, then in her fiftieth year,
was the channel through which Franz Bader's theory or doctrine of the
"Holy Alliance" was conveyed to the enthusiastic and receptive Czar. It
was only a passing whim. Alexander's mysticism was for ornament, not for
use, and, before very long, Egeria and her Muscovite Numa parted
company.]

[326] {566} [Constant (Henri Benjamin de Rebecque, 1767-1830) was the
"stormy petrel" of debate in the French Chamber. For instance, in a
discussion on secret service money for the police (July 27, 1822), he
exclaimed, "Vous les répresentez-vous payant d'une main le salaire du
vol, et tenant peut-être un crucifix de l'autre?" No wonder that there
were "violens murmures, cris d'indignation à droite." The duel, however,
did not arise out of a speech in the Chamber, but from a letter of June
5, 1822, in _La Quotidienne_, in which the Marquis de Forbin des Issarts
replied to some letters of Constant, which had appeared in the
_Courrier_ and _Constitutionnel_. Constant was lame, and accordingly
both combatants "out été places à dix petits pas sur des chaises." Both
fired twice, but neither "was a penny the worse." (See _La Grande
Encyclopédie_, art. "Constant;" and, for details, _La Quotidienne_, June

[327] [Louis XVIII. (Louis Stanislas Xavier, 1755-1824) passed several
years of exile in England, at Goswell, Wanstead, and latterly at
Hartwell, near Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire. When he entered Paris as
king, in May, 1814, he was in his fifty-ninth year, inordinately bulky
and unwieldy--a king _pour rire_. "C'est ce gros goutteux," explained an
_ouvrier_ to a bystander, who had asked, "Which is the king?" Fifteen
mutton cutlets, "sautées au jus," for breakfast; fifteen mutton cutlets
served with a "sauce à la champagne," for dinner; to say nothing of
strawberries, and sweet apple-puffs between meals, made digestion and
locomotion difficult. It was no wonder that he was a martyr to the gout.
But he cared for nature and for books as well as for eating. His
_Lettres d'Artwell_ (Paris, 1830), which profess to be selections from
his correspondence with a friend, give a pleasant picture of the _roi en
exil_. His wife, Louise de Savoie, died November, 1810, and in the
following April he writes (_Lettres_, pp. 70, 71), "Mars a maintenu le
bien d'un hiver fort doux; point encore de goutte; _à brebis tondue,
Dieu measure le vent_. Hélas! je l'éprouve bien qu'elle est tondue cette
pauvre brebis!... je me promène dans le jardin, je vois mes rosiers qui
poussent bien; a qui offrirai-je les roses?... Eh bien! je ne voudrais
pas que cette goutte d'absinthe cessât, car pour cela il faudrait
l'oublier. L'oublier! Ah Dieu! Je suis comme les enfans d'Israël qui
disaient: _Super flumina Babylonis ... Sion._ Mais ajoutons tout de
suite: _Si oblitus fuero hit, Jerusalem, oblivioni detur dextera mea_."
In another letter, June 8, 1811, he criticizes some translations of
Horace, and laments that the good Père Sanadon has confined himself to
the _Opera Expurgata_. Not, he adds, that he would not have excluded one
or two odes, "mais on a impitoyablement sabré des choses délicieuses"
(_Lettres_, p. 98).

To his wit, Chateaubriand testifies (_The Congress, etc._, 1838, i.
262). At the council, when affairs of state were being discussed, the
king "would say in his clear shrill voice, 'I am going to make you
laugh, M. de Chateaubriand.' The other ministers fumed with impatience,
but Chateaubriand laughed, not as a courtier, but as a human being."]

suicide by cutting his throat with a penknife (August 12, 1822). He was
the uncompromising and successful opponent of popular causes in Ireland,
Italy, and elsewhere, and, as such, Byron assailed him, alive and dead,
with the bitterest invective. (See, for instance, the "Dedication" to
_Don Juan_, stanzas xi.-xvi., sundry epigrams, and an "Epitaph.") In the
Preface to Cantos VI., VII., VIII., of _Don Juan_, he justifies the
inclusion of a stanza or two on Castlereagh, which had been written
"before his decease," and, again, alludes to his suicide. (For an
estimate of his career and character, see _Letters_, 1900, iv. 108, 109,

on the question of the Queen's message (June 7, 1820), and by his avowal
"of an unaltered regard and affection" for that "illustrious personage"
herself. There was, too, the prospect of Catholic Emancipation. In 1821
he had spoken in favour of Plunket's bills, and, the next year (April
30, 1822), he had brought in a bill to remove the disabilities of Roman
Catholic peers from sitting in the House of Lords. If Canning persisted

that they could go on for ever.... The bill of 1819 was really a great
relaxation of the Pitt system, and when you are crying out _spoliation_
and _confiscation_, when you are bawling out so lustily about the robbery
committed on you by the fund-holders and the placemen, and are praising
the infernal Pitt system at the same time, ... you say they are
receiving, the fund-vagabonds in particular, _more_ than they ought." It
is evident that Byron's verse is a reverberation of Cobbett's prose.]

the brothers to the rank of baron, and appointed Baron Nathan Mayer
Consul-General in London, and Baron James to the same post in Paris. In

mocked. There is the story that Talleyrand once presented the Parisian
brother to Montmorenci as _M. le premier Juif_ to _M. le premier Baron
Chrétien_; while another tale, parent or offspring of the preceding,
which appeared in _La Quotidienne_, December 21, 1822, testifies to the
fact, not recorded, that a Rothschild was at Verona during the Congress:

believed that Capo d'Istria was still in the service of the Czar, but,
according to Allison, his advocacy of his compatriots the Greeks had led

renounced the title of Empress, and was created Duchess of Parma,
Placentia, and Guastalla. After Napoleon's death (May 5, 1821). "Proud
Austria's mournful flower" did not long remain a widow, but speedily and
secretly married her chamberlain and gentleman of honour, Count Adam de

of Verona in the interest of her son, the ex-King of Rome, to whom
Napoleon had bequeathed money and heirlooms. She was a solemn stately
personage, _tant soit peu declassée_, and the other potentates whispered
and joked at her expense. Chateaubriand says that when the Duke of
Wellington was bored with the meetings of the Congress, he would while

victorious foe, the King of Prussia, giving "la main à l'archduchesse
Marie-Louise jusqu'à son carrosse" (_Le Constitutionnel_, November 19,
1822). "All the world wondered" what Andromache did, and how she would
fare--_dans ce galère_. It is difficult to explain the allusion to
Pyrrhus. Andromache was the unwilling bride of Pyrrhus or Neoptolemus,
whose father had slain her husband, Hector; Marie Louise the willing
bride of Neipperg, who had certainly fought at Leipsic, but who could
not be said to have given the final blow to Napoleon at Waterloo.
Pyrrhus must stand for the victorious foe, and the right arm on which
the too-forgiving Andromache leant, must have been offered by "the
respectful gallantry" of the Duke of Wellington.]

                       INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_

The first canto of _The Island_ was finished January 10, 1823. We know
that Byron was still at work on "the poeshie," January 25 (_Letters_,
1901, vi. 164), and may reasonably conjecture that a somewhat illegible
date affixed to the fourth canto, stands for February 14, 1823. The MS.
had been received in London before April 9 (_ibid_., p. 192); and on
June 26, 1823, _The Island; or, The Adventures of Christian and his
Comrades_, was published by John Hunt.

Byron's "Advertisement," or note, prefixed to _The Island_ contains all
that need be said with regard to the "sources" of the poem.

Two separate works were consulted: (1) _A Narrative of the Mutiny on
board His Majesty's Ship Bounty, and the subsequent Voyage of ... the
Ship's Boat from Tafoa, one of the Friendly Islands, to Timor, a Dutch
Settlement in the East Indies_, written by Lieutenant William Bligh,
1790; and (2) _An Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands_, Compiled
and Arranged from the Extensive Communications of Mr. William Mariner,
by John Martin, M.D., 1817.

According to George Clinton (_Life and Writings of Lord Byron_, 1824, p.
656), Byron was profoundly impressed by Mariner's report of the scenery
and folklore of the _Friendly Islands_, was "never tired of talking of
it to his friends," and, in order to turn this poetic material to
account, finally bethought him that Bligh's _Narrative_ of the mutiny of
the _Bounty_ would serve as a framework or structure "for an embroidery
of rare device"--the figures and foliage of a tropical pattern. That, at
least, is the substance of Clinton's analysis of the "sources" of _The
Island_, and whether he spoke, or only feigned to speak, with authority,
his criticism is sound and to the point. The story of the mutiny of the
_Bounty_, which is faithfully related in the first canto, is not, as the
second title implies, a prelude to the "Adventures of Christian and his
Comrades," but to a description of "The Island," an Ogygia of the South
Seas.

It must be borne in mind that Byron's acquaintance with the details of
the mutiny of the _Bounty_ was derived exclusively from Bligh's
_Narrative_; that he does not seem to have studied the minutes of the
court-martial on Peter Heywood and the other prisoners (September,
1792), or to have possessed the information that in 1809, and, again, in
1815, the Admiralty received authentic information with regard to the
final settlement of Christian and his comrades on Pitcairn Island.
Articles, however, had appeared in the _Quarterly Review_, February,
1810, vol. iii. pp. 23, 24, and July, 1815, vol. xiii. pp. 376-378,
which contained an extract from the log-book of Captain Mayhew Folger,
of the American ship _Topaz_, dated September 29, 1808, and letters from
Folger (March 1, 1813), and Sir Thomas Staines, October 18, 1814, which
solved the mystery. Moreover, the article of February, 1810, is quoted
in the notes (pp. 313-318) affixed to Miss Mitford's _Christina, the
Maid of the South Seas_, 1811, a poem founded on Bligh's _Narrative_, of
which neither Byron or his reviewers seem to have heard.

But whatever may have been his opportunities of ascertaining the facts
of the case, it is certain (see his note to Canto IV. section vi. line
122) that he did not know what became of Christian, and that whereas in
the first canto he follows the text of Bligh's _Narrative_, in the three
last cantos he draws upon his imagination, turning Tahiti into Toobonai
(Tubuai), and transporting Toobonai from one archipelago to
another--from the Society to the Friendly Islands.

Another and still more surprising feature of _The Island_ is that Byron
accepts, without qualification or reserve, the guilt of the mutineers
and the innocence and worth of Lieutenant Bligh. It is true that by
inheritance he was imbued with the traditions of the service, and from
personal experience understood the necessity of discipline on board
ship; but it may be taken for granted that if he had known that the
sympathy, if not the esteem, of the public had been transferred from
Bligh to Christian, that in the opinion of grave and competent writers,
the guilt of mutiny on the high seas had been almost condoned by the
violence and brutality of the commanding officer, he would have sided
with the oppressed rather than the oppressor. As it is, he takes Bligh
at his own valuation, and carefully abstains from "eulogizing mutiny."
(Letter to L. Hunt, January 25, 1823.)

The story of the "mutiny of the _Bounty_" happened in this wise. In 1787
it occurred to certain West India planters and merchants, resident in
London, that it would benefit the natives, and perhaps themselves, if
the bread-fruit tree, which flourished in Tahiti (the Otaheite of
Captain Cook and Sir Joseph Banks, see _Poetical Works_, 1899, ii. 7,
note 2) and other islands of the South Seas, could be acclimatized in
the West Indies. A petition was addressed to the king, with the result
that a vessel, with a burden of 215 tons, which Banks christened the
_Bounty_, sailed from Spithead December 23, 1787. Lieutenant William
Bligh, who had sailed with Cook in the _Resolution_, acted as commanding
officer, and under him were five midshipmen, a master, two master's
mates, etc.--forty-four persons all told. The _Bounty_ arrived at Tahiti
October 26, 1788, and there for six delightful months the ship's company
tarried, "fleeting the time carelessly, as in the elder world." But
"Scripture saith an ending to all fine things must be," and on April 4,
1789, the _Bounty_, with a cargo of over a thousand bread-fruit trees,
planted in pots, tubs, and boxes (see for plate of the pots, etc., _A
Voyage, etc._, 1792, p. 1), sailed away westward for the Cape of Good
Hope, and the West Indies. All went well at first, but "just before
sun-rising" on Tuesday, April 28, 1789, "the north-westernmost of the
Friendly Islands, called Tofoa, bearing north-east," Fletcher Christian,
who was mate of the watch, assisted by Charles Churchill,
master-at-arms, Alexander Smith (the John Adams of Pitcairn Island), and
Thomas Burkitt, able seamen, seized the captain, tied his hands behind
his back, hauled him out of his berth, and forced him on deck. The
boatswain, William Cole, was ordered to hoist out the ship's launch,
which measured twenty-three feet from stem to stern, and into this open
boat Bligh, together with eighteen of the crew, who were or were
supposed to be on his side, were thrust, on pain of instant death. When
they were in the boat they were "veered round with a rope, and finally
cast adrift." Bligh and his eighteen innocent companions sailed
westward, and, after a voyage of "twelve hundred leagues," during which
they were preserved from death and destruction by the wise ordering and
patient heroism of the commander, safely anchored in Kœpang Bay, on the
north-west coast of the Isle of Timor, June 14, 1789. (See Bligh's
_Narrative, etc._, 1790, pp. 11-88; and _The Island_, Canto I. section
ix. lines 169-201.)

The _Bounty_, with the remainder of the crew, twenty-five in number,
"the most able of the ship's company," sailed eastward, first to
Toobooai, or Tubuai, an island to the south of the Society Islands,
thence to Tahiti (June 6), back to Tubuai (June 26), and yet again, to
Tahiti (September 20), where sixteen of the mutineers, including the
midshipman George Stewart (the "Torquil" of _The Island_), were put on
shore. Finally, September 21, 1789, Fletcher Christian, with the
_Bounty_ and eight of her crew, six Tahitian men, and twelve women,
sailed away still further east to unknown shores, and, so it was
believed, disappeared for good and all. Long afterwards it was known
that they had landed on Pitcairn Island, broken up the _Bounty_, and
founded a permanent settlement.

When Bligh returned to England (March 14, 1790), and acquainted the
Government "with the atrocious act of piracy and mutiny" which had been
committed on the high seas, the _Pandora_ frigate, with Captain Edwards,
was despatched to apprehend the mutineers, and bring them back to
England for trial and punishment. The _Pandora_ reached Tahiti March 23,
1791, set sail, with fourteen prisoners, May 8, and was wrecked on the
"Great Barrier Reef" north-east of Queensland, August 29, 1791. Four of
the prisoners, including George Stewart, who had been manacled, and were
confined in "Pandora's box," perished in the wreck, and the remaining
ten were brought back to England, and tried by court-martial. (See _The
Eventful History of the Mutiny, etc._ (by Sir John Barrow), 1831, pp.
205-244.)

The story, which runs through the second, third, and fourth cantos, may
possibly owe some of its details to a vague recollection of incidents
which happened, or were supposed to happen, at Tahiti, in the interval
between the final departure of the _Bounty_, September 21, 1789, and the
arrival of the _Pandora_, March 23, 1791; but, as a whole, it is a work
of fiction.

With the exception of the fifteenth and sixteenth cantos of _Don Juan_,
_The Island_ was the last poem of any importance which Byron lived to
write, and the question naturally suggests itself--Is the new song as
good as the old? Byron answers the question himself. He tells Leigh Hunt
(January 25, 1823) that he hopes the "poem will be a little above the
ordinary run of periodical poesy," and that, though portions of the
Toobonai (_sic_) islanders are "pamby," he intends "to scatter some
_un_common places here and there nevertheless." On the whole, in point
of conception and execution, _The Island_ is weaker and less coherent
than the _Corsair_; but it contains lines and passages (_e.g._ Canto I.
lines 107-124, 133-140; Canto II. lines 272-297; Canto IV. lines 94-188)
which display a finer feeling and a more "exalted wit" than the "purple
patches" of _The Turkish Tales_.

The poetic faculty is somewhat exhausted, but the poetic vision has been
purged and heightened by suffering and self-knowledge.

_The Island_ was reviewed in the _Monthly Review_, July, 1823, E.S.,
vol. 101, pp. 316-319; the _New Monthly Magazine_, N.S., 1823, vol. 8,
pp. 136-141; the _Atlantic Magazine_, April, 1826, vol. 2, pp. 333-337;

    The morning watch was come; the vessel lay
    Her course, and gently made her liquid way;[ex]
    The cloven billow flashed from off her prow
    In furrows formed by that majestic plough;
    The waters with their world were all before;
    Behind, the South Sea's many an islet shore.
    The quiet night, now dappling, 'gan to wane,
    Dividing darkness from the dawning main;
    The dolphins, not unconscious of the day,
    Swam high, as eager of the coming ray;
    The stars from broader beams began to creep,
    And lift their shining eyelids from the deep;[ey]

    The gallant Chief[352] within his cabin slept,

    Of toils rewarded, and of dangers o'er;                             20
    His name was added to the glorious roll
    Of those who search the storm-surrounded Pole.
    The worst was over, and the rest seemed sure,[353]
    And why should not his slumber be secure?
    Alas! his deck was trod by unwilling feet,
    And wilder hands would hold the vessel's sheet;
    Young hearts, which languished for some sunny isle,
    Where summer years and summer women smile;
    Men without country, who, too long estranged,
    Had found no native home, or found it changed,                      30
    And, half uncivilised, preferred the cave
    Of some soft savage to the uncertain wave--
    The gushing fruits that nature gave unfilled;
    The wood without a path--but where they willed;
    The field o'er which promiscuous Plenty poured
    Her horn; the equal land without a lord;
    The wish--which ages have not yet subdued
    In man--to have no master save his mood;[354]
    The earth, whose mine was on its face, unsold,
    The glowing sun and produce all its gold;                           40
    The Freedom which can call each grot a home;
    The general garden, where all steps may roam,
    Where Nature owns a nation as her child,
    Exulting in the enjoyment of the wild;[ez]
    Their shells, their fruits, the only wealth they know,
    Their unexploring navy, the canoe;[fa]
    Their sport, the dashing breakers and the chase;
    Their strangest sight, an European face:--
    Such was the country which these strangers yearned
    To see again--a sight they dearly earned.                           50

    Awake, bold Bligh! the foe is at the gate!
    Awake! awake!----Alas! it is too late!
    Fiercely beside thy cot the mutineer
    Stands, and proclaims the reign of rage and fear.
    Thy limbs are bound, the bayonet at thy breast;
    The hands, which trembled at thy voice, arrest;
    Dragged o'er the deck, no more at thy command
    The obedient helm shall veer, the sail expand;
    That savage Spirit, which would lull by wrath
    Its desperate escape from Duty's path,                              60

    They come not; they are few, and, overawed,
    Must acquiesce, while sterner hearts applaud.
    In vain thou dost demand the cause: a curse
    Is all the answer, with the threat of worse.                        70
    Full in thine eyes is waved the glittering blade,
    Close to thy throat the pointed bayonet laid.
    The levelled muskets circle round thy breast
    In hands as steeled to do the deadly rest.
    Thou dar'st them to their worst, exclaiming--"Fire!"
    But they who pitied not could yet admire;
    Some lurking remnant of their former awe
    Restrained them longer than their broken law;
    They would not dip their souls at once in blood,
    But left thee to the mercies of the flood.[355]                     80

    The Saturnalia of unhoped-for power?
    The boat is lowered with all the haste of hate,
    With its slight plank between thee and thy fate;
    Her only cargo such a scant supply
    As promises the death their hands deny;
    And just enough of water and of bread
    To keep, some days, the dying from the dead:                        90
    Some cordage, canvass, sails, and lines, and twine,
    But treasures all to hermits of the brine,
    Were added after, to the earnest prayer
    Of those who saw no hope, save sea and air;
    And last, that trembling vassal of the Pole--
    The feeling compass--Navigation's soul.[356]


                    VI.

    And now the self-elected Chief finds time
    To stun the first sensation of his crime,
    And raise it in his followers--"Ho! the bowl!"[357]
    Lest passion should return to reason's shoal.[fb]                  100
    "Brandy for heroes!"[358] Burke could once exclaim--
    No doubt a liquid path to Epic fame;
    And such the new-born heroes found it here,
    And drained the draught with an applauding cheer.
    "Huzza! for Otaheite!"[359] was the cry.
    How strange such shouts from sons of Mutiny!
    The gentle island, and the genial soil,
    The friendly hearts, the feasts without a toil,
    The courteous manners but from nature caught,
    The wealth unhoarded, and the love unbought;                       110
    Could these have charms for rudest sea-boys, driven
    Before the mast by every wind of heaven?
    And now, even now prepared with others' woes
    To earn mild Virtue's vain desire, repose?
    Alas! such is our nature! all but aim
    At the same end by pathways not the same;
    Our means--our birth--our nation, and our name,
    Our fortune--temper--even our outward frame,
    Are far more potent o'er our yielding clay
    Than aught we know beyond our little day.                          120
    Yet still there whispers the small voice within,
    Heard through Gain's silence, and o'er Glory's din:
    Whatever creed be taught, or land be trod,
    Man's conscience is the Oracle of God.[360]


                    VII.

    The launch is crowded with the faithful few
    Who wait their Chief, a melancholy crew:
    But some remained reluctant on the deck
    Of that proud vessel--now a moral wreck--
    And viewed their Captain's fate with piteous eyes;
    While others scoffed his augured miseries,                         130
    Sneered at the prospect of his pigmy sail,
    And the slight bark so laden and so frail.
    The tender nautilus, who steers his prow,
    The sea-born sailor of his shell canoe,
    The ocean Mab, the fairy of the sea,
    Seems far less fragile, and, alas! more free.
    He, when the lightning-winged Tornados sweep
    The surge, is safe--his port is in the deep--
    And triumphs o'er the armadas of Mankind,
    Which shake the World, yet crumble in the wind.                    140


                    VIII.

    When all was now prepared, the vessel clear
    Which hailed her master in the mutineer,
    A seaman, less obdurate than his mates,
    Showed the vain pity which but irritates;
    Watched his late Chieftain with exploring eye,
    And told, in signs, repentant sympathy;
    Held the moist shaddock to his parched mouth,
    Which felt Exhaustion's deep and bitter drouth.
    But soon observed, this guardian was withdrawn,
    Nor further Mercy clouds Rebellion's dawn.[361]                    150
    Then forward stepped the bold and froward boy
    His Chief had cherished only to destroy,
    And, pointing to the helpless prow beneath,
    Exclaimed, "Depart at once! delay is death!"
    Yet then, even then, his feelings ceased not all:
    In that last moment could a word recall
    Remorse for the black deed as yet half done,
    And what he hid from many showed to one:
    When Bligh in stern reproach demanded where
    Was now his grateful sense of former care?                         160
    Where all his hopes to see his name aspire,
    And blazon Britain's thousand glories higher?
    His feverish lips thus broke their gloomy spell,
    "Tis that! 'tis that! I am in hell! in hell!"[362]
    No more he said; but urging to the bark
    His Chief, commits him to his fragile ark;
    These the sole accents from his tongue that fell,
    But volumes lurked below his fierce farewell.



                    IX.

    The arctic[363] Sun rose broad above the wave;
    The breeze now sank, now whispered from his cave;                  170
    As on the Æolian harp, his fitful wings
    Now swelled, now fluttered o'er his Ocean strings.[fc]
    With slow, despairing oar, the abandoned skiff
    Ploughs its drear progress to the scarce seen cliff,
    Which lifts its peak a cloud above the main:
    _That_ boat and ship shall never meet again!

    But 'tis not mine to tell their tale of grief,
    Their constant peril, and their scant relief;
    Their days of danger, and their nights of pain;
    Their manly courage even when deemed in vain;                      180
    The sapping famine, rendering scarce a son
    Known to his mother in the skeleton;[364]
    The ills that lessened still their little store,
    And starved even Hunger till he wrung no more;
    The varying frowns and favours of the deep,
    That now almost ingulfs, then leaves to creep
    With crazy oar and shattered strength along
    The tide that yields reluctant to the strong;
    The incessant fever of that arid thirst[365]
    Which welcomes, as a well, the clouds that burst                   190
    Above their naked bones, and feels delight
    In the cold drenching of the stormy night,
    And from the outspread canvass gladly wrings
    A drop to moisten Life's all-gasping springs;
    The savage foe escaped, to seek again
    More hospitable shelter from the main;
    The ghastly Spectres which were doomed at last
    To tell as true a tale of dangers past,
    As ever the dark annals of the deep
    Disclosed for man to dread or woman weep.                          200


                    X.

    We leave them to their fate, but not unknown
    Nor unredressed. Revenge may have her own:[fd]
    Roused Discipline aloud proclaims their cause,
    And injured Navies urge their broken laws.
    Pursue we on his track the mutineer,
    Whom distant vengeance had not taught to fear.
    Wide o'er the wave--away! away! away!
    Once more his eyes shall hail the welcome bay;
    Once more the happy shores without a law
    Receive the outlaws whom they lately saw;                          210
    Nature, and Nature's goddess--Woman--woos
    To lands where, save their conscience, none accuse;
    Where all partake the earth without dispute,[fe]
    And bread itself is gathered as a fruit;[366]
    Where none contest the fields, the woods, the streams:--
    The goldless Age, where Gold disturbs no dreams,
    Inhabits or inhabited the shore,
    Till Europe taught them better than before;
    Bestowed her customs, and amended theirs,
    But left her vices also to their heirs.[367]                       220
    Away with this! behold them as they were,
    Do good with Nature, or with Nature err.
    "Huzza! for Otaheite!" was the cry,
    As stately swept the gallant vessel by.
    The breeze springs up; the lately flapping sail
    Extends its arch before the growing gale;
    In swifter ripples stream aside the seas,
    Which her bold bow flings off with dashing ease.
    Thus Argo ploughed the Euxine's virgin foam,[ff]
    But those she wafted still looked back to home;                    230
    These spurn their country with their rebel bark,
    And fly her as the raven fled the Ark;
    And yet they seek to nestle with the dove,
    And tame their fiery spirits down to Love.

                        End of Canto 1^st^, J^n 14.




                            CANTO THE SECOND.


                    I.

    How pleasant were the songs of Toobonai,[368]
    When Summer's Sun went down the coral bay!
    Come, let us to the islet's softest shade,
    And hear the warbling birds! the damsels said:
    The wood-dove from the forest depth shall coo,
    Like voices of the Gods from Bolotoo;[369]
    We'll cull the flowers that grow above the dead,
    For these most bloom where rests the warrior's head;
    And we will sit in Twilight's face, and see
    The sweet Moon glancing through the Tooa[370] tree,                 10
    The lofty accents of whose sighing bough
    Shall sadly please us as we lean below;
    Or climb the steep, and view the surf in vain
    Wrestle with rocky giants o'er the main,
    Which spurn in columns back the baffled spray.
    How beautiful are these! how happy they,
    Who, from the toil and tumult of their lives,
    Steal to look down where nought but Ocean strives!
    Even He too loves at times the blue lagoon,
    And smooths his ruffled mane beneath the Moon.                      20


                    II.

    Yes--from the sepulchre we'll gather flowers,
    Then feast like spirits in their promised bowers,
    Then plunge and revel in the rolling surf,
    Then lay our limbs along the tender turf,
    And, wet and shining from the sportive toil,
    Anoint our bodies with the fragrant oil,
    And plait our garlands gathered from the grave,
    And wear the wreaths that sprung from out the brave.
    But lo! night comes, the Mooa[371] woos us back,
    The sound of mats[372] are heard along our track;                   30
    Anon the torchlight dance shall fling its sheen
    In flashing mazes o'er the Marly's[373] green;
    And we too will be there; we too recall
    The memory bright with many a festival,
    Ere Fiji blew the shell of war, when foes
    For the first time were wafted in canoes.[fg]
    Alas! for them the flower of manhood bleeds;
    Alas! for them our fields are rank with weeds:
    Forgotten is the rapture, or unknown,[fh]
    Of wandering with the Moon and Love alone.                          40
    But be it so:--_they_ taught us how to wield
    The club, and rain our arrows o'er the field:
    Now let them reap the harvest of their art!
    But feast to-night! to-morrow we depart.
    Strike up the dance! the Cava bowl[374] fill high!
    Drain every drop!--to-morrow we may die.
    In summer garments be our limbs arrayed;
    Around our waists the Tappa's white displayed;
    Thick wreaths shall form our coronal,[375] like Spring's,
    And round our necks shall glance the Hooni strings;                 50
    So shall their brighter hues contrast the glow
    Of the dusk bosoms that beat high below.


                    III.

    But now the dance is o'er--yet stay awhile;
    Ah, pause! nor yet put out the social smile.
    To-morrow for the Mooa we depart,
    But not to-night--to-night is for the heart.
    Again bestow the wreaths we gently woo,
    Ye young Enchantresses of gay Licoo![376]
    How lovely are your forms! how every sense
    Bows to your beauties, softened, but intense,[fi]                   60
    Like to the flowers on Mataloco's steep,
    Which fling their fragrance far athwart the deep!--
    We too will see Licoo; but--oh! my heart!--
    What do I say?--to-morrow we depart!


                    IV.

    Thus rose a song--the harmony of times
    Before the winds blew Europe o'er these climes.
    True, they had vices--such are Nature's growth--
    But only the barbarian's--we have both;
    The sordor of civilisation, mixed
    With all the savage which Man's fall hath fixed.                    70
    Who hath not seen Dissimulation's reign,
    The prayers of Abel linked to deeds of Cain?
    Who such would see may from his lattice view
    The Old World more degraded than the New,--
    Now _new_ no more, save where Columbia rears
    Twin giants, born by Freedom to her spheres,
    Where Chimborazo, over air,--earth,--wave,--
    Glares with his Titan eye, and sees no slave.[fj][377]


                    V.

    Such was this ditty of Tradition's days,
    Which to the dead a lingering fame conveys                          80
    In song, where Fame as yet hath left no sign
    Beyond the sound whose charm is half divine;
    Which leaves no record to the sceptic eye,
    But yields young History all to Harmony;
    A boy Achilles, with the Centaur's lyre
    In hand, to teach him to surpass his sire.
    For one long-cherished ballad's[378] simple stave,
    Rung from the rock, or mingled with the wave,
    Or from the bubbling streamlet's grassy side,
    Or gathering mountain echoes as they glide,                         90
    Hath greater power o'er each true heart and ear,
    Than all the columns Conquest's minions rear;[fk]
    Invites, when Hieroglyphics[379] are a theme
    For sages' labours, or the student's dream;
    Attracts, when History's volumes are a toil,--
    The first, the freshest bud of Feeling's soil.
    Such was this rude rhyme--rhyme is of the rude--
    But such inspired the Norseman's solitude,
    Who came and conquered; such, wherever rise
    Lands which no foes destroy or civilise,                           100
    Exist: and what can our accomplished art
    Of verse do more than reach the awakened heart?[380]


                    VI.

    And sweetly now those untaught melodies
    Broke the luxurious silence of the skies,
    The sweet siesta of a summer day,
    The tropic afternoon of Toobonai,
    When every flower was bloom, and air was balm,
    And the first breath began to stir the palm,
    The first yet voiceless wind to urge the wave
    All gently to refresh the thirsty cave,                            110
    Where sat the Songstress with the stranger boy,
    Who taught her Passion's desolating joy,
    Too powerful over every heart, but most
    O'er those who know not how it may be lost;
    O'er those who, burning in the new-born fire,
    Like martyrs revel in their funeral pyre,
    With such devotion to their ecstacy,
    That Life knows no such rapture as to die:
    And die they do; for earthly life has nought
    Matched with that burst of Nature, even in thought;                120
    And all our dreams of better life above
    But close in one eternal gush of Love.


                    VII.

    There sat the gentle savage of the wild,
    In growth a woman, though in years a child,
    As childhood dates within our colder clime,
    Where nought is ripened rapidly save crime;
    The infant of an infant world, as pure
    From Nature--lovely, warm, and premature;
    Dusky like night, but night with all her stars;
    Or cavern sparkling with its native spars;                         130
    With eyes that were a language and a spell,
    A form like Aphrodite's in her shell,
    With all her loves around her on the deep,
    Voluptuous as the first approach of sleep;
    Yet full of life--for through her tropic cheek
    The blush would make its way, and all but speak;
    The sun-born blood suffused her neck, and threw
    O'er her clear nut-brown skin a lucid hue,
    Like coral reddening through the darkened wave,
    Which draws the diver to the crimson cave.                         140
    Such was this daughter of the southern seas,
    Herself a billow in her energies,[fl]
    To bear the bark of others' happiness,
    Nor feel a sorrow till their joy grew less:
    Her wild and warm yet faithful bosom knew
    No joy like what it gave; her hopes ne'er drew
    Aught from Experience, that chill touchstone, whose
    Sad proof reduces all things from their hues:
    She feared no ill, because she knew it not,
    Or what she knew was soon--too soon--forgot:                       150
    Her smiles and tears had passed, as light winds pass
    O'er lakes to ruffle, not destroy, their glass,
    Whose depths unsearched, and fountains from the hill,
    Restore their surface, in itself so still,
    Until the Earthquake tear the Naiad's cave,
    Root up the spring, and trample on the wave,
    And crush the living waters to a mass,
    The amphibious desert of the dank morass!
    And must their fate be hers? The eternal change
    But grasps Humanity with quicker range;                            160
    And they who fall but fall as worlds will fall,
    To rise, if just, a Spirit o'er them all.


                    VIII.

    And who is he? the blue-eyed northern child[381]
    Of isles more known to man, but scarce less wild;
    The fair-haired offspring of the Hebrides,
    Where roars the Pentland with its whirling seas;
    Rocked in his cradle by the roaring wind,
    The tempest-born in body and in mind,
    His young eyes opening on the ocean-foam,
    Had from that moment deemed the deep his home,                     170
    The giant comrade of his pensive moods,
    The sharer of his craggy solitudes,
    The only Mentor of his youth, where'er
    His bark was borne; the sport of wave and air;
    A careless thing, who placed his choice in chance,
    Nursed by the legends of his land's romance;
    Eager to hope, but not less firm to bear,
    Acquainted with all feelings save despair.
    Placed in the Arab's clime he would have been
    As bold a rover as the sands have seen,                            180
    And braved their thirst with as enduring lip
    As Ishmael, wafted on his Desert-Ship;[382]
    Fixed upon Chili's shore, a proud cacique:
    On Hellas' mountains, a rebellious Greek;[383]
    Born in a tent, perhaps a Tamerlane;
    Bred to a throne, perhaps unfit to reign.
    For the same soul that rends its path to sway,
    If reared to such, can find no further prey
    Beyond itself, and must retrace its way,[384]
    Plunging for pleasure into pain: the same                          190
    Spirit which made a Nero, Rome's worst shame,
    A humbler state and discipline of heart,
    Had formed his glorious namesake's counterpart;[385]
    But grant his vices, grant them all his own,
    How small their theatre without a throne!


                    IX.

    Thou smilest:--these comparisons seem high
    To those who scan all things with dazzled eye;
    Linked with the unknown name of one whose doom
    Has nought to do with glory or with Rome,
    With Chili, Hellas, or with Araby;--                               200
    Thou smilest?--Smile; 'tis better thus than sigh;
    Yet such he might have been; he was a man,
    A soaring spirit, ever in the van,
    A patriot hero or despotic chief,[fm]
    To form a nation's glory or its grief,
    Born under auspices which make us more
    Or less than we delight to ponder o'er.
    But these are visions; say, what was he here?
    A blooming boy, a truant mutineer.
    The fair-haired Torquil, free as Ocean's spray,                    210
    The husband of the bride of Toobonai.


                    X.

    By Neuha's side he sate, and watched the waters,--
    Neuha, the sun-flower of the island daughters,
    Highborn, (a birth at which the herald smiles,
    Without a scutcheon for these secret isles,)
    Of a long race, the valiant and the free,
    The naked knights of savage chivalry,
    Whose grassy cairns ascend along the shore;
    And thine--I've seen--Achilles! do no more.[386]
    She, when the thunder-bearing strangers came,                      220
    In vast canoes, begirt with bolts of flame,
    Topped with tall trees, which, loftier than the palm,
    Seemed rooted in the deep amidst its calm:
    But when the winds awakened, shot forth wings
    Broad as the cloud along the horizon flings,
    And swayed the waves, like cities of the sea,
    Making the very billows look less free;--
    She, with her paddling oar and dancing prow,
    Shot through the surf, like reindeer through the snow,
    Swift-gliding o'er the breaker's whitening edge,                   230
    Light as a Nereid in her ocean sledge,
    And gazed and wondered at the giant hulk,
    Which heaved from wave to wave its trampling bulk.
    The anchor dropped; it lay along the deep,
    Like a huge lion in the sun asleep,
    While round it swarmed the Proas' flitting chain,
    Like summer bees that hum around his mane.


                    XI.

    The white man landed!--need the rest be told?
    The New World stretched its dusk hand to the Old;
    Each was to each a marvel, and the tie                             240
    Of wonder warmed to better sympathy.
    Kind was the welcome of the sun-born sires,
    And kinder still their daughters' gentler fires.
    Their union grew: the children of the storm
    Found beauty linked with many a dusky form;
    While these in turn admired the paler glow,
    Which seemed so white in climes that knew no snow.
    The chace, the race, the liberty to roam,
    The soil where every cottage showed a home;
    The sea-spread net, the lightly launched canoe,                    250
    Which stemmed the studded archipelago,
    O'er whose blue bosom rose the starry isles;
    The healthy slumber, earned by sportive toils;
    The palm, the loftiest Dryad of the woods,
    Within whose bosom infant Bacchus broods,
    While eagles scarce build higher than the crest
    Which shadows o'er the vineyard in her breast;
    The Cava feast, the Yam, the Cocoa's root,
    Which bears at once the cup, and milk, and fruit;
    The Bread-tree, which, without the ploughshare, yields             260
    The unreaped harvest of unfurrowed fields,
    And bakes its unadulterated loaves
    Without a furnace in unpurchased groves,
    And flings off famine from its fertile breast,
    A priceless market for the gathering guest;--
    These, with the luxuries of seas and woods,
    The airy joys of social solitudes,
    Tamed each rude wanderer to the sympathies
    Of those who were more happy, if less wise,
    Did more than Europe's discipline had done,                        270
    And civilised Civilisation's son!


                    XII.

    Of these, and there was many a willing pair,
    Neuha[387] and Torquil were not the least fair:
    Both children of the isles, though distant far;
    Both born beneath a sea-presiding star;
    Both nourished amidst Nature's native scenes,
    Loved to the last, whatever intervenes
    Between us and our Childhood's sympathy,
    Which still reverts to what first caught the eye.
    He who first met the Highlands' swelling blue                      280
    Will love each peak that shows a kindred hue,
    Hail in each crag a friend's familiar face,
    And clasp the mountain in his Mind's embrace.
    Long have I roamed through lands which are not mine,
    Adored the Alp, and loved the Apennine,
    Revered Parnassus, and beheld the steep
    Jove's Ida and Olympus crown the deep:
    But 'twas not all long ages' lore, nor all
    _Their_ nature held me in their thrilling thrall;
    The infant rapture still survived the boy,                         290
    And Loch-na-gar with Ida looked o'er Troy,[388]
    Mixed Celtic memories with the Phrygian mount,
    And Highland linns with Castalie's clear fount.
    Forgive me, Homer's universal shade!
    Forgive me, Phœbus! that my fancy strayed;
    The North and Nature taught me to adore
    Your scenes sublime, from those beloved before.


                    XIII.

    The love which maketh all things fond and fair,
    The youth which makes one rainbow of the air,
    The dangers past, that make even Man enjoy                         300
    The pause in which he ceases to destroy,
    The mutual beauty, which the sternest feel
    Strike to their hearts like lightning to the steel,
    United the half savage and the whole,
    The maid and boy, in one absorbing soul.
    No more the thundering memory of the fight
    Wrapped his weaned bosom in its dark delight;
    No more the irksome restlessness of Rest
    Disturbed him like the eagle in her nest,
    Whose whetted beak[389] and far-pervading eye                      310
    Darts for a victim over all the sky:
    His heart was tamed to that voluptuous state,
    At once Elysian and effeminate,
    Which leaves no laurels o'er the Hero's urn;--
    These wither when for aught save blood they burn;
    Yet when their ashes in their nook are laid,
    Doth not the myrtle leave as sweet a shade?
    Had Cæsar known but Cleopatra's kiss,
    Rome had been free, the world had not been his.
    And what have Cæsar's deeds and Cæsar's fame                       320
    Done for the earth? We feel them in our shame.
    The gory sanction of his Glory stains
    The rust which tyrants cherish on our chains.
    Though Glory--Nature--Reason--Freedom, bid
    Roused millions do what single Brutus did--
    Sweep these mere mock-birds of the Despot's song
    From the tall bough where they have perched so long,--
    Still are we hawked at by such mousing owls,[390]
    And take for falcons those ignoble fowls,
    When but a word of freedom would dispel                            330
    These bugbears, as their terrors show too well.


                    XIV.

    Rapt in the fond forgetfulness of life,
    Neuha, the South Sea girl, was all a wife,
    With no distracting world to call her off
    From Love; with no Society to scoff
    At the new transient flame; no babbling crowd
    Of coxcombry in admiration loud,
    Or with adulterous whisper to alloy
    Her duty, and her glory, and her joy:
    With faith and feelings naked as her form,                         340
    She stood as stands a rainbow in a storm,
    Changing its hues with bright variety,
    But still expanding lovelier o'er the sky,
    Howe'er its arch may swell, its colours move,
    The cloud-compelling harbinger of Love.


                    XV.

    Here, in this grotto of the wave-worn shore,
    They passed the Tropic's red meridian o'er;
    Nor long the hours--they never paused o'er time,
    Unbroken by the clock's funereal chime,[391]
    Which deals the daily pittance of our span,                        350
    And points and mocks with iron laugh at man.[fn]
    What deemed they of the future or the past?
    The present, like a tyrant, held them fast:
    Their hour-glass was the sea-sand, and the tide,
    Like her smooth billow, saw their moments glide
    Their clock the Sun, in his unbounded tower
    They reckoned not, whose day was but an hour;
    The nightingale, their only vesper-bell,
    Sung sweetly to the rose the day's farewell;[392]
    The broad Sun set, but not with lingering sweep,                   360
    As in the North he mellows o'er the deep;
    But fiery, full, and fierce, as if he left
    The World for ever, earth of light bereft,
    Plunged with red forehead down along the wave,
    As dives a hero headlong to his grave.
    Then rose they, looking first along the skies,
    And then for light into each other's eyes,
    Wondering that Summer showed so brief a sun,
    And asking if indeed the day were done.


                    XVI.

    And let not this seem strange: the devotee                         370
    Lives not in earth, but in his ecstasy;
    Around him days and worlds are heedless driven,
    His Soul is gone before his dust to Heaven.
    Is Love less potent? No--his path is trod,
    Alike uplifted gloriously to God;
    Or linked to all we know of Heaven below,
    The other better self, whose joy or woe
    Is more than ours; the all-absorbing flame
    Which, kindled by another, grows the same,[fo]
    Wrapt in one blaze; the pure, yet funeral pile,                    380
    Where gentle hearts, like Bramins, sit and smile.
    How often we forget all time, when lone,
    Admiring Nature's universal throne,
    Her woods--her wilds--her waters--the intense
    Reply of _hers_ to our intelligence!
    Live not the Stars and Mountains? Are the Waves
    Without a spirit? Are the dropping caves
    Without a feeling in their silent tears?[393]
    No, no;--they woo and clasp us to their spheres,
    Dissolve this clog and clod of clay before                         390
    Its hour, and merge our soul in the great shore.
    Strip off this fond and false identity!--
    Who thinks of self when gazing on the sky?
    And who, though gazing lower, ever thought,
    In the young moments ere the heart is taught
    Time's lesson, of Man's baseness or his own?
    All Nature is his realm, and Love his throne.


                    XVII.

    Neuha arose, and Torquil: Twilight's hour
    Came sad and softly to their rocky bower,
    Which, kindling by degrees its dewy spars,                         400
    Echoed their dim light to the mustering stars.
    Slowly the pair, partaking Nature's calm,
    Sought out their cottage, built beneath the palm;
    Now smiling and now silent, as the scene;
    Lovely as Love--the Spirit!--when serene.
    The Ocean scarce spoke louder with his swell,
    Than breathes his mimic murmurer in the shell,[394]
    As, far divided from his parent deep,
    The sea-born infant cries, and will not sleep,
    Raising his little plaint in vain, to rave                         410
    For the broad bosom of his nursing wave:
    The woods drooped darkly, as inclined to rest,
    The tropic bird wheeled rockward to his nest,
    And the blue sky spread round them like a lake
    Of peace, where Piety her thirst might slake.


                    XVIII.

    But through the palm and plantain, hark, a Voice!
    Not such as would have been a lover's choice,
    In such an hour, to break the air so still;
    No dying night-breeze, harping o'er the hill,
    Striking the strings of nature, rock and tree,                     420
    Those best and earliest lyres of Harmony,
    With Echo for their chorus; nor the alarm
    Of the loud war-whoop to dispel the charm;
    Nor the soliloquy of the hermit owl,
    Exhaling all his solitary soul,
    The dim though large-eyed wingéd anchorite,
    Who peals his dreary Pæan o'er the night;
    But a loud, long, and naval whistle, shrill
    As ever started through a sea-bird's bill;
    And then a pause, and then a hoarse "Hillo!                        430
    Torquil, my boy! what cheer? Ho! brother, ho!"
    "Who hails?" cried Torquil, following with his eye
    The sound. "Here's one," was all the brief reply.



                    XIX.

    But here the herald of the self-same mouth[395]
    Came breathing o'er the aromatic south,
    Not like a "bed of violets" on the gale,
    But such as wafts its cloud o'er grog or ale,
    Borne from a short frail pipe, which yet had blown
    Its gentle odours over either zone,
    And, puffed where'er winds rise or waters roll,                    440
    Had wafted smoke from Portsmouth to the Pole,
    Opposed its vapour as the lightning flashed,
    And reeked, 'midst mountain-billows, unabashed,
    To Æolus a constant sacrifice,
    Through every change of all the varying skies.
    And what was he who bore it?--I may err,
    But deem him sailor or philosopher.[396]
    Sublime Tobacco! which from East to West
    Cheers the tar's labour or the Turkman's rest;
    Which on the Moslem's ottoman divides                              450
    His hours, and rivals opium and his brides;
    Magnificent in Stamboul, but less grand,
    Though not less loved, in Wapping or the Strand;
    Divine in hookas, glorious in a pipe,
    When tipped with amber, mellow, rich, and ripe:
    Like other charmers, wooing the caress,
    More dazzlingly when daring in full dress;
    Yet thy true lovers more admire by far[fp]
    Thy naked beauties--Give me a cigar![397]



                    XX.

    Through the approaching darkness of the wood                       460
    A human figure broke the solitude,
    Fantastically, it may be, arrayed,
    A seaman in a savage masquerade;
    Such as appears to rise out from the deep,
    When o'er the line the merry vessels sweep,
    And the rough Saturnalia of the tar
    Flock o'er the deck, in Neptune's borrowed car;[398]
    And, pleased, the God of Ocean sees his name
    Revive once more, though but in mimic game
    Of his true sons, who riot in the breeze                           470
    Undreamt of in his native Cyclades.
    Still the old God delights, from out the main,
    To snatch some glimpses of his ancient reign.
    Our sailor's jacket, though in ragged trim,
    His constant pipe, which never yet burned dim,
    His foremast air, and somewhat rolling gait,
    Like his dear vessel, spoke his former state;
    But then a sort of kerchief round his head,
    Not over tightly bound, nor nicely spread;
    And, 'stead of trowsers (ah! too early torn!                       480
    For even the mildest woods will have their thorn)
    A curious sort of somewhat scanty mat
    Now served for inexpressibles and hat;
    His naked feet and neck, and sunburnt face,
    Perchance might suit alike with either race.
    His arms were all his own, our Europe's growth,
    Which two worlds bless for civilising both;
    The musket swung behind his shoulders broad,
    And somewhat stooped by his marine abode,
    But brawny as the boar's; and hung beneath,                        490
    His cutlass drooped, unconscious of a sheath,
    Or lost or worn away; his pistols were
    Linked to his belt, a matrimonial pair--
    (Let not this metaphor appear a scoff,
    Though one missed fire, the other would go off);
    These, with a bayonet, not so free from rust
    As when the arm-chest held its brighter trust,
    Completed his accoutrements, as Night
    Surveyed him in his garb heteroclite.


                    XXI.

    "What cheer, Ben Bunting?" cried (when in full view                500
    Our new acquaintance) Torquil. "Aught of new?"
    "Ey, ey!" quoth Ben, "not new, but news enow;
    A strange sail in the offing."--"Sail! and how?
    What! could you make her out? It cannot be;
    I've seen no rag of canvass on the sea."
    "Belike," said Ben, "you might not from the bay,
    But from the bluff-head, where I watched to-day,
    I saw her in the doldrums; for the wind
    Was light and baffling."--"When the Sun declined
    Where lay she? had she anchored?"--"No, but still                  510
    She bore down on us, till the wind grew still."
    "Her flag?"--"I had no glass: but fore and aft,
    Egad! she seemed a wicked-looking craft."
    "Armed?"--"I expect so;--sent on the look-out:
    'Tis time, belike, to put our helm about."
    "About?--Whate'er may have us now in chase,
    We'll make no running fight, for that were base;
    We will die at our quarters, like true men."
    "Ey, ey! for that 'tis all the same to Ben."
    "Does Christian know this?"--"Aye; he has piped all hands          520
    To quarters. They are furbishing the stands
    Of arms; and we have got some guns to bear,
    And scaled them. You are wanted."--"That's but fair;
    And if it were not, mine is not the soul
    To leave my comrades helpless on the shoal.
    My Neuha! ah! and must my fate pursue
    Not me alone, but one so sweet and true?
    But whatsoe'er betide, ah, Neuha! now
    Unman me not: the hour will not allow
    A tear; I am thine whatever intervenes!"                           530
    "Right," quoth Ben; "that will do for the marines."[399]




                             CANTO THE THIRD.


                    I.

    The fight was o'er; the flashing through the gloom,
    Which robes the cannon as he wings a tomb,
    Had ceased; and sulphury vapours upward driven
    Had left the Earth, and but polluted Heaven:
    The rattling roar which rung in every volley
    Had left the echoes to their melancholy;
    No more they shrieked their horror, boom for boom;
    The strife was done, the vanquished had their doom;
    The mutineers were crushed, dispersed, or ta'en,
    Or lived to deem the happiest were the slain.                       10
    Few, few escaped, and these were hunted o'er
    The isle they loved beyond their native shore.
    No further home was theirs, it seemed, on earth,
    Once renegades to that which gave them birth;
    Tracked like wild beasts, like them they sought the wild,
    As to a Mother's bosom flies the child;
    But vainly wolves and lions seek their den,
    And still more vainly men escape from men.


                    II.

    Beneath a rock whose jutting base protrudes
    Far over Ocean in its fiercest moods,                               20
    When scaling his enormous crag the wave
    Is hurled down headlong, like the foremost brave,
    And falls back on the foaming crowd behind,
    Which fight beneath the banners of the wind,
    But now at rest, a little remnant drew
    Together, bleeding, thirsty, faint, and few;
    But still their weapons in their hands, and still
    With something of the pride of former will,
    As men not all unused to meditate,
    And strive much more than wonder at their fate.                     30
    Their present lot was what they had foreseen,
    And dared as what was likely to have been;
    Yet still the lingering hope, which deemed their lot
    Not pardoned, but unsought for or forgot,
    Or trusted that, if sought, their distant caves
    Might still be missed amidst the world of waves,
    Had weaned their thoughts in part from what they saw
    And felt, the vengeance of their country's law.
    Their sea-green isle, their guilt-won Paradise,
    No more could shield their Virtue or their Vice:                    40
    Their better feelings, if such were, were thrown
    Back on themselves,--their sins remained alone.
    Proscribed even in their second country, they
    Were lost; in vain the World before them lay;
    All outlets seemed secured. Their new allies
    Had fought and bled in mutual sacrifice;
    But what availed the club and spear, and arm
    Of Hercules, against the sulphury charm,
    The magic of the thunder, which destroyed
    The warrior ere his strength could be employed?                     50
    Dug, like a spreading pestilence, the grave
    No less of human bravery than the brave![400]
    Their own scant numbers acted all the few
    Against the many oft will dare and do;
    But though the choice seems native to die free,
    Even Greece can boast but one Thermopylæ,
    Till _now_, when she has forged her broken chain
    Back to a sword, and dies and lives again!



                    III.

    Beside the jutting rock the few appeared,
    Like the last remnant of the red-deer's herd;                       60
    Their eyes were feverish, and their aspect worn,
    But still the hunter's blood was on their horn.
    A little stream came tumbling from the height,
    And straggling into ocean as it might,
    Its bounding crystal frolicked in the ray,
    And gushed from cliff to crag with saltless spray;
    Close on the wild, wide ocean, yet as pure
    And fresh as Innocence, and more secure,
    Its silver torrent glittered o'er the deep,
    As the shy chamois' eye o'erlooks the steep,                        70
    While far below the vast and sullen swell
    Of Ocean's alpine azure rose and fell.
    To this young spring they rushed,--all feelings first
    Absorbed in Passion's and in Nature's thirst,--
    Drank as they do who drink their last, and threw
    Their arms aside to revel in its dew;
    Cooled their scorched throats, and washed the gory stains
    From wounds whose only bandage might be chains;
    Then, when their drought was quenched, looked sadly round,
    As wondering how so many still were found                           80
    Alive and fetterless:--but silent all,
    Each sought his fellow's eyes, as if to call
    On him for language which his lips denied,
    As though their voices with their cause had died.


                    IV.

    Stern, and aloof a little from the rest,
    Stood Christian, with his arms across his chest.
    The ruddy, reckless, dauntless hue once spread
    Along his cheek was livid now as lead;
    His light-brown locks, so graceful in their flow,
    Now rose like startled vipers o'er his brow.                        90
    Still as a statue, with his lips comprest
    To stifle even the breath within his breast,
    Fast by the rock, all menacing, but mute,
    He stood; and, save a slight beat of his foot,
    Which deepened now and then the sandy dint
    Beneath his heel, his form seemed turned to flint.
    Some paces further Torquil leaned his head
    Against a bank, and spoke not, but he bled,--
    Not mortally:--his worst wound was within;
    His brow was pale, his blue eyes sunken in,                        100
    And blood-drops, sprinkled o'er his yellow hair,
    Showed that his faintness came not from despair,
    But Nature's ebb. Beside him was another,
    Rough as a bear, but willing as a brother,--
    Ben Bunting, who essayed to wash, and wipe,
    And bind his wound--then calmly lit his pipe,
    A trophy which survived a hundred fights,
    A beacon which had cheered ten thousand nights.
    The fourth and last of this deserted group
    Walked up and down--at times would stand, then stoop               110
    To pick a pebble up--then let it drop--
    Then hurry as in haste--then quickly stop--
    Then cast his eyes on his companions--then
    Half whistle half a tune, and pause again--
    And then his former movements would redouble,
    With something between carelessness and trouble.
    This is a long description, but applies
    To scarce five minutes passed before the eyes;
    But yet _what_ minutes! Moments like to these
    Rend men's lives into immortalities.                               120


                    V.

    At length Jack Skyscrape, a mercurial man,
    Who fluttered over all things like a fan,
    More brave than firm, and more disposed to dare
    And die at once than wrestle with despair,
    Exclaimed, "G--d damn!"--those syllables intense,--
    Nucleus of England's native eloquence,
    As the Turk's "Allah!" or the Roman's more
    Pagan "Proh Jupiter!" was wont of yore
    To give their first impressions such a vent,
    By way of echo to embarrassment.[fq]                               130
    Jack was embarrassed,--never hero more,
    And as he knew not what to say, he swore:
    Nor swore in vain; the long congenial sound
    Revived Ben Bunting from his pipe profound;
    He drew it from his mouth, and looked full wise,
    But merely added to the oath his _eyes_;
    Thus rendering the imperfect phrase complete,
    A peroration I need not repeat.


                    VI.

    But Christian,[401] of a higher order, stood
    Like an extinct volcano in his mood;                               140
    Silent, and sad, and savage,--with the trace
    Of passion reeking from his clouded face;
    Till lifting up again his sombre eye,
    It glanced on Torquil, who leaned faintly by.
    "And is it thus?" he cried, "unhappy boy!
    And thee, too, _thee_--my madness must destroy!"
    He said, and strode to where young Torquil stood,
    Yet dabbled with his lately flowing blood;
    Seized his hand wistfully, but did not press,
    And shrunk as fearful of his own caress;                           150
    Enquired into his state: and when he heard
    The wound was slighter than he deemed or feared,
    A moment's brightness passed along his brow,
    As much as such a moment would allow.
    "Yes," he exclaimed, "we are taken in the toil,
    But not a coward or a common spoil;
    Dearly they have bought us--dearly still may buy,--
    And I must fall; but have _you_ strength to fly?
    'Twould be some comfort still, could you survive;
    Our dwindled band is now too few to strive.                        160
    Oh! for a sole canoe! though but a shell,
    To bear you hence to where a hope may dwell!
    For me, my lot is what I sought; to be,
    In life or death, the fearless and the free."


                    VII.

    Even as he spoke, around the promontory,
    Which nodded o'er the billows high and hoary,
    A dark speck dotted Ocean: on it flew
    Like to the shadow of a roused sea-mew;
    Onward it came--and, lo! a second followed--
    Now seen--now hid--where Ocean's vale was hollowed;                170
    And near, and nearer, till the dusky crew
    Presented well-known aspects to the view,
    Till on the surf their skimming paddles play,
    Buoyant as wings, and flitting through the spray;--
    Now perching on the wave's high curl, and now
    Dashed downward in the thundering foam below,
    Which flings it broad and boiling sheet on sheet,
    And slings its high flakes, shivered into sleet:
    But floating still through surf and swell, drew nigh
    The barks, like small birds through a lowering sky.                180
    Their art seemed nature--such the skill to sweep
    The wave of these born playmates of the deep.


                    VIII.

    And who the first that, springing on the strand,
    Leaped like a Nereid from her shell to land,
    With dark but brilliant skin, and dewy eye
    Shining with love, and hope, and constancy?
    Neuha--the fond, the faithful, the adored--
    Her heart on Torquil's like a torrent poured;
    And smiled, and wept, and near, and nearer clasped,
    As if to be assured 'twas _him_ she grasped;                       190
    Shuddered to see his yet warm wound, and then,
    To find it trivial, smiled and wept again.
    She was a warrior's daughter, and could bear
    Such sights, and feel, and mourn, but not despair.
    Her lover lived,--nor foes nor fears could blight
    That full-blown moment in its all delight:
    Joy trickled in her tears, joy filled the sob
    That rocked her heart till almost heard to throb;
    And Paradise was breathing in the sigh
    Of Nature's child in Nature's ecstasy.                             200


                    IX.

    The sterner spirits who beheld that meeting
    Were not unmoved; who are, when hearts are greeting?
    Even Christian gazed upon the maid and boy
    With tearless eye, but yet a gloomy joy
    Mixed with those bitter thoughts the soul arrays
    In hopeless visions of our better days,
    When all's gone--to the rainbow's latest ray.
    "And but for me!" he said, and turned away;
    Then gazed upon the pair, as in his den
    A lion looks upon his cubs again;                                  210
    And then relapsed into his sullen guise,
    As heedless of his further destinies.


                    X.

    But brief their time for good or evil thought;
    The billows round the promontory brought
    The plash of hostile oars.--Alas! who made
    That sound a dread? All around them seemed arrayed
    Against them, save the bride of Toobonai:
    She, as she caught the first glimpse o'er the bay
    Of the armed boats, which hurried to complete
    The remnant's ruin with their flying feet,[fr]                     220
    Beckoned the natives round her to their prows,
    Embarked their guests and launched their light canoes;
    In one placed Christian and his comrades twain--
    But she and Torquil must not part again.
    She fixed him in her own.--Away! away!
    They cleared the breakers, dart along the bay,
    And towards a group of islets, such as bear
    The sea-bird's nest and seal's surf-hollowed lair,
    They skim the blue tops of the billows; fast
    They flew, and fast their fierce pursuers chased.                  230
    They gain upon them--now they lose again,--
    Again make way and menace o'er the main;
    And now the two canoes in chase divide,
    And follow different courses o'er the tide,
    To baffle the pursuit.--Away! away!
    As Life is on each paddle's flight to-day,
    And more than Life or lives to Neuha: Love
    Freights the frail bark and urges to the cove;
    And now the refuge and the foe are nigh--
    Yet, yet a moment! Fly, thou light ark, fly!                       240




                            CANTO THE FOURTH.


                    I.

    White as a white sail on a dusky sea,
    When half the horizon's clouded and half free,
    Fluttering between the dun wave and the sky,
    Is Hope's last gleam in Man's extremity.
    Her anchor parts; but still her snowy sail
    Attracts our eye amidst the rudest gale:
    Though every wave she climbs divides us more,
    The heart still follows from the loneliest shore.


                    II.

    Not distant from the isle of Toobonai,
    A black rock rears its bosom o'er the spray,                        10
    The haunt of birds, a desert to mankind,
    Where the rough seal reposes from the wind,
    And sleeps unwieldy in his cavern dun,
    Or gambols with huge frolic in the sun:
    There shrilly to the passing oar is heard
    The startled echo of the Ocean bird,
    Who rears on its bare breast her callow brood,
    The feathered fishers of the solitude.
    A narrow segment of the yellow sand
    On one side forms the outline of a strand;[402]                     20
    Here the young turtle, crawling from his shell,
    Steals to the deep wherein his parents dwell;
    Chipped by the beam, a nursling of the day,
    But hatched for ocean by the fostering ray;
    The rest was one bleak precipice, as e'er
    Gave mariners a shelter and despair;
    A spot to make the saved regret the deck
    Which late went down, and envy the lost wreck.
    Such was the stern asylum Neuha chose
    To shield her lover from his following foes;                        30
    But all its secret was not told; she knew
    In this a treasure hidden from the view.


                    III.

    Ere the canoes divided, near the spot,
    The men that manned what held her Torquil's lot,
    By her command removed, to strengthen more
    The skiff which wafted Christian from the shore.
    This he would have opposed; but with a smile
    She pointed calmly to the craggy isle,
    And bade him "speed and prosper." _She_ would take
    The rest upon herself for Torquil's sake.                           40
    They parted with this added aid; afar,
    The Proa darted like a shooting star,
    And gained on the pursuers, who now steered
    Right on the rock which she and Torquil neared.
    They pulled; her arm, though delicate, was free
    And firm as ever grappled with the sea,
    And yielded scarce to Torquil's manlier strength.
    The prow now almost lay within its length
    Of the crag's steep inexorable face,
    With nought but soundless waters for its base;                      50
    Within a hundred boats' length was the foe,
    And now what refuge but their frail canoe?
    This Torquil asked with half upbraiding eye,
    Which said--"Has Neuha brought me here to die?
    Is this a place of safety, or a grave,
    And yon huge rock the tombstone of the wave?"


                    IV.

    They rested on their paddles, and uprose
    Neuha, and pointing to the approaching foes,
    Cried, "Torquil, follow me, and fearless follow!"
    Then plunged at once into the Ocean's hollow.                       60
    There was no time to pause--the foes were near--
    Chains in his eye, and menace in his ear;
    With vigour they pulled on, and as they came,
    Hailed him to yield, and by his forfeit name.
    Headlong he leapt--to him the swimmer's skill
    Was native, and now all his hope from ill:
    But how, or where? He dived, and rose no more;
    The boat's crew looked amazed o'er sea and shore.
    There was no landing on that precipice,
    Steep, harsh, and slippery as a berg of ice.                        70
    They watched awhile to see him float again,
    But not a trace rebubbled from the main:
    The wave rolled on, no ripple on its face,
    Since their first plunge recalled a single trace;
    The little whirl which eddied, and slight foam,
    That whitened o'er what seemed their latest home,
    White as a sepulchre above the pair
    Who left no marble (mournful as an heir)
    The quiet Proa wavering o'er the tide
    Was all that told of Torquil and his bride;                         80
    And but for this alone the whole might seem
    The vanished phantom of a seaman's dream.
    They paused and searched in vain, then pulled away;
    Even Superstition now forbade their stay.
    Some said he had not plunged into the wave,
    But vanished like a corpse-light from a grave;
    Others, that something supernatural
    Glared in his figure, more than mortal tall;
    While all agreed that in his cheek and eye
    There was a dead hue of Eternity.                                   90
    Still as their oars receded from the crag,
    Round every weed a moment would they lag,
    Expectant of some token of their prey;
    But no--he had melted from them like the spray.


                    V.

    And where was he the Pilgrim of the Deep,
    Following the Nereid? Had they ceased to weep
    For ever? or, received in coral caves,
    Wrung life and pity from the softening waves?
    Did they with Ocean's hidden sovereigns dwell,
    And sound with Mermen the fantastic shell?                         100
    Did Neuha with the mermaids comb her hair
    Flowing o'er ocean as it streamed in air?
    Or had they perished, and in silence slept
    Beneath the gulf wherein they boldly leapt?


                    VI.

    Young Neuha plunged into the deep, and he
    Followed: her track beneath her native sea
    Was as a native's of the element,
    So smoothly--bravely--brilliantly she went,
    Leaving a streak of light behind her heel,
    Which struck and flashed like an amphibious steel,                 110
    Closely, and scarcely less expert to trace
    The depths where divers hold the pearl in chase,
    Torquil, the nursling of the northern seas,
    Pursued her liquid steps with heart and ease.
    Deep--deeper for an instant Neuha led
    The way--then upward soared--and as she spread
    Her arms, and flung the foam from off her locks,
    Laughed, and the sound was answered by the rocks.
    They had gained a central realm of earth again,
    But looked for tree, and field, and sky, in vain.                  120
    Around she pointed to a spacious cave,
    Whose only portal was the keyless wave,[403]
    (A hollow archway by the sun unseen,
    Save through the billows' glassy veil of green,
    In some transparent ocean holiday,
    When all the finny people are at play,)
    Wiped with her hair the brine from Torquil's eyes,
    And clapped her hands with joy at his surprise;
    Led him to where the rock appeared to jut,
    And form a something like a Triton's hut;                          130
    For all was darkness for a space, till day,
    Through clefts above let in a sobered ray;
    As in some old cathedral's glimmering aisle
    The dusty monuments from light recoil,
    Thus sadly in their refuge submarine
    The vault drew half her shadow from the scene.



                    VII.

    Forth from her bosom the young savage drew
    A pine torch, strongly girded with gnatoo;
    A plantain-leaf o'er all, the more to keep
    Its latent sparkle from the sapping deep.                          140
    This mantle kept it dry; then from a nook
    Of the same plantain-leaf a flint she took,
    A few shrunk withered twigs, and from the blade
    Of Torquil's knife struck fire, and thus arrayed
    The grot with torchlight. Wide it was and high,
    And showed a self-born Gothic canopy;
    The arch upreared by Nature's architect,
    The architrave some Earthquake might erect;
    The buttress from some mountain's bosom hurled,
    When the Poles crashed, and water was the world;                   150
    Or hardened from some earth-absorbing fire,
    While yet the globe reeked from its funeral pyre;
    The fretted pinnacle, the aisle, the nave,[404]
    Were there, all scooped by Darkness from her cave.
    There, with a little tinge of phantasy,
    Fantastic faces moped and mowed on high,
    And then a mitre or a shrine would fix
    The eye upon its seeming crucifix.
    Thus Nature played with the stalactites,[405]
    And built herself a Chapel of the Seas.                            160



                    VIII.

    And Neuha took her Torquil by the hand,
    And waved along the vault her kindled brand,
    And led him into each recess, and showed
    The secret places of their new abode.
    Nor these alone, for all had been prepared
    Before, to soothe the lover's lot she shared:
    The mat for rest; for dress the fresh gnatoo,
    And sandal oil to fence against the dew;
    For food the cocoa-nut, the yam, the bread
    Born of the fruit; for board the plantain spread                   170
    With its broad leaf, or turtle-shell which bore
    A banquet in the flesh it covered o'er;
    The gourd with water recent from the rill,
    The ripe banana from the mellow hill;
    A pine-torch pile to keep undying light,
    And she herself, as beautiful as night,
    To fling her shadowy spirit o'er the scene,
    And make their subterranean world serene.
    She had foreseen, since first the stranger's sail
    Drew to their isle, that force or flight might fail,               180
    And formed a refuge of the rocky den
    For Torquil's safety from his countrymen.[fs]
    Each dawn had wafted there her light canoe,
    Laden with all the golden fruits that grew;
    Each eve had seen her gliding through the hour
    With all could cheer or deck their sparry bower;
    And now she spread her little store with smiles,
    The happiest daughter of the loving isles.


                    IX.

    She, as he gazed with grateful wonder, pressed
    Her sheltered love to her impassioned breast;                      190
    And suited to her soft caresses, told
    An olden tale of Love,--for Love is old,
    Old as eternity, but not outworn
    With each new being born or to be born:[406]
    How a young Chief, a thousand moons ago,
    Diving for turtle in the depths below,
    Had risen, in tracking fast his ocean prey,
    Into the cave which round and o'er them lay;
    How, in some desperate feud of after-time,
    He sheltered there a daughter of the clime,                        200
    A foe beloved, and offspring of a foe,
    Saved by his tribe but for a captive's woe;
    How, when the storm of war was stilled, he led
    His island clan to where the waters spread
    Their deep-green shadow o'er the rocky door,
    Then dived--it seemed as if to rise no more:
    His wondering mates, amazed within their bark,
    Or deemed him mad, or prey to the blue shark;
    Rowed round in sorrow the sea-girded rock,
    Then paused upon their paddles from the shock;                     210
    When, fresh and springing from the deep, they saw
    A Goddess rise--so deemed they in their awe;
    And their companion, glorious by her side,
    Proud and exulting in his Mermaid bride;
    And how, when undeceived, the pair they bore
    With sounding conchs and joyous shouts to shore;
    How they had gladly lived and calmly died,--
    And why not also Torquil and his bride?
    Not mine to tell the rapturous caress
    Which followed wildly in that wild recess                          220
    This tale; enough that all within that cave
    Was love, though buried strong as in the grave,
    Where Abelard, through twenty years of death,
    When Eloïsa's form was lowered beneath
    Their nuptial vault, his arms outstretched, and pressed
    The kindling ashes to his kindled breast.[407]
    The waves without sang round their couch, their roar
    As much unheeded as if life were o'er;
    Within, their hearts made all their harmony,
    Love's broken murmur and more broken sigh.                         230


                    X.

    And they, the cause and sharers of the shock
    Which left them exiles of the hollow rock,
    Where were they? O'er the sea for life they plied,
    To seek from Heaven the shelter men denied.
    Another course had been their choice--but where?
    The wave which bore them still their foes would bear,
    Who, disappointed of their former chase,
    In search of Christian now renewed their race.
    Eager with anger, their strong arms made way,
    Like vultures baffled of their previous prey.                      240
    They gained upon them, all whose safety lay
    In some bleak crag or deeply-hidden bay:
    No further chance or choice remained; and right
    For the first further rock which met their sight
    They steered, to take their latest view of land,
    And yield as victims, or die sword in hand;
    Dismissed the natives and their shallop, who
    Would still have battled for that scanty crew;
    But Christian bade them seek their shore again,
    Nor add a sacrifice which were in vain;                            250
    For what were simple bow and savage spear
    Against the arms which must be wielded here?



                    XI.

    They landed on a wild but narrow scene,
    Where few but Nature's footsteps yet had been;
    Prepared their arms, and with that gloomy eye,
    Stern and sustained, of man's extremity,
    When Hope is gone, nor Glory's self remains
    To cheer resistance against death or chains.--
    They stood, the three, as the three hundred stood
    Who dyed Thermopylæ with holy blood.                              260
    But, ah! how different! 'tis the _cause_ makes all,
    Degrades or hallows courage in its fall.
    O'er them no fame, eternal and intense,
    Blazed through the clouds of Death and beckoned hence;
    No grateful country, smiling through her tears,
    Begun the praises of a thousand years;
    No nation's eyes would on their tomb be bent,
    No heroes envy them their monument;
    However boldly their warm blood was spilt,
    Their Life was shame, their Epitaph was guilt.                     270
    And this they knew and felt, at least the one,
    The leader of the band he had undone;
    Who, born perchance for better things, had set
    His life upon a cast which lingered yet:
    But now the die was to be thrown, and all
    The chances were in favour of his fall:
    And such a fall! But still he faced the shock,
    Obdurate as a portion of the rock
    Whereon he stood, and fixed his levelled gun,
    Dark as a sullen cloud before the sun.                             280


                    XII.

    The boat drew nigh, well armed, and firm the crew
    To act whatever Duty bade them do;
    Careless of danger, as the onward wind
    Is of the leaves it strews, nor looks behind.
    And, yet, perhaps, they rather wished to go
    Against a nation's than a native foe,
    And felt that this poor victim of self-will,
    Briton no more, had once been Britain's still.
    They hailed him to surrender--no reply;
    Their arms were poised, and glittered in the sky.                  290
    They hailed again--no answer; yet once more
    They offered quarter louder than before.
    The echoes only, from the rock's rebound,
    Took their last farewell of the dying sound.
    Then flashed the flint, and blazed the volleying flame,
    And the smoke rose between them and their aim,
    While the rock rattled with the bullets' knell,
    Which pealed in vain, and flattened as they fell;
    Then flew the only answer to be given
    By those who had lost all hope in earth or heaven.                 300
    After the first fierce peal as they pulled nigher,
    They heard the voice of Christian shout, "Now, fire!"
    And ere the word upon the echo died,
    Two fell; the rest assailed the rock's rough side,
    And, furious at the madness of their foes,
    Disdained all further efforts, save to close.
    But steep the crag, and all without a path,
    Each step opposed a bastion to their wrath,
    While, placed 'midst clefts the least accessible,
    Which Christian's eye was trained to mark full well,               310
    The three maintained a strife which must not yield,
    In spots where eagles might have chosen to build.
    Their every shot told; while the assailant fell,
    Dashed on the shingles like the limpet shell;
    But still enough survived, and mounted still,
    Scattering their numbers here and there, until
    Surrounded and commanded, though not nigh
    Enough for seizure, near enough to die,
    The desperate trio held aloof their fate
    But by a thread, like sharks who have gorged the bait;             320
    Yet to the very last they battled well,
    And not a groan informed their foes _who_ fell.
    Christian died last--twice wounded; and once more
    Mercy was offered when they saw his gore;
    Too late for life, but not too late to die,[ft]
    With, though a hostile hand, to close his eye.
    A limb was broken, and he drooped along
    The crag, as doth a falcon reft of young.[fu]
    The sound revived him, or appeared to wake
    Some passion which a weakly gesture spake:                         330
    He beckoned to the foremost, who drew nigh,
    But, as they neared, he reared his weapon high--
    His last ball had been aimed, but from his breast
    He tore the topmost button from his vest,[408][fv]
    Down the tube dashed it--levelled--fired, and smiled
    As his foe fell; then, like a serpent, coiled
    His wounded, weary form, to where the steep
    Looked desperate as himself along the deep;
    Cast one glance back, and clenched his hand, and shook
    His last rage 'gainst the earth which he forsook;                  340
    Then plunged: the rock below received like glass
    His body crushed into one gory mass,
    With scarce a shred to tell of human form,
    Or fragment for the sea-bird or the worm;
    A fair-haired scalp, besmeared with blood and weeds,
    Yet reeked, the remnant of himself and deeds;
    Some splinters of his weapons (to the last,
    As long as hand could hold, he held them fast)
    Yet glittered, but at distance--hurled away
    To rust beneath the dew and dashing spray.                         350
    The rest was nothing--save a life mis-spent,
    And soul--but who shall answer where it went?
    'Tis ours to bear, not judge the dead; and they
    Who doom to Hell, themselves are on the way,
    Unless these bullies of eternal pains
    Are pardoned their bad hearts for their worse brains.



                    XIII.

    The deed was over! All were gone or ta'en,
    The fugitive, the captive, or the slain.
    Chained on the deck, where once, a gallant crew,
    They stood with honour, were the wretched few                      360
    Survivors of the skirmish on the isle;
    But the last rock left no surviving spoil.
    Cold lay they where they fell, and weltering,
    While o'er them flapped the sea-birds' dewy wing,
    Now wheeling nearer from the neighbouring surge,
    And screaming high their harsh and hungry dirge:
    But calm and careless heaved the wave below,
    Eternal with unsympathetic flow;
    Far o'er its face the Dolphins sported on,
    And sprung the flying fish against the sun,                        370
    Till its dried wing relapsed from its brief height,
    To gather moisture for another flight.


                    XIV.

    'Twas morn; and Neuha, who by dawn of day
    Swam smoothly forth to catch the rising ray,
    And watch if aught approached the amphibious lair
    Where lay her lover, saw a sail in air:
    It flapped, it filled, and to the growing gale
    Bent its broad arch: her breath began to fail
    With fluttering fear, her heart beat thick and high,
    While yet a doubt sprung where its course might lie.               380
    But no! it came not; fast and far away
    The shadow lessened as it cleared the bay.
    She gazed, and flung the sea-foam from her eyes,
    To watch as for a rainbow in the skies.
    On the horizon verged the distant deck,
    Diminished, dwindled to a very speck--
    Then vanished. All was Ocean, all was Joy!
    Down plunged she through the cave to rouse her boy;
    Told all she had seen, and all she hoped, and all
    That happy love could augur or recall;                             390
    Sprung forth again, with Torquil following free
    His bounding Nereid over the broad sea;
    Swam round the rock, to where a shallow cleft
    Hid the canoe that Neuha there had left
    Drifting along the tide, without an oar,
    That eve the strangers chased them from the shore;
    But when these vanished, she pursued her prow,
    Regained, and urged to where they found it now:
    Nor ever did more love and joy embark,
    Than now were wafted in that slender ark.                          400


                    XV.

    Again their own shore rises on the view,
    No more polluted with a hostile hue;
    No sullen ship lay bristling o'er the foam,
    A floating dungeon:--all was Hope and Home!
    A thousand Proas darted o'er the bay,
    With sounding shells, and heralded their way;
    The chiefs came down, around the people poured,
    And welcomed Torquil as a son restored;
    The women thronged, embracing and embraced
    By Neuha, asking where they had been chased,                       410
    And how escaped? The tale was told; and then
    One acclamation rent the sky again;
    And from that hour a new tradition gave
    Their sanctuary the name of "Neuha's Cave."
    A hundred fires, far flickering from the height,[fw]
    Blazed o'er the general revel of the night,
    The feast in honour of the guest, returned
    To Peace and Pleasure, perilously earned;
    A night succeeded by such happy days
    As only the yet infant world displays.[fx]                         420

[352] [William Bligh, the son of Cornish parents, was born September 9
1754 (? 1753). He served under Cook in his second voyage in the
_Resolution_, 1772-75, as sailing-master; and, in 1782, fought under
Lord Howe at Gibraltar. He married a daughter of William Betham, first
collector of customs in the Isle of Man, and hence his connection with
Fletcher Christian, who belonged to a Manx family, and the midshipman
Peter Hayward, who was the son of a Deemster. He was appointed to the
_Bounty_ in December, 1787, and in 1791 to the _Providence_, which was
despatched to the Society Islands to obtain a fresh cargo of bread-fruit
trees in place of those which were thrown overboard by the mutineers. He
commanded the _Glatton_ at Copenhagen, May 21, 1801, and on that and
other occasions served with distinction. He was made Governor of New
South Wales in 1805, but was forcibly deposed in an insurrection headed
by Major Johnston, January, 1808. He was kept in prison till 1810, but
on his return to England his administration of his office was approved,
and Johnston was cashiered. He was advanced to the rank of Vice-Admiral
of the Blue in 1814, and died, December 7, 1817.

In his _Narrative_ Bligh describes the mutiny as "a close-planned act of
villainy," and attributes the conspiracy not to his own harshness, or to
disloyalty provoked by "real or imaginary grievances," but to the
contrast of life on board ship, "in ever climbing up the climbing wave,"
with the unearned luxuries of Tahiti, "the allurements of dissipation
... the female connections," which the sailors had left behind. Besides
his own apology, there are the sworn statements of the two midshipmen,
Hayward and Hallet, and others, which Bligh published in answer to a
pamphlet which Edward Christian, afterwards Chief Justice of Ely, wrote
in defence of his brother Fletcher. The evidence against Bligh is
contained in the MS. journal of the boatswain's mate, James Morrison,
which was saved, as by a miracle, from the wreck of the _Pandora_, and
is quoted by Sir John Barrow, Lady Belcher, and other authorities. There
is, too, the testimony of John Adams (Alexander Smith), as recorded by
Captain Beachey, and, as additional proof of indifference and tyrannical
behaviour, there are Bligh's own letters to Peter Hayward's mother and
uncle (March 26, April 2, 1790), and W. C. Wentworth's account of his
administration as Governor of New South Wales (see _A Statistical
Description_, etc., 1819, p. 166). It cannot be gainsaid that Bligh was
a man of integrity and worth, and that he was upheld and esteemed by the
Admiralty. Morrison's Journal, though in parts corroborated by Bligh's
MS. Journal, is not altogether convincing, and the testimony of John
Adams in his old age counts for little. But according to his own
supporters he "damned" his men though not the officers, and his own
_Narrative_, as well as Morrison's Journal, proves that he was
suspicious, and that he underrated and misunderstood the character and
worth of his subordinates. He was responsible for the prolonged sojourn
at Tahiti, and he should have remembered that time and distance are
powerful solvents, and that between Portsmouth Hard and the untracked
waters of the Pacific, "all Arcadia" had intervened. He was a man of
imperfect sympathies, wanting in tact and fineness, but in the hour of
need he behaved like a hero, and saved himself and others by submission
to duty and strenuous self-control. Moreover, he "helped England" not
once or twice, "in the brave days of old." (See _A_ _Narrative, etc._,

flattering. I had a ship in the most perfect order, and well stored with
every necessary, both for service and health; ... the voyage was two
thirds completed, and the remaining part in a very promising way."--_A
Narrative of the Mutiny, etc._, by Lieut. W. Bligh, 1790, p. 9.]

[354] ["The women at Otaheite are handsome, mild, and cheerful in their
manners and conversation, possessed of great sensibility, and have
sufficient delicacy to make them admired and beloved. The chiefs were so
much attached to our people, that they rather encouraged their stay
among them than otherwise, and even made them promises of large
possessions. Under these and many other attendant circumstances equally
desirable, it is now, perhaps, not so much to be wondered at ... that a
set of sailors, most of them void of connections, should be led away,
especially when they imagined it in their power to fix themselves, in
the midst of plenty, ... on the finest island in the world, where they
need not labour, and where the allurements of dissipation are beyond
anything that can be conceived,"--_Ibid._, p. 10.]

[355] {591}["Just before sunrising Mr. Christian, with the
master-at-arms, gunner's mate, and Thomas Burkitt, seaman, came into my
cabin while I was asleep, and, seizing me, tied my hands with a cord
behind my back, and threatened me with instant death if I spoke or made
the least noise. I, however, called out so loud as to alarm every one;
but they had already secured the officers who were not of their party,
by placing sentinels at their doors. There were three men at my cabin
door, besides the four within; Christian had only a cutlass in his hand,
the others had muskets and bayonets. I was hauled out of bed, and forced
on deck in my shirt, suffering great pain from the tightness with which
they had tied my hands.... The boatswain was now ordered to hoist the
launch out. The boat being hoisted out, Mr. Hayward and Mr. Hallet,
midshipmen, were ordered into it; upon which I demanded the cause of
such an order, and endeavoured to persuade some one to a sense of duty;
but it was to no effect: 'Hold your tongue, sir, or you are dead this
instant,' was constantly repeated to me."--_A Narrative of the Mutiny,
etc._, by Lieut. W. Bligh, 1790, pp. 1, 2.]

[356] ["The boatswain, and seamen who were to go in the boat, were
allowed to collect twine, canvass, lines, sails, cordage, an
eight-and-twenty-gallon cask of water, and the carpenter to take his
tool-chest. Mr. Samuel got one hundred and fifty pounds of bread with a
small quantity of rum and wine ... also a quadrant and
compass."--_Ibid._, p. 3.]

[357] {592}["The mutineers now hurried those they meant to get rid of
into the boat, ... Christian directed a dram to be served to each of his
own crew."--_A Narrative, etc._, 1790, p. 3.]

[358] [It was Johnson, not Burke, who upheld the claims of brandy.--"He
was persuaded," says Boswell, "to drink one glass of it [claret]. He
shook his head, and said, 'Poor stuff!--No, Sir, claret is the liquor
for boys; port for men; but he who aspires to be a hero (smiling) must
drink brandy.'"--Boswell's _Life of Johnson_, 1848, p. 627.]

[359] ["While the ship ... was in sight she steered to the W.N.W., but I
considered this only a feint; for when we were sent away, 'Huzza for
Otaheite!' was frequently heard among the mutineers."--_A Narrative,
etc._, 1790, pp. 4-8. This statement is questioned by Sir John Barrow
(_The Eventful History, etc._, 1831, p. 91), on the grounds that the
mutiny was the result of a sudden determination on the part of
Christian, and that liberty, and not the delights of Tahiti, was the
object which the mutineers had in view.]

[361] ["Isaac Martin, one of the guard over me, I saw, had an
inclination to assist me; and as he fed me with shaddock (my lips being
quite parched with my endeavours to bring about a change), we explained
our wishes to each other by our looks; but this being observed, Martin
was instantly removed from me."--_A Narrative, etc._, 1790, p. 4.]

[362] {594}["Christian ... then ... said, 'Come, Captain Bligh, your
officers and men are now in the boat; and you must go with them; if you
attempt to make the least resistance you will instantly be put to
death;' and without any farther ceremony, holding me by the cord that
tied my hands, with a tribe of armed ruffians about me, I was forced
over the side, where they untied my hands. Being in the boat, we were
veered astern by a rope. A few pieces of pork were thrown to me and some
clothes.... After having undergone a great deal of ridicule, and being
kept for some time to make sport for these unfeeling wretches, we were
at length cast adrift in the open ocean.... When they were forcing me
out of the ship, I asked him [Christian] if this treatment was a proper
return for the many instances he had received of my friendship? He
appeared disturbed at the question, and answered, with much emotion,
'That,--Captain Bligh,--that is the thing;--I am in hell--I am in
hell.'"--_A Narrative, etc._, 1790, pp. 4-8.

Bligh's testimony on this point does not correspond with Morrison's
journal, or with the evidence of the master, John Fryer, given at the
court-martial, September 12, 1792. According to Morrison, when the
boatswain tried to pacify Christian, he replied, "It is too late, I have
been in hell for this fortnight past, and am determined to bear it no
longer." The master's version is that he appealed to Christian, and that
Christian exclaimed, "Hold your tongue, sir, I have been in hell for
weeks past; Captain Bligh has brought all this on himself." Bligh seems
to have flattered himself that in the act of mutiny Christian was seized
with remorse, but it is clear that the wish was father to the thought.
Moreover, on being questioned, Fryer, who was a supporter of the
captain, explained that Christian referred to quarrels, to abuse in
general, and more particularly to a recent accusation of stealing
cocoa-nuts. (See _The Eventful History_, etc., 1831, pp. 84, 208, 209.)]

when the launch reached Timor, he speaks of the crew as "so many
spectres, whose ghastly countenances, if the cause had been unknown,
would have excited terror rather than pity."]

["Whilst we were talking of _Vaváoo tóoa Lico_, the women said to us,
'Let us repair to the back of the island to contemplate the setting sun:
there let us listen to the warbling of the birds, and the cooing of the
wood-pigeon. We will gather flowers from the burying-place at _Matáwto_,
and partake of refreshments prepared for us at _Lico O'nĕ_: we will
then bathe in the sea, and rinse ourselves in the _Váoo A'ca_; we will
anoint our skins in the sun with sweet-scented oil, and will plait in
wreaths the flowers gathered at _Matáwto_.' And now as we stand
motionless on the eminence over _Anoo Mánoo_, the whistling of the wind
among the branches of the lofty _toa_ shall fill us with a pleasing
melancholy; or our minds shall be seized with astonishment as we behold
the roaring surf below, endeavouring but in vain to tear away the firm
rocks. Oh! how much happier shall we be thus employed, than when engaged
in the troublesome and insipid cares of life!

"Now as night comes on, we must return to the _Moóa_. But hark!--hear
you not the sound of the mats?--they are practising a _bo-oóla_ ['a kind
of dance performed by torch-light'], to be performed to-night on the
_malái_, at _Tanéa_. Let us also go there. How will that scene of
rejoicing call to our minds the many festivals held there, before
_Vavdoo_ was torn to pieces by war! Alas! how destructive is war!
Behold! how it has rendered the land productive of weeds, and opened
untimely graves for departed heroes! Our chiefs can now no longer enjoy
the sweet pleasure of wandering alone by moonlight in search of their
mistresses. But let us banish sorrow from our hearts: since we are at
war, we must think and act like the natives of _Fiji_, who first taught
us this destructive art. Let us therefore enjoy the present time, for
to-morrow perhaps, or the next day, we may die. We will dress ourselves
with _chi coola_, and put bands of white _táppa_ round our waists. We
will plait thick wreaths of _jiale_ for our heads, and prepare strings
of _hooni_ for our necks, that their whiteness may show off the colour
of our skins. Mark how the uncultivated spectators are profuse of their
applause! But now the dance is over: let us remain here to-night and
feast and be cheerful, and to-morrow we will depart for the Mooa. How
troublesome are the young men, begging for our wreaths of flowers! while
they say in their flattery, 'See how charming these young girls look
coming from _Licoo_!--how beautiful are their skins, diffusing around a
fragrance like the flowering precipice of _Mataloco_:--Let us also visit
_Licoo_. We will depart to-morrow.'"--_An Account of the Natives of the

[374] [Cava, "kava," or "ava," is an intoxicating drink, prepared from
the roots and stems of a kind of pepper (_Piper methysticum_). Mariner
(_An Account, etc._, 1817, ii. 183-206) gives a highly interesting and
suggestive account of the process of brewing the kava, and of the solemn
"kava-drinking," which was attended with ceremonial rites. Briefly, a
large wooden bowl, about three feet in diameter, and one foot in depth
in the centre (see, for a typical specimen, King Thakombau's kava-bowl,
in the British Museum), is placed in front of the king or chief, who
sits in the midst, surrounded by his guests and courtiers. A portion of
kava root is handed to each person present, who chews it to a pulp, and
then deposits his quid in the kava bowl. Water being gradually added,
the roots are well squeezed and twisted by various "curvilinear turns"
of the hands and arms through the "fow," _i.e._ shavings of fibrous
bark. When the "kava is in the cup," quaighs made of the "unexpanded
leaf of the banana" are handed round to the guests, and the symposium
begins. Mariner (_ibid._, p. 205, note) records a striking feature of
the preliminary rites, a consecration or symbolic "grace before"
drinking. "When a god has no priest, as Tali-y-Toobó [the Supreme Deity
of the Tongans], no person ... presides at the head of his cava circle,
the place being left ... vacant, but which it is supposed the god
invisibly occupies.... And they go through the usual form of words, as
if the first cup was actually filled and presented to the god: thus,
before any cup is filled, the man by the side of the bowl says ... 'The
cava is in the cup:' the mataboole answers ... 'Give it to our god:' but
this is mere form, for there is no cup filled for the god." (See, too,

of the Sun have either perished or remain prisoners expecting our
clemency."]

[381] {605}[George Stewart was born at Ronaldshay (circ. 1764), but was
living at Stromness in 1780 (where his father's house, "The White
House," is still shown), when, on the homeward voyage of the Resolution,
Cook and Bligh were hospitably entertained by his parents. He was of
honourable descent. His mother's ancestors were sprung from a
half-brother of Mary Stuart's, and his father's family dated back to
1400. When he was at Timor, Bligh gave a "description of the pirates"
for purposes of identification by the authorities at Calcutta and
elsewhere. "George Stewart, midshipman, aged 23 years, is five feet
seven inches high, good complexion, dark hair, slender made ... small
face, and black eyes; tatowed on the left breast with a star," etc.
Lieutenant Bligh took Stewart with him, partly in return for the
"civilities" at Stromness, but also because "he was a seaman, and had
always borne a good character." Alexander Smith told Captain Beachey
(_Narrative of a Voyage to the Pacific_, 1831, Part I. p. 53) that it
was Stewart who advised Christian "to take possession of the ship," but
Peter Hayward, who survived to old age, strenuously maintained that this
was a calumny, that Stewart was forcibly detained in his cabin, and that
he would not, in any case, have taken part in the mutiny. He had,
perhaps, already wooed and won a daughter of the isles, and when the
_Bounty_ revisited Tahiti, September 20, 1789, he was put ashore, and
took up his quarters in her father's house. There he remained till
March, 1791, when he "voluntarily surrendered himself" to the captain of
the _Pandora_, and was immediately put in irons. The story of his
parting from his bride is told in _A Missionary Voyage to the Southern
Pacific Ocean in the Ship Duff_ (by W. Wilson), 1799, p. 360: "The
history of Peggy Stewart marks a tenderness of heart that never will be
heard without emotion.... They had lived with the old chief in the most
tender state of endearment; a beautiful little girl had been the fruit
of their union, and was at the breast when the Pandora arrived....
Frantic with grief, the unhappy Peggy ... flew with her infant in a
canoe to the arms of her husband. She was separated from him by
violence, and conveyed on shore in a state of despair and grief too big
for utterance ... she sank into the deepest dejection, pined under a
rapid decay ... and fell a victim to her feelings, dying literally of a
broken heart." Stewart was drowned or killed by an accident during the
wreck of the _Pandora_, August 29, 1791. _Sunt lacrymæ rerum!_ It is a
mournful tale.]

[385] The consul Nero, who made the unequalled march which deceived
Hannibal, and defeated Asdrubal; thereby accomplishing an achievement
almost unrivalled in military annals. The first intelligence of his
return, to Hannibal, was the sight of Asdrubal's head thrown into his
camp. When Hannibal saw this, he exclaimed with a sigh, that "Rome would
now be the mistress of the world." And yet to this victory of Nero's it
might be owing that his imperial namesake reigned at all. But the infamy
of one has eclipsed the glory of the other. When the name of "Nero" is
heard, who thinks of the consul?--But such are human things! [For

[388] When very young, about eight years of age, after an attack of the
scarlet fever at Aberdeen, I was removed by medical advice into the
Highlands. Here I passed occasionally some summers, and from this period
I date my love of mountainous countries. I can never forget the effect,
a few years afterwards, in England, of the only thing I had long seen,
even in miniature, of a mountain, in the Malvern Hills. After I returned
to Cheltenham, I used to watch them every afternoon, at sunset, with a
sensation which I cannot describe. This was boyish enough: but I was
then only thirteen years of age, and it was in the holidays. [Byron
spent his summer holidays, 1796-98, at the farm-house of Ballatrich, on
Deeside. (See _Poetical Works_, 1898, i. 192, note 2. For his visit to
Cheltenham, in the summer of 1801, see _Life_, pp. 8, 19.)

[394] {613} If the reader will apply to his ear the sea-shell on his
chimney-piece, he will be aware of what is alluded to. If the text
should appear obscure, he will find in _Gebir_ the same idea better
expressed in two lines. The poem I never read, but have heard the lines
quoted, by a more recondite reader--who seems to be of a different
opinion from the editor of the _Quarterly Review_, who qualified it in
his answer to the Critical Reviewer of his _Juvenal_, as trash of the
worst and most insane description. It is to Mr. Landor, the author of
_Gebir_, so qualified, and of some Latin poems, which vie with Martial
or Catullus in obscenity, that the immaculate Mr. Southey addresses his
declamation against impurity!

[These are the lines in _Gebir_ to which Byron alludes--

    "But I have sinuous shells of pearly hue.

           *       *       *       *       *

    Shake one and it awakens; then apply
    Its polisht lips to your attentive ear,
    And it remembers its august abodes,
    And murmurs as the ocean murmurs there."

Compare, too, _The Excursion_, bk. iv.--

                           "I have seen
    A curious child, who dwelt upon a tract
    Of inland ground, applying to his ear
    The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell,
    To which, in silence hushed, his very soul
    Listened intently," etc.

Landor, in his _Satire upon Satirists_, 1836, p. 29, commenting on
Wordsworth's alleged remark that he "would not give five shillings for
all the poetry that Southey had written" (see _Letters_, 1900, iv.
Appendix IX. pp. 483, 484), calls attention to this unacknowledged
borrowing, "It would have been honester," he says, "and more decorous if
the writer of the following verses had mentioned from what bar he drew
his wire." According to H. C. Robinson (_Diary_, 1869, iii. 114),
Wordsworth acknowledged no obligation to Landor's _Gebir_ for the image
of the sea-shell. "From his childhood the shell was familiar to him,
etc. The 'Satire' seemed to give Wordsworth little annoyance."]

[395] {615}[In his Preface to Cantos I., II. of _Childe Harold_
(_Poetical Works_, 1899, ii. 5), Byron relies on the authority of
"Ariosto Thomson and Beattie" for the inclusion of droll or satirical
"variations" in a serious poem. Nevertheless, Dallas prevailed on him to
omit certain "ludicrous stanzas." It is to be regretted that no one
suggested the excision of sections xix.-xxi. from the second canto of
The Island.]

[396] Hobbes, the father of Locke's and other philosophy, was an
inveterate smoker,--even to pipes beyond computation.

["Soon after dinner he [Hobbes] retired to his study, and had his
candle, with ten or twelve pipes of tobacco laid by him; then, shutting
his door, he fell to smoking, and thinking, and writing for several
hours."--_Memoirs of the Family of Cavendish_, by White Kennet, D.D.,

[398] {616} This rough but jovial ceremony, used in crossing the line,
has been so often and so well described, that it need not be more than
alluded to.

[399] {617} "That will do for the marines, but the sailors won't believe

saw a machine invented for the casting of stones and darts, exclaimed
that it was the "grave of valour." The same story has been told of some
knights on the first application of gunpowder; but the original anecdote
is in Plutarch. [The Greek is "Ἀπόλωλεν, ἀνδρὸς ἀρετά [A)po/lôlen,
a)ndro\s a)reta/]," Plutarch's _Scripta Moralia_, 1839, i. 230.]

[401] {622} [Fletcher Christian, born 1763, was the fourth son of
Charles Christian, an attorney, of Moreland Close, in the parish of
Brigham, Cumberland. His family, which was of Manx extraction, was
connected with the Christians of Ewanrigg, and the Curwens of Workington
Hall. His brother Edward became Chief Justice of Ely, and was well known
as the editor of _Blackstones Commentaries_. For purposes of
verification (see _An Answer to certain Assertions, etc._, 1794, p. 9),
Bligh described him as "aged 24 years, five feet nine inches high,
blackish or very dark brown complexioned, dark brown hair, strong made,
star tatowed on the left breast," etc. According to "Morrison's
Journal," high words had passed between Bligh and Christian on more than
one occasion, and, on the day before the mutiny, a question having
arisen with regard to the disappearance of some cocoa-nuts, Christian
was cross-examined by the captain as to his share of the plunder. "I
really do not know, sir," he replied; "but I hope you do not think me so
mean as to be guilty of stealing yours." "Yes," said Bligh,
"you ---- hound, I do think so, or you could have given a better account
of them." It was after this offensive accusation that Christian
determined, in the first instance, to quit the ship, and on the morning
of April 28, 1788, finding the mate of the watch asleep, on the spur of
the moment resolved to lay violent hands on the captain, and assume the
command of the _Bounty_. The language attributed to Bligh reads like a
translation into the vernacular, but if Christian kept his designs to
himself, it is strange that they were immediately understood and acted
upon by a body of impromptu conspirators. Testimony, whether written or
spoken, with regard to the succession of events "in moments like to
these," is worth very little; but it is pretty evident that Christian
was a gentleman, and that Bligh's violent and unmannerly ratings were
the immediate cause of the mutiny.

Contradictory accounts are given of Christian's death. It is generally
believed that in the fourth year of the settlement on Pitcairn Island
the Tahitians formed a plot to massacre the Englishmen, and that
Christian was shot when at work in his plantation (_The Mutineers,
etc._, by Lady Belcher, 1870, p. 163; _The Mutiny, etc._, by Rosalind A.
Young, 1894, p. 28). On the other hand, Amasa Delano, in his _Narrative
of Voyages, etc._ (Boston, 1817, cap. v. p. 140), asserts that Captain
Mayhew Folger, who was the first to visit the island in 1808, "was very
explicit in his inquiry at the time, as well as in his account of it to
me, that they lived under Christian's government several years after
they landed; that during the whole time they enjoyed tolerable harmony;
that Christian became sick, and died a natural death." It stands to
reason that the ex-pirate, Alexander Smith, who had developed into John
Adams, the pious founder of a patriarchal colony, would be anxious to
draw a veil over the early years of the settlement, and would satisfy
the curiosity of visitors who were officers of the Royal Navy, as best
he could, and as the spirit moved him.]

[403] {629} Of this cave (which is no fiction) the original will be
found in the ninth chapter of "Mariner's Account of the Tonga Islands"
[1817, i. 267-279]. I have taken the poetical liberty to transplant it
to Toobonai, the last island where any distinct account is left of
Christian and his comrades.

[The following is the account given by Mariner: "On this island [Hoonga]
there is a peculiar cavern, which was first discovered by a young chief,
whilst diving after a turtle. The nature of this cavern will be better
understood if we imagine a hollow rock rising sixty feet or more above
the surface of the water, into the cavity of which there is no known
entrance but one, and that is on the side of the rock, as low down as
six feet under the water, into which it flows; and, consequently, the
base of the cavern may be said to be the sea itself." Mariner seeing
some young chiefs diving into the water one after another, and not rise
again, he inquired of the last, ... what they were about? "'Follow me,'"
said he, "'and I will take you where you have never been before....'"
Mariner prepared to follow his companion, and, guided by the light
reflected from his heels, entered the opening in the rock, and rose into
the cavern. The light was sufficient, after remaining about five
minutes, to show objects with some little distinctness; ...
Nevertheless, as it was desirable to have a stronger light, Mariner
dived out again, and, priming his pistol, tied plenty of gnatoo tight
round it, and wrapped the whole up in a plantain-leaf: he directed an
attendant to bring a torch in the same way. Thus prepared, he re-entered
the cavern, unwrapped the gnatoo, fired it by the flash of the powder,
and lighted the torch. "The place was now illuminated tolerably well....
It appeared (by guess) to be about forty feet wide in the main part, but
it branched off, on one side, in two narrower portions. The medium
height seemed also about forty feet. The roof was hung with stalactites
in a very curious way, resembling, upon a cursory view, the Gothic
arches and ornaments of an old church." According to one of the
matabooles present, the entire family of a certain chief had, in former
times, been condemned to death for conspiring against a rival
tyrant--the chief to be taken out to sea and drowned, the rest of the
family to be massacred. One of the chiefs daughters was a beautiful
girl, to whom the youth who discovered the cave was attached. "He had
long been enamoured of this young maiden, but had never dared to make
her acquainted with the soft emotions of his heart, knowing that she was
betrothed to a chief of higher rank and greater power, but now, ... no
time was to be lost; he flew to her abode ... declared himself her
deliverer if she would trust to his honour.... Soon her consenting hand
was clasped in his: the shades of evening favoured their escape ... till
her lover had brought a small canoe to a lonely part of the beach. In
this they speedily embarked.... They soon arrived at the rock, he leaped
into the water, and she, instructed by him, followed close after; they
rose into the cavern, and rested from their fatigue, partaking of some
refreshments which he had brought there for himself...." Here she
remained, visited from time to time by her more fortunate Leander, until
he was enabled to carry her off to the Fiji islands, where they dwelt
till the death of the tyrant, when they returned to Vavaoo, "and lived
long in peace and happiness."]

[404] {631} This may seem too minute for the general outline (in
Mariner's Account) from which it is taken. But few men have travelled
without seeing something of the kind--on _land_, that is. Without
adverting to Ellora, in Mungo Park's last journal, he mentions having
met with a rock or mountain so exactly resembling a Gothic cathedral,
that only minute inspection could convince him that it was a work of
nature.

[Ellora, a village in the Nizám's dominions, is thirteen miles
north-west of Aurangábád. "It is famous for its rock-caves and temples.
The chief building, called the kailás, ... is a great monolithic temple,
isolated from surrounding rock, and carved outside as well as in.... It
is said to have been built about the eighth century by Rájá Edu of
Ellichpur."--Hunter's _Imperial Gazetteer of India_, 1885, iv. 348-351.
The passage in Mungo Park's _Journal of a Mission to the Interior of
Africa_, 1815, p. 75, runs thus: "June 24th [1805],--Left Sullo, and
travelled through a country beautiful beyond imagination, with all the
possible diversities of _rock_, sometimes towering up like ruined
castles, spires, pyramids, etc. We passed one place so like a ruined
Gothic abbey, that we halted a little, before we could satisfy ourselves
that the niches, windows, etc., were all natural rock."]

[405] [Byron's quadrisyllable was, probably, a poetic licence. There is,
however, an obsolete plural, _stalactitæ_, to be found in the works of
John Woodward, M.D., _Fossils of England_, 1729, i. 155.]

[406] {633} The reader will recollect the epigram of the Greek
anthology, or its translation into most of the modern languages--

    "Whoe'er thou art, thy master see--
    He was, or is, or is to be."

[Byron is quoting from memory an "Illustration" in the notes to
_Collections from the Greek Anthology_, by the Rev. Robert Bland, 1813,
p. 402--

    "Whoe'er thou art, thy Lord and master see.
    Thou wast my Slave, thou art, or thou shall be."

The couplet was written by George Granville, Lord Lansdowne (1667-1735),
as an _Inscription for a Figure representing the God of Love_. (See _The
Genuine Works, etc._, 1732, I. 129.)]

[407] {634} The tradition is attached to the story of Eloïsa, that when
her body was lowered into the grave of Abelard (who had been buried
twenty years), he opened his arms to receive her.

[The story is told by Bayle, who quotes from a manuscript chronicle of
Tours, preserved in the notes of Andreas Quercetanus, affixed to the
_Historia Calamitatum Abælardi_: "Eadem defuncta ad tumulam apertum
depertata, maritus ejus qui multis diebus ante eam defunctus fuerat,
elevatis brachiis eam recepit, et ita earn amplexatus brachia sua

[408] In Thibault's account of Frederick the Second of Prussia, there is
a singular relation of a young Frenchman, who with his mistress appeared
to be of some rank. He enlisted and deserted at Schweidnitz; and after a
desperate resistance was retaken, having killed an officer, who
attempted to seize him after he was wounded, by the discharge of his
musket loaded with a _button_ of his uniform. Some circumstances on his
court-martial raised a great interest amongst his judges, who wished to
discover his real situation in life, which he offered to disclose, but
to the king only, to whom he requested permission to write. This was
refused, and Frederic was filled with the greatest indignation, from
baffled curiosity or some other motive, when he understood that his
request had been denied. [_Mes Souvenirs de vingt ans de séjour à

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES

This etext is a Unicode (UTF8) file. In a few places there are phrases
or lines of Greek text, each followed by a Beta-code transliteration,
for example: νους [Greek: nous].

An important feature of this edition is its copious footnotes. Footnotes
indexed with arabic numbers (e.g. [17], [221]) are informational. Note
text in square brackets is the work of editor E.H. Coleridge, and is
unique to this edition. Other note text is from earlier editions and is
by a preceding editor or Byron himself.

Footnotes indexed with letters (e.g. [c], [bf]) document variant forms
of the text from manuscripts and other sources.

In the original, footnotes were printed at the foot of the page on which
they were referenced, and their indices started over on each page. In
this etext, footnotes have been collected at the ends of each preface or
Canto, and have been numbered consecutively throughout. However, in the
blocks of footnotes are numbers in braces: {321}. These represent the
page number on which following notes originally appeared, and can be
used to find notes by page. For example, the Preface directs you to "a
note (pp. 495..." and you can locate this note in its new location by
searching for {495}.





                    PREFACE TO THE SIXTH VOLUME.


The text of this edition of _Don Juan_ has been collated with original
MSS. in the possession of the Lady Dorchester and Mr. John Murray. The
fragment of a Seventeenth Canto, consisting of fourteen stanzas, is now
printed and published for the first time.

I have collated with the original authorities, and in many instances
retranscribed, the numerous quotations from Sir G. Dalzell's _Shipwrecks
and Disasters at Sea_ (1812, 8vo) [Canto II. stanzas xxiv.-civ. pp.
87-112], and from a work entitled _Essai sur l'Histoire Ancienne et
Moderne de la Nouvelle Russie_, par le Marquis Gabriel de Castelnau
(1827, 8vo) [Canto VII. stanzas ix.--liii. pp. 304-320, and Canto VIII.
stanzas vi.--cxxvii. pp. 331-368], which were first included in the
notes to the fifteenth and sixteenth volumes of the edition of 1833, and
have been reprinted in subsequent issues of Lord Byron's _Poetical

                              NOTE.

It was intended that the whole of Lord Byron's Poetical Works should be
included in six volumes, corresponding to the six volumes of the
Letters, and announcements to this effect have been made; but this has
been found to be impracticable. The great mass of new material
incorporated in the Introductions, notes, and variants, has already
expanded several of the published volumes to a disproportionate size,
and _Don Juan_ itself occupies 612 pages.

Volume Seven, which will complete the work, will contain Occasional
Poems, Epigrams, etc., a Bibliography more complete than has ever
hitherto been published, and an exhaustive Index.

                    INTRODUCTION TO _DON JUAN_


Byron was a rapid as well as a voluminous writer. His _Tales_ were
thrown off at lightning speed, and even his dramas were thought out and
worked through with unhesitating energy and rapid achievement.
Nevertheless, the composition of his two great poems was all but
coextensive with his poetical life. He began the first canto of _Childe
Harold_ in the autumn of 1809, and he did not complete the fourth canto
till the spring of 1818. He began the first canto of _Don Juan_ in the
autumn of 1818, and he was still at work on a seventeenth canto in the
spring of 1823. Both poems were issued in parts, and with long intervals
of unequal duration between the parts; but the same result was brought
about by different causes and produced a dissimilar effect. _Childe
Harold_ consists of three distinct poems descriptive of three successive
travels or journeys in foreign lands. The adventures of the hero are but
the pretext for the shifting of the diorama; whereas in _Don Juan_ the
story is continuous, and the scenery is exhibited as a background for
the dramatic evolution of the personality of the hero. _Childe Harold_
came out at intervals, because there were periods when the author was
stationary; but the interruptions in the composition and publication of
_Don Juan_ were due to the disapproval and discouragement of friends,
and the very natural hesitation and procrastination of the publisher.
Canto I. was written in September, 1818; Canto II. in December-January,
1818-1819. Both cantos were published on July 15, 1819. Cantos III., IV.
were written in the winter of 1819-1820; Canto V., after an interval of
nine months, in October-November, 1820, but the publication of Cantos
III., IV., V. was delayed till August 8, 1821. The next interval was
longer still, but it was the last. In June, 1822, Byron began to work at
a sixth, and by the end of March, 1823, he had completed a sixteenth
canto. But the publication of these later cantos, which had been
declined by Murray, and were finally entrusted to John Hunt, was spread
over a period of several months. Cantos VI., VII., VIII., with a
Preface, were published July 15; Cantos IX., X., XI, August 29; Cantos
XII., XIII., XIV., December 17, 1823; and, finally, Cantos XV., XVI.,
March 26, 1824. The composition of _Don Juan_, considered as a whole,
synchronized with the composition of all the dramas (except _Manfred_)
and the following poems: _The Prophecy of Dante_, (the translation of)
_The Morgante Maggiore, The Vision of Judgment, The Age of Bronze_, and
_The Island_.

There is little to be said with regard to the "Sources" of _Don Juan_.
Frere's _Whistlecraft_ had suggested _Beppo_, and, at the same time, had
prompted and provoked a sympathetic study of Frere's Italian models,
Berni and Pulci (see "Introduction to _Beppo_," _Poetical Works_, 1901,
iv. 155-158; and "Introduction to _The Morgante Maggiore_" ibid., pp.
279-281); and, again, the success of _Beppo_, and, still more, a sense
of inspiration and the conviction that he had found the path to
excellence, suggested another essay of the _ottava rima_, a humorous
poem "_à la Beppo_" on a larger and more important scale. If Byron
possessed more than a superficial knowledge of the legendary "Don Juan,"
he was irresponsive and unimpressed. He speaks (letter to Murray,
February 16, 1821) of "the Spanish tradition;" but there is nothing to
show that he had read or heard of Tirso de Molina's (Gabriel Tellez) _El
Burlador de Sevilla y Convidado de Piedra_ (_The Deceiver of Seville and
the Stone Guest_), 1626, which dramatized the "ower true tale" of the
actual Don Juan Tenorio; or that he was acquainted with any of the
Italian (e.g. _Convitato di Pietra_, del Dottor Giacinto Andrea
Cicognini, Fiorentino [see L. Allacci _Dramaturgia_, 1755, 4º, p. 862])
or French adaptations of the legend (_e.g_. _Le Festin de Pierre, ou le
fils criminel_, Tragi-comédie de De Villiers, 1659; and Molière's _Dom
Juan, ou Le Festin de Pierre_, 1665). He had seen (_vide post_, p. 11,
note 2) Delpini's pantomime, which was based on Shadwell's
_Libertine_, and he may have witnessed, at Milan or Venice, a
performance of Mozart's _Don Giovanni_; but in taking Don Juan for his
"hero," he took the name only, and disregarded the "terrible figure" "of
the Titan of embodied evil, the likeness of sin made flesh" (see
_Selections from the Works of Lord Byron_, by A.C. Swinburne, 1885, p.
xxvi.), "as something to his purpose nothing"!

Why, then, did he choose the name, and what was the scheme or motif of
his poem? Something is to be gathered from his own remarks and
reflections; but it must be borne in mind that he is on the defensive,
and that his half-humorous paradoxes were provoked by advice and
opposition. Writing to Moore (September 19, 1818), he says, "I have
finished the first canto ... of a poem in the style and manner of
_Beppo_, encouraged by the good success of the same. It is ... meant to
be a little quietly facetious upon every thing. But I doubt whether it
is not--at least as far as it has gone--too free for these very modest
days." The critics before and after publication thought that _Don Juan_
_was_ "too free," and, a month after the two first cantos had been
issued, he writes to Murray (August 12, 1819), "You ask me for the plan
of Donny Johnny; I _have_ no plan--I _had_ no plan; but I had or have
materials.... You are too earnest and eager about a work never intended
to be serious. Do you suppose that I could have any intention but to
giggle and make giggle?--a playful satire, with as little poetry as
could be helped, was what I meant." Again, after the completion but
before the publication of Cantos III., IV., V., in a letter to Murray
(February 16, 1821), he writes, "The Fifth is so far from being the last
of _Don Juan_, that it is hardly the beginning. I meant to take him the
tour of Europe, with a proper mixture of siege, battle, and adventure,
and to make him finish as Anacharsis Cloots in the French Revolution....
I meant to have made him a _Cavalier Servente_ in Italy, and a cause for
a divorce in England, and a Sentimental 'Werther-faced' man in Germany,
so as to show the different ridicules of the society in each of these
countries, and to have displayed him gradually _gâté_ and _blasé_, as he
grew older, as is natural. But I had not quite fixed whether to make him
end in Hell, or in an unhappy marriage, not knowing which would be the
severest."

Byron meant what he said, but he kept back the larger truth. Great
works, in which the poet speaks _ex animo_, and the man lays bare the
very pulse of the machine, are not conceived or composed unconsciously
and at haphazard. Byron did not "whistle" _Don Juan_ "for want of
thought." He had found a thing to say, and he meant to make the world
listen. He had read with angry disapproval, but he had read, Coleridge's
_Critique on_ [Maturin's] _Bertram_ (_vide post_, p. 4, note 1), and,
it may be, had caught an inspiration from one brilliant sentence which
depicts the Don Juan of the legend somewhat after the likeness of Childe
Harold, if not of Lord Byron: "Rank, fortune, wit, talent, acquired
knowledge, and liberal accomplishments, with beauty of person, vigorous
health, ... all these advantages, elevated by the habits and sympathies
of noble birth and natural character, are ... combined in Don Juan, so
as to give him the means of carrying into all its practical consequences
the doctrine of a godless nature ... Obedience to nature is the only
virtue." Again, "It is not the wickedness of Don Juan ... which
constitutes the character an abstraction, ... but the rapid succession
of the correspondent acts and incidents, his intellectual superiority,
and the splendid accumulation of his gifts and desirable qualities as
coexistent with entire wickedness in one and the same person." Here was
at once a suggestion and a challenge.

Would it not be possible to conceive and to depict an ideal character,
gifted, gracious, and delightful, who should "carry into all its
practical consequences" the doctrine of a mundane, if not godless
doctrine, and, at the same time, retain the charities and virtues of
uncelestial but not devilish manhood? In defiance of monition and in
spite of resolution, the primrose path is trodden by all sorts and
conditions of men, sinners no doubt, but not necessarily abstractions of
sin, and to assert the contrary makes for cant and not for
righteousness. The form and substance of the poem were due to the
compulsion of Genius and the determination of Art, but the argument is a
vindication of the natural man. It is Byron's "criticism of life." _Don
Juan_ was _taboo_ from the first. The earlier issues of the first five
cantos were doubly anonymous. Neither author nor publisher subscribed
their names on the title-page. The book was a monster, and, as its maker
had foreseen, "all the world" shuddered. Immoral, in the sense that it
advocates immoral tenets, or prefers evil to good, it is not, but it is
unquestionably a dangerous book, which (to quote Kingsley's words used
in another connection) "the young and innocent will do well to leave
altogether unread." It is dangerous because it ignores resistance and
presumes submission to passion; it is dangerous because, as Byron
admitted, it is "now and then voluptuous;" and it is dangerous, in a
lesser degree, because, here and there, the purport of the quips and
allusions is gross and offensive. No one can take up the book without
being struck and arrested by these violations of modesty and decorum;
but no one can master its contents and become possessed of it as a whole
without perceiving that the mirror is held up to nature, that it
reflects spots and blemishes which, on a survey of the vast and various
orb, dwindle into _natural_ and so comparative insignificance. Byron was
under no delusion as to the grossness of _Don Juan_. His plea or
pretence, that he was sheltered by the superior grossness of Ariosto and
La Fontaine, of Prior and of Fielding, is _nihil ad rem_, if it is not
insincere. When Murray (May 3, 1819) charges him with "approximations to
indelicacy," he laughs himself away at the euphemism, but when Hobhouse
and "the Zoili of Albemarle Street" talked to him "about morality," he
flames out, "I maintain that it is the most moral of poems." He looked
upon his great work as a whole, and he knew that the "_raison d'être_ of
his song" was not only to celebrate, but, by the white light of truth,
to represent and exhibit the great things of the world--Love and War,
and Death by sea and land, and Man, half-angel, half-demon--the comedy
of his fortunes, and the tragedy of his passions and his fate.

_Don Juan_ has won great praise from the great. Sir Walter Scott
(_Edinburgh Weekly Journal_, May 19, 1824) maintained that its creator
"has embraced every topic of human life, and sounded every string of the
divine harp, from its slightest to its most powerful and
heart-astounding tones." Goethe (_Kunst und Alterthum_, 1821 [ed.
Weimar, iii. 197, and _Sämmtliche Werke_, xiii. 637]) described _Don
Juan_ as "a work of boundless genius." Shelley (letter to Byron, October
21, 1821), on the receipt of Cantos III., IV., V., bore testimony to his
"wonder and delight:" "This poem carries with it at once the stamp of
originality and defiance of imitation. Nothing has ever been written
like it in English, nor, if I may venture to prophesy, will there be,
unless carrying upon it the mark of a secondary and borrowed light....
You are building up a drama," he adds, "such as England has not yet
seen, and the task is sufficiently noble and worthy of you." Again, of
the fifth canto he writes (Shelley's _Prose Works_, ed. H. Buxton
Forman, iv. 219), "Every word has the stamp of immortality.... It
fulfils, in a certain degree, what I have long preached of
producing--something wholly new and relative to the age, and yet
surpassingly beautiful." Finally, a living poet, neither a disciple nor
encomiast of Byron, pays eloquent tribute to the strength and splendour
of _Don Juan_: "Across the stanzas ... we swim forward as over the
'broad backs of the sea;' they break and glitter, hiss and laugh, murmur
and move like waves that sound or that subside. There is in them a
delicious resistance, an elastic motion, which salt water has and fresh
water has not. There is about them a wide wholesome air, full of vivid
light and constant wind, which is only felt at sea. Life undulates and
Death palpitates in the splendid verse.... This gift of life and variety
is the supreme quality of Byron's chief poem" (_A Selection, etc._, by
A.C. Swinburne, 1885, p. x.).

                       DON JUAN.




                        FRAGMENT
           ON THE BACK OF THE MS. OF CANTO I.


    I WOULD to Heaven that I were so much clay,
      As I am blood, bone, marrow, passion, feeling--
    Because at least the past were passed away,
      And for the future--(but I write this reeling,
    Having got drunk exceedingly to-day,
      So that I seem to stand upon the ceiling)
    I say--the future is a serious matter--
    And so--for God's sake--hock and soda-water!




                     DEDICATION.[1]

                      I.

    BOB SOUTHEY! You're a poet--Poet-laureate,
      And representative of all the race;
    Although 't is true that you turned out a Tory at
      Last,--yours has lately been a common case;
    And now, my Epic Renegade! what are ye at?
      With all the Lakers, in and out of place?
    A nest of tuneful persons, to my eye
    Like "four and twenty Blackbirds in a pye;

                      II.

    "Which pye being opened they began to sing,"
      (This old song and new simile holds good),
    "A dainty dish to set before the King,"
      Or Regent, who admires such kind of food;--
    And Coleridge, too, has lately taken wing,
      But like a hawk encumbered with his hood,--
    Explaining Metaphysics to the nation--
    I wish he would explain his Explanation.[2]

                      III.

    You, Bob! are rather insolent, you know,
      At being disappointed in your wish
    To supersede all warblers here below,
      And be the only Blackbird in the dish;
    And then you overstrain yourself, or so,
      And tumble downward like the flying fish
    Gasping on deck, because you soar too high, Bob,
    And fall, for lack of moisture, quite a-dry, Bob![3]

                      IV.

    And Wordsworth, in a rather long "Excursion,"
      (I think the quarto holds five hundred pages),
    Has given a sample from the vasty version
      Of his new system[4] to perplex the sages;
    'T is poetry-at least by his assertion,
      And may appear so when the dog-star rages--
    And he who understands it would be able
    To add a story to the Tower of Babel.

                      V.

    You--Gentlemen! by dint of long seclusion
      From better company, have kept your own
    At Keswick, and, through still continued fusion
      Of one another's minds, at last have grown
    To deem as a most logical conclusion,
      That Poesy has wreaths for you alone:
    There is a narrowness in such a notion,
    Which makes me wish you'd change your lakes for Ocean.

                      VI.

    I would not imitate the petty thought,
      Nor coin my self-love to so base a vice,
    For all the glory your conversion brought,
      Since gold alone should not have been its price.
    You have your salary; was 't for that you wrought?
      And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.[5]
    You're shabby fellows--true--but poets still,
    And duly seated on the Immortal Hill.

                      VII.

    Your bays may hide the baldness of your brows--
      Perhaps some virtuous blushes;--let them go--
    To you I envy neither fruit nor boughs--
      And for the fame you would engross below,
    The field is universal, and allows
      Scope to all such as feel the inherent glow:
    Scott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe, will try
    'Gainst you the question with posterity.

                      VIII.

    For me, who, wandering with pedestrian Muses,
      Contend not with you on the wingéd steed,
    I wish your fate may yield ye, when she chooses,
      The fame you envy, and the skill you need;
    And, recollect, a poet nothing loses
      In giving to his brethren their full meed
    Of merit--and complaint of present days
    Is not the certain path to future praise.

                      IX.

    He that reserves his laurels for posterity
      (Who does not often claim the bright reversion)
    Has generally no great crop to spare it, he
      Being only injured by his own assertion;
    And although here and there some glorious rarity
      Arise like Titan from the sea's immersion,
    The major part of such appellants go
    To--God knows where--for no one else can know.

                      X.

    If, fallen in evil days on evil tongues,[6]
      Milton appealed to the Avenger, Time,
    If Time, the Avenger, execrates his wrongs,
      And makes the word "Miltonic" mean "_Sublime_,"
    _He_ deigned not to belie his soul in songs,
      Nor turn his very talent to a crime;
    _He_ did not loathe the Sire to laud the Son,
    But closed the tyrant-hater he begun.

                      XI.

    Think'st thou, could he--the blind Old Man--arise
      Like Samuel from the grave, to freeze once more
    The blood of monarchs with his prophecies,
      Or be alive again--again all hoar
    With time and trials, and those helpless eyes,
      And heartless daughters--worn--and pale[7]--and poor;
    Would _he_ adore a sultan? _he_ obey
    The intellectual eunuch Castlereagh?[8]

                      XII.

    Cold-blooded, smooth-faced, placid miscreant!
      Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin's gore,
    And thus for wider carnage taught to pant,
      Transferred to gorge upon a sister shore,
    The vulgarest tool that Tyranny could want,
      With just enough of talent, and no more,
    To lengthen fetters by another fixed,
    And offer poison long already mixed.

                      XIII.

    An orator of such set trash of phrase
      Ineffably--legitimately vile,
    That even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,
      Nor foes--all nations--condescend to smile,--
    Nor even a sprightly blunder's spark can blaze
      From that Ixion grindstone's ceaseless toil,
    That turns and turns to give the world a notion
    Of endless torments and perpetual motion.

                      XIV.

    A bungler even in its disgusting trade,
      And botching, patching, leaving still behind
    Something of which its masters are afraid--
      States to be curbed, and thoughts to be confined,
    Conspiracy or Congress to be made--
      Cobbling at manacles for all mankind--
    A tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,
    With God and Man's abhorrence for its gains.

                      XV.

    If we may judge of matter by the mind,
      Emasculated to the marrow _It_
    Hath but two objects, how to serve, and bind,
      Deeming the chain it wears even men may fit,
    Eutropius of its many masters,[9]--blind
      To worth as freedom, wisdom as to wit,
    Fearless--because _no_ feeling dwells in ice,
    Its very courage stagnates to a vice.[10]

                      XVI.

    Where shall I turn me not to _view_ its bonds,
      For I will never _feel_ them?--Italy!
    Thy late reviving Roman soul desponds
      Beneath the lie this State-thing breathed o'er thee[11]--
    Thy clanking chain, and Erin's yet green wounds,
      Have voices--tongues to cry aloud for me.
    Europe has slaves--allies--kings--armies still--
    And Southey lives to sing them very ill.

                      XVII.

    Meantime, Sir Laureate, I proceed to dedicate,
      In honest simple verse, this song to you.
    And, if in flattering strains I do not predicate,
      'T is that I still retain my "buff and blue;"[12]
    My politics as yet are all to educate:
      Apostasy's so fashionable, too,
    To keep _one_ creed's a task grown quite Herculean;
    Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?[13]

Venice, Sept. 16, 1818.


FOOTNOTES:

{3}[1] ["As the Poem is to be published anonymously, _omit_ the
Dedication. I won't attack the dog in the dark. Such things are for
scoundrels and renegadoes like himself" [_Revise_]. See, too, letter to
Murray, May 6, 1819 (_Letters_, 1900, iv. 294); and Southey's letter to
Bedford, July 31, 1819 (_Selections from the Letters, etc._, 1856, in.
137, 138). According to the editor of the _Works of Lord Byron_, 1833
(xv. 101), the existence of the Dedication "became notorious" in
consequence of Hobhouse's article in the _Westminster Review_, 1824. He
adds, for Southey's consolation and encouragement, that "for several
years the verses have been selling in the streets as a broadside," and
that "it would serve no purpose to exclude them on the present
occasion." But Southey was not appeased. He tells Allan Cunningham (June
3, 1833) that "the new edition of Byron's works is ... one of the very
worst symptoms of these bad times" (_Life and Correspondence_, 1850, vi.
217).]

{4}[2] [In the "Critique on _Bertram_," which Coleridge contributed to
the _Courier_, in 1816, and republished in the _Biographia Literaria_,
in 1817 (chap, xxiii.), he gives a detailed analysis of "the old Spanish
play, entitled _Atheista Fulminato [vide ante_, the 'Introduction to
_Don Juan_'] ... which under various names (_Don Juan_, the _Libertine_,
etc.) has had its day of favour in every country throughout Europe ...
Rank, fortune, wit, talent, acquired knowledge, and liberal
accomplishments, with beauty of person, vigorous health, and
constitutional hardihood,--all these advantages, elevated by the habits
and sympathies of noble birth and national character, are supposed to
have combined in Don Juan, so as to give him the means of carrying into
all its practical consequences the doctrine of a godless nature, as the
sole ground and efficient cause not only of all things, events, and
appearances, but likewise of all our thoughts, sensations, impulses, and
actions. Obedience to nature is the only virtue." It is possible that
Byron traced his own lineaments in this too life-like portraiture, and
at the same time conceived the possibility of a new Don Juan, "made up"
after his own likeness. His extreme resentment at Coleridge's just,
though unwise and uncalled-for, attack on Maturin stands in need of some
explanation. See letter to Murray, September 17, 1817 (_Letters_, 1900,
iv. 172).]

[3] ["Have you heard that _Don Juan_ came over with a dedication to me,
in which Lord Castlereagh and I (being hand in glove intimates) were
coupled together for abuse as 'the two Roberts'? A fear of persecution
(_sic_) from the _one_ Robert is supposed to be the reason why it has
been suppressed" (Southey to Rev. H. Hill, August 13, 1819, _Selections
from the Letters, etc._, 1856, iii. 142). For "Quarrel between Byron and
Southey," see Introduction to _The Vision of Judgment_, _Poetical
Works_, 1901, iv. 475-480; and _Letters_, 1901, vi. 377-399 (Appendix
I.).]

[4] [The reference must be to the detailed enumeration of "the powers
requisite for the production of poetry," and the subsequent antithesis
of Imagination and Fancy contained in the Preface to the collected
_Poems of William Wordsworth_, published in 1815. In the Preface to the
_Excursion_ (1814) it is expressly stated that "it is not the author's
intention formally to announce a system."]

{5}[5] Wordsworth's place may be in the Customs--it is, I think, in that
or the Excise--besides another at Lord Lonsdale's table, where this
poetical charlatan and political parasite licks up the crumbs with a
hardened alacrity; the converted Jacobin having long subsided into the
clownish sycophant [_despised retainer_,--_MS. erased_] of the worst
prejudices of the aristocracy.

[Wordsworth obtained his appointment as Distributor of Stamps for the
county of Westmoreland in March, 1813, through Lord Lonsdale's
"patronage" (see his letter, March 6, 1813). _The Excursion_ was
dedicated to Lord Lonsdale in a sonnet dated July 29, 1814--

    "Oft through thy fair domains, illustrious Peer,
    In youth I roamed ...
    Now, by thy care befriended, I appear
    Before thee, Lonsdale, and this Work present."

    "Would _he_ subside into a hackney Laureate--
    A scribbling, self-sold, soul-hired, scorned Iscariot?"

I doubt if "Laureate" and "Iscariot" be good rhymes, but must say, as
Ben Jonson did to Sylvester, who challenged him to rhyme with--

    "I, John Sylvester,
    Lay with your sister."

Jonson answered--"I, Ben Jonson, lay with your wife." Sylvester
answered,--"That is not rhyme."--"No," said Ben Jonson; "but it is
_true_."

[10] ["Mr. John Murray,--As publisher to the Admiralty and of various
Government works, if the five stanzas concerning Castlereagh should risk
your ears or the Navy List, you may omit them in the publication--in
that case the two last lines of stanza 10 [_i.e_. 11] must end with the
couplet (lines 7, 8) inscribed in the margin. The stanzas on Castlerighi
(as the Italians call him) are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15."--_MS. M_.]

[11] [Commenting on a "pathetic sentiment" of Leoni, the author of the
Italian translation of _Childe Harold_ ("Sciagurata condizione di questa
mia patria!"), Byron affirms that the Italians execrated Castlereagh "as
the cause, by the conduct of the English at Genoa." "Surely," he
exclaims, "that man will not die in his bed: there is no spot of the
earth where his name is not a hissing and a curse. Imagine what must be
the man's talent for Odium, who has contrived to spread his infamy like
a pestilence from Ireland to Italy, and to make his name an execration
in all languages."--Letter to Murray, May 8, 1820, _Letters_, 1901, v.
22, note 1.]

                   DON JUAN

              CANTO THE FIRST.[14]

                      I.

    I WANT a hero: an uncommon want,
      When every year and month sends forth a new one,
    Till, after cloying the gazettes with cant,
      The age discovers he is not the true one;
    Of such as these I should not care to vaunt,
      I'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan--
    We all have seen him, in the pantomime,[15]
    Sent to the Devil somewhat ere his time.

                      II.

    Vernon,[16] the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,
      Prince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,
    Evil and good, have had their tithe of talk,
      And filled their sign-posts then, like Wellesley now;
    Each in their turn like Banquo's monarchs stalk,
      Followers of Fame, "nine farrow"[17] of that sow:
    France, too, had Buonaparté[18] and Dumourier[19]
    Recorded in the Moniteur and Courier.

                      III.

    Barnave, Brissot, Condorcet, Mirabeau,
      Petion, Clootz, Danton, Marat, La Fayette[20]
    Were French, and famous people, as we know;
      And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,
    Joubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,[21]
      With many of the military set,
    Exceedingly remarkable at times,
    But not at all adapted to my rhymes.

                      IV.

    Nelson was once Britannia's god of War,
      And still should be so, but the tide is turned;
    There's no more to be said of Trafalgar,
      'T is with our hero quietly inurned;
    Because the army's grown more popular,
      At which the naval people are concerned;
    Besides, the Prince is all for the land-service.
    Forgetting Duncan, Nelson, Howe, and Jervis.

                      V.

    Brave men were living before Agamemnon[22]
      And since, exceeding valorous and sage,
    A good deal like him too, though quite the same none;
      But then they shone not on the poet's page,
    And so have been forgotten:--I condemn none,
      But can't find any in the present age
    Fit for my poem (that is, for my new one);
    So, as I said, I'll take my friend Don Juan.

                      VI.

    Most epic poets plunge _"in medias res"_[23]
      (Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),
    And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,
      What went before--by way of episode,
    While seated after dinner at his ease,
      Beside his mistress in some soft abode,
    Palace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,
    Which serves the happy couple for a tavern.

                      VII.

    That is the usual method, but not mine--
      My way is to begin with the beginning;
    The regularity of my design
      Forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,
    And therefore I shall open with a line
      (Although it cost me half an hour in spinning),
    Narrating somewhat of Don Juan's father,
    And also of his mother, if you'd rather.

                      VIII.

    In Seville was he born, a pleasant city,
      Famous for oranges and women,--he
    Who has not seen it will be much to pity,
      So says the proverb[24]--and I quite agree;
    Of all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,
      Cadiz perhaps--but that you soon may see;--
    Don Juan's parents lived beside the river,
    A noble stream, and called the Guadalquivir.

                      IX.

    His father's name was José-_Don_, of course,--
      A true Hidalgo, free from every stain
    Of Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source
      Through the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;
    A better cavalier ne'er mounted horse,
      Or, being mounted, e'er got down again,
    Than José, who begot our hero, who
    Begot--but that's to come----Well, to renew:

                      X.[25]

    His mother was a learnéd lady, famed
      For every branch of every science known--
    In every Christian language ever named,
      With virtues equalled by her wit alone:
    She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,
      And even the good with inward envy groan,
    Finding themselves so very much exceeded,
    In their own way, by all the things that she did.

                      XI.

    Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart
      All Calderon and greater part of Lopé;
    So, that if any actor missed his part,
      She could have served him for the prompter's copy;
    For her Feinagle's were an useless art,[26]
      And he himself obliged to shut up shop--he
    Could never make a memory so fine as
    That which adorned the brain of Donna Inez.

                      XII.

    Her favourite science was the mathematical,
      Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,
    Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,
      Her serious sayings darkened to sublimity;[a]
    In short, in all things she was fairly what I call
      A prodigy--her morning dress was dimity,
    Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,
    And other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.

                      XIII.

    She knew the Latin--that is, "the Lord's prayer,"
      And Greek--the alphabet--I'm nearly sure;
    She read some French romances here and there,
      Although her mode of speaking was not pure;
    For native Spanish she had no great care,
      At least her conversation was obscure;
    Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,
    As if she deemed that mystery would ennoble 'em.

                      XIV.

    She liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,
      And said there was analogy between 'em;
    She proved it somehow out of sacred song,
      But I must leave the proofs to those who've seen 'em;
    But this I heard her say, and can't be wrong,
      And all may think which way their judgments lean 'em,
    "'T is strange--the Hebrew noun which means 'I am,'
    The English always use to govern d--n."

                      XV.

    Some women use their tongues--she _looked_ a lecture,
      Each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,
    An all-in-all sufficient self-director,
      Like the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,[27]
    The Law's expounder, and the State's corrector,
      Whose suicide was almost an anomaly--
    One sad example more, that "All is vanity,"--
    (The jury brought their verdict in "Insanity!")

                      XVI.

    In short, she was a walking calculation,
      Miss Edgeworth's novels stepping from their covers,[28]
    Or Mrs. Trimmer's books on education,[29]
      Or "Coelebs' Wife"[30] set out in quest of lovers,
    Morality's prim personification,
      In which not Envy's self a flaw discovers;
    To others' share let "female errors fall,"[31]
    For she had not even one--the worst of all.

                      XVII.

    Oh! she was perfect past all parallel--
      Of any modern female saint's comparison;
    So far above the cunning powers of Hell,
      Her Guardian Angel had given up his garrison;
    Even her minutest motions went as well
      As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:[32]
    In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,
    Save thine "incomparable oil," Macassar![33]

                      XVIII.

    Perfect she was, but as perfection is
      Insipid in this naughty world of ours,
    Where our first parents never learned to kiss
      Till they were exiled from their earlier bowers,
    Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss,[b]
      (I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),
    Don José, like a lineal son of Eve,
    Went plucking various fruit without her leave.

                      XIX.

    He was a mortal of the careless kind,
      With no great love for learning, or the learned,
    Who chose to go where'er he had a mind,
      And never dreamed his lady was concerned;
    The world, as usual, wickedly inclined
      To see a kingdom or a house o'erturned,
    Whispered he had a mistress, some said _two_.
    But for domestic quarrels _one_ will do.

                      XX.

    Now Donna Inez had, with all her merit,
      A great opinion of her own good qualities;
    Neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,
      And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;[c]
    But then she had a devil of a spirit,
      And sometimes mixed up fancies with realities,
    And let few opportunities escape
    Of getting her liege lord into a scrape.

                      XXI.

    This was an easy matter with a man
      Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;
    And even the wisest, do the best they can,
      Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,
    That you might "brain them with their lady's fan;"[34]
      And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,
    And fans turn into falchions in fair hands,
    And why and wherefore no one understands.

                      XXII.

    'T is pity learnéd virgins ever wed
      With persons of no sort of education,
    Or gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,
      Grow tired of scientific conversation:
    I don't choose to say much upon this head,
      I'm a plain man, and in a single station,
    But--Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,
    Inform us truly, have they not hen-pecked you all?

                      XXIII.

    Don José and his lady quarrelled--_why_,
      Not any of the many could divine,
    Though several thousand people chose to try,
     'T was surely no concern of theirs nor mine;
    I loathe that low vice--curiosity;
      But if there's anything in which I shine,
    'T is in arranging all my friends' affairs,
    Not having, of my own, domestic cares.

                      XXIV.

    And so I interfered, and with the best
      Intentions, but their treatment was not kind;
    I think the foolish people were possessed,
      For neither of them could I ever find,
    Although their porter afterwards confessed--
      But that's no matter, and the worst's behind,
    For little Juan o'er me threw, down stairs,
    A pail of housemaid's water unawares.

                      XXV.

    A little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,
      And mischief-making monkey from his birth;
    His parents ne'er agreed except in doting
      Upon the most unquiet imp on earth;
    Instead of quarrelling, had they been but both in
      Their senses, they'd have sent young master forth
    To school, or had him soundly whipped at home,
    To teach him manners for the time to come.

                      XXVI.

    Don José and the Donna Inez led
      For some time an unhappy sort of life,
    Wishing each other, not divorced, but dead;[d]
      They lived respectably as man and wife,
    Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,
      And gave no outward signs of inward strife,
    Until at length the smothered fire broke out,
    And put the business past all kind of doubt.

                      XXVII.

    For Inez called some druggists and physicians,
      And tried to prove her loving lord was _mad_,[35]
    But as he had some lucid intermissions,
      She next decided he was only _bad_;
    Yet when they asked her for her depositions,
      No sort of explanation could be had,
    Save that her duty both to man and God[36]
    Required this conduct--which seemed very odd.[37]

                      XXVIII.

    She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,
      And opened certain trunks of books and letters,[38]
    All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;
      And then she had all Seville for abettors,
    Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);
      The hearers of her case became repeaters,
    Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,
    Some for amusement, others for old grudges.

                      XXIX.

    And then this best and meekest woman bore
      With such serenity her husband's woes,
    Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,
      Who saw their spouses killed, and nobly chose
    Never to say a word about them more--
      Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,
    And saw _his_ agonies with such sublimity,
    That all the world exclaimed, "What magnanimity!"

                      XXX.

    No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,
      Is philosophic in our former friends;
    'T is also pleasant to be deemed magnanimous,
      The more so in obtaining our own ends;
    And what the lawyers call a _"malus animus"_
      Conduct like this by no means comprehends:
    Revenge in person's certainly no virtue,
    But then 't is not _my_ fault, if _others_ hurt you.

                      XXXI.

    And if our quarrels should rip up old stories,
      And help them with a lie or two additional,
    _I_'m not to blame, as you well know--no more is
      Any one else--they were become traditional;
    Besides, their resurrection aids our glories
      By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:
    And Science profits by this resurrection--
    Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.

                      XXXII.

    Their friends had tried at reconciliation,[e]
      Then their relations, who made matters worse.
    ('T were hard to tell upon a like occasion
      To whom it may be best to have recourse--
    I can't say much for friend or yet relation)
      The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,[f]
    But scarce a fee was paid on either side
    Before, unluckily, Don José died.

                      XXXIII.

    He died: and most unluckily, because,
      According to all hints I could collect
    From Counsel learnéd in those kinds of laws,
      (Although their talk's obscure and circumspect)
    His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;
      A thousand pities also with respect
    To public feeling, which on this occasion
    Was manifested in a great sensation.

                      XXXIV.

    But ah! he died; and buried with him lay
      The public feeling and the lawyers' fees:
    His house was sold, his servants sent away,
      A Jew took one of his two mistresses,
    A priest the other--at least so they say:
      I asked the doctors after his disease--
    He died of the slow fever called the tertian,
    And left his widow to her own aversion.

                      XXXV.

    Yet José was an honourable man,
      That I must say, who knew him very well;
    Therefore his frailties I'll no further scan,
      Indeed there were not many more to tell:
    And if his passions now and then outran
      Discretion, and were not so peaceable
    As Numa's (who was also named Pompilius),
    He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.[g]

                      XXXVI.

    Whate'er might be his worthlessness or worth,
      Poor fellow! he had many things to wound him.
    Let's own--since it can do no good on earth--[h]
      It was a trying moment that which found him
    Standing alone beside his desolate hearth,
      Where all his household gods lay shivered round him:[39]
    No choice was left his feelings or his pride,
    Save Death or Doctors' Commons--so he died.[i]

                      XXXVII.

    Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir
      To a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands,
    Which, with a long minority and care,
      Promised to turn out well in proper hands:
    Inez became sole guardian, which was fair,
      And answered but to Nature's just demands;
    An only son left with an only mother
    Is brought up much more wisely than another.

                      XXXVIII.

    Sagest of women, even of widows, she
      Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,
    And worthy of the noblest pedigree,
      (His Sire was of Castile, his Dam from Aragon)
    Then, for accomplishments of chivalry,
      In case our Lord the King should go to war again,
    He learned the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,
    And how to scale a fortress--or a nunnery.

                      XXXIX.

    But that which Donna Inez most desired,
      And saw into herself each day before all
    The learnéd tutors whom for him she hired,
      Was, that his breeding should be strictly moral:
    Much into all his studies she inquired,
      And so they were submitted first to her, all,
    Arts, sciences--no branch was made a mystery
    To Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.

                      XL.

    The languages, especially the dead,
      The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,
    The arts, at least all such as could be said
      To be the most remote from common use,
    In all these he was much and deeply read:
      But not a page of anything that's loose,
    Or hints continuation of the species,
    Was ever suffered, lest he should grow vicious.

                      XLI.

    His classic studies made a little puzzle,
      Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,
    Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,
      But never put on pantaloons or bodices;[40]
    His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,
      And for their Æneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,[j]
    Were forced to make an odd sort of apology,
    For Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.

                      XLII.

    Ovid's a rake, as half his verses show him,
      Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,
    Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,
      I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,
    Although Longinus[41] tells us there is no hymn
      Where the Sublime soars forth on wings more ample;
    But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one
    Beginning with _"Formosum Pastor Corydon."_[42]

                      XLIII.

    Lucretius' irreligion is too strong
      For early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;
    I can't help thinking Juvenal was wrong,
      Although no doubt his real intent was good,
    For speaking out so plainly in his song,
      So much indeed as to be downright rude;
    And then what proper person can be partial
    To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?

                      XLIV.

    Juan was taught from out the best edition,
      Expurgated by learned men, who place,
    Judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision,
      The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface
    Too much their modest bard by this omission,[k]
      And pitying sore his mutilated case,
    They only add them all in an appendix,[43]
    Which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;

                      XLV.

    For there we have them all "at one fell swoop,"
      Instead of being scattered through the pages;
    They stand forth marshalled in a handsome troop,
      To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,
    Till some less rigid editor shall stoop
      To call them back into their separate cages,
    Instead of standing staring all together,
    Like garden gods--and not so decent either.

                      XLVI.

    The Missal too (it was the family Missal)
      Was ornamented in a sort of way
    Which ancient mass-books often are, and this all
      Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,
    Who saw those figures on the margin kiss all,
      Could turn their optics to the text and pray,
    Is more than I know--But Don Juan's mother
    Kept this herself, and gave her son another.

                      XLVII.

    Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,
      And homilies, and lives of all the saints;
    To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,
      He did not take such studies for restraints;
    But how Faith is acquired, and then insured,
      So well not one of the aforesaid paints
    As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,
    Which make the reader envy his transgressions.[44]

                      XLVIII.

    This, too, was a sealed book to little Juan--
      I can't but say that his mamma was right,
    If such an education was the true one.
      She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;
    Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,
      You might be sure she was a perfect fright;
    She did this during even her husband's life--
    I recommend as much to every wife.

                      XLIX.

    Young Juan waxed in goodliness and grace;
      At six a charming child, and at eleven
    With all the promise of as fine a face
      As e'er to Man's maturer growth was given:
    He studied steadily, and grew apace,
      And seemed, at least, in the right road to Heaven,
    For half his days were passed at church, the other
    Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.

                      L.

    At six, I said, he was a charming child,
      At twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;
    Although in infancy a little wild,
      They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy
    His natural spirit not in vain they toiled,
      At least it seemed so; and his mother's joy
    Was to declare how sage, and still, and steady,
    Her young philosopher was grown already.

                      LI.

    I had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,
     But what I say is neither here nor there:
    I knew his father well, and have some skill
      In character--but it would not be fair
    From sire to son to augur good or ill:
      He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair--
    But scandal's my aversion--I protest
    Against all evil speaking, even in jest.

                      LII.

    For my part I say nothing--nothing--but
      _This_ I will say--my reasons are my own--
    That if I had an only son to put
      To school (as God be praised that I have none),
    'T is not with Donna Inez I would shut
      Him up to learn his catechism alone,
    No--no--I'd send him out betimes to college,
    For there it was I picked up my own knowledge.

                      LIII.

    For there one learns--'t is not for me to boast,
      Though I acquired--but I pass over _that_,
    As well as all the Greek I since have lost:
      I say that there's the place--but "_Verbum sat_,"
    I think I picked up too, as well as most,
      Knowledge of matters--but no matter _what_--
    I never married--but, I think, I know
    That sons should not be educated so.

                      LIV.

    Young Juan now was sixteen years of age,
      Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seemed
    Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;
      And everybody but his mother deemed
    Him almost man; but she flew in a rage[45]
      And bit her lips (for else she might have screamed)
    If any said so--for to be precocious
    Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.

                      LV.

    Amongst her numerous acquaintance, all
      Selected for discretion and devotion,
    There was the Donna Julia, whom to call
      Pretty were but to give a feeble notion
    Of many charms in her as natural
      As sweetness to the flower, or salt to Ocean,
    Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid,
    (But this last simile is trite and stupid.)

                      LVI.

    The darkness of her Oriental eye
      Accorded with her Moorish origin;
    (Her blood was not all Spanish; by the by,
      In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin;)
    When proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,
      Boabdil wept:[46] of Donna Julia's kin
    Some went to Africa, some stayed in Spain--
    Her great great grandmamma chose to remain.

                      LVII.

    She married (I forget the pedigree)
      With an Hidalgo, who transmitted down
    His blood less noble than such blood should be;
      At such alliances his sires would frown,
    In that point so precise in each degree
      That they bred _in and in_, as might be shown,
    Marrying their cousins--nay, their aunts, and nieces,
    Which always spoils the breed, if it increases.

                      LVIII.

    This heathenish cross restored the breed again,
      Ruined its blood, but much improved its flesh;
    For from a root the ugliest in Old Spain
      Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;
    The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:
      But there's a rumour which I fain would hush,[l]
    'T is said that Donna Julia's grandmamma
    Produced her Don more heirs at love than law.

                      LIX.

    However this might be, the race went on
      Improving still through every generation,
    Until it centred in an only son,
      Who left an only daughter; my narration
    May have suggested that this single one
      Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion
    I shall have much to speak about), and she
    Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.

                      LX.

    Her eye (I'm very fond of handsome eyes)
      Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire
    Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise
      Flashed an expression more of pride than ire,
    And love than either; and there would arise
      A something in them which was not desire,
    But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul
    Which struggled through and chastened down the whole.

                      LXI.

    Her glossy hair was clustered o'er a brow
      Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;
    Her eyebrow's shape was like the aërial bow,
      Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,
    Mounting, at times, to a transparent glow,
      As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,
    Possessed an air and grace by no means common:
    Her stature tall--I hate a dumpy woman.

                      LXII.

    Wedded she was some years, and to a man
      Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;
    And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE
      'T were better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,
    Especially in countries near the sun:
      And now I think on 't, "_mi vien in mente_",
    Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue
    Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.[m]

                      LXIII.

    'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,
      And all the fault of that indecent sun,
    Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,
      But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,
    That howsoever people fast and pray,
      The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:
    What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,
    Is much more common where the climate's sultry,

                      LXIV.

    Happy the nations of the moral North!
      Where all is virtue, and the winter season
    Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth
      ('T was snow that brought St. Anthony[47] to reason);
    Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,
      By laying whate'er sum, in mulct, they please on
    The lover, who must pay a handsome price,
    Because it is a marketable vice.

                      LXV.

    Alfonso was the name of Julia's lord,
      A man well looking for his years, and who
    Was neither much beloved nor yet abhorred:
      They lived together as most people do,
    Suffering each other's foibles by accord,
      And not exactly either _one_ or _two_;
    Yet he was jealous, though he did not show it,
    For Jealousy dislikes the world to know it.

                      LXVI.

    Julia was--yet I never could see why--
      With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;
    Between their tastes there was small sympathy,
      For not a line had Julia ever penned:
    Some people whisper (but, no doubt, they lie,
      For Malice still imputes some private end)
    That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso's marriage,
    Forgot with him her very prudent carriage;

                      LXVII.

    And that still keeping up the old connection,
      Which Time had lately rendered much more chaste,
    She took his lady also in affection,
      And certainly this course was much the best:
    She flattered Julia with her sage protection,
      And complimented Don Alfonso's taste;
    And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,
    At least she left it a more slender handle.

                      LXVIII.

    I can't tell whether Julia saw the affair
      With other people's eyes, or if her own
    Discoveries made, but none could be aware
      Of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown;
    Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,
      Indifferent from the first, or callous grown:
    I'm really puzzled what to think or say,
    She kept her counsel in so close a way.

                      LXIX.

    Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,
      Caressed him often--such a thing might be
    Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,
      When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;
    But I am not so sure I should have smiled
      When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;
    These few short years make wondrous alterations,
    Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.

                      LXX.

    Whate'er the cause might be, they had become
      Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,
    Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,
      And much embarrassment in either eye;
    There surely will be little doubt with some
      That Donna Julia knew the reason why,
    But as for Juan, he had no more notion
    Than he who never saw the sea of Ocean.

                      LXXI.

    Yet Julia's very coldness still was kind,
      And tremulously gentle her small hand
    Withdrew itself from his, but left behind
      A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland
    And slight, so very slight, that to the mind
      'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand
    Wrought change with all Armida's[48] fairy art
    Like what this light touch left on Juan's heart.

                      LXXII.

    And if she met him, though she smiled no more,
      She looked a sadness sweeter than her smile,
    As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store
      She must not own, but cherished more the while
    For that compression in its burning core;
      Even Innocence itself has many a wile,
    And will not dare to trust itself with truth,
    And Love is taught hypocrisy from youth.

                      LXXIII.

    But Passion most dissembles, yet betrays
      Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky
    Foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays
      Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,
    And in whatever aspect it arrays
      Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;
    Coldness or Anger, even Disdain or Hate,
    Are masks it often wears, and still too late.

                      LXXIV.

    Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,
      And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,
    And burning blushes, though for no transgression,
      Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;
    All these are little preludes to possession,
      Of which young Passion cannot be bereft,
    And merely tend to show how greatly Love is
    Embarrassed at first starting with a novice.

                      LXXV.

    Poor Julia's heart was in an awkward state;
      She felt it going, and resolved to make
    The noblest efforts for herself and mate,
      For Honour's, Pride's, Religion's, Virtue's sake:
    Her resolutions were most truly great,
      And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:
    She prayed the Virgin Mary for her grace,
    As being the best judge of a lady's case.[49]

                      LXXVI.

    She vowed she never would see Juan more,
      And next day paid a visit to his mother,
    And looked extremely at the opening door,
      Which, by the Virgin's grace, let in another;
    Grateful she was, and yet a little sore--
      Again it opens, it can be no other,
    'T is surely Juan now--No! I'm afraid
    That night the Virgin was no further prayed.[50]

                      LXXVII.

    She now determined that a virtuous woman
      Should rather face and overcome temptation,
    That flight was base and dastardly, and no man
      Should ever give her heart the least sensation,
    That is to say, a thought beyond the common
      Preference, that we must feel, upon occasion,
    For people who are pleasanter than others,
    But then they only seem so many brothers.

                      LXXVIII.

    And even if by chance--and who can tell?
      The Devil's so very sly--she should discover
    That all within was not so very well,
      And, if still free, that such or such a lover
    Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell
      Such thoughts, and be the better when they're over;
    And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:
    I recommend young ladies to make trial.

                      LXXIX.

    And, then, there are such things as Love divine,
      Bright and immaculate, unmixed and pure,
    Such as the angels think so very fine,
      And matrons, who would be no less secure,
    Platonic, perfect, "just such love as mine;"
      Thus Julia said--and thought so, to be sure;
    And so I'd have her think, were _I_ the man
    On whom her reveries celestial ran.

                      LXXX.

    Such love is innocent, and may exist
      Between young persons without any danger.
    A hand may first, and then a lip be kissed;
      For my part, to such doings I'm a stranger,
    But _hear_ these freedoms form the utmost list
      Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:
    If people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,
    But not my fault--I tell them all in time.

                      LXXXI.

    Love, then, but Love within its proper limits,
      Was Julia's innocent determination
    In young Don Juan's favour, and to him its
      Exertion might be useful on occasion;
    And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its
      Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion
    He might be taught, by Love and her together--
    I really don't know what, nor Julia either.

                      LXXXII.

    Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced
      In mail of proof--her purity of soul[51]--
    She, for the future, of her strength convinced,
      And that her honour was a rock, or mole,[n]
    Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed
      With any kind of troublesome control;
    But whether Julia to the task was equal
    Is that which must be mentioned in the sequel.

                      LXXXIII.

    Her plan she deemed both innocent and feasible,
      And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen
    Not Scandal's fangs could fix on much that's seizable,
      Or if they did so, satisfied to mean
    Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable--
      A quiet conscience makes one so serene!
    Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded
    That all the Apostles would have done as they did.

                      LXXXIV.

    And if in the mean time her husband died,
      But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross
    Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sighed)
      Never could she survive that common loss;
    But just suppose that moment should betide,
      I only say suppose it--_inter nos_:
    (This should be _entre nous_, for Julia thought
    In French, but then the rhyme would go for nought.)

                      LXXXV.

    I only say, suppose this supposition:
      Juan being then grown up to man's estate
    Would fully suit a widow of condition,
      Even seven years hence it would not be too late;
    And in the interim (to pursue this vision)
      The mischief, after all, could not be great,
    For he would learn the rudiments of Love,
    I mean the _seraph_ way of those above.

                      LXXXVI.

    So much for Julia! Now we'll turn to Juan.
      Poor little fellow! he had no idea
    Of his own case, and never hit the true one;
      In feelings quick as Ovid's Miss Medea,[52]
    He puzzled over what he found a new one,
      But not as yet imagined it could be a
    Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,
    Which, with a little patience, might grow charming.

                      LXXXVII.

    Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,
      His home deserted for the lonely wood,
    Tormented with a wound he could not know,
      His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:
    I'm fond myself of solitude or so,
      But then, I beg it may be understood,
    By solitude I mean a Sultan's (not
    A Hermit's), with a haram for a grot.

                      LXXXVIII.

    "Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,
      Where Transport and Security entwine,
    Here is the Empire of thy perfect bliss,
      And here thou art a God indeed divine."[53]
    The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,
      With the exception of the second line,
    For that same twining "Transport and Security"
    Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.

                      LXXXIX.

    The Poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals
      To the good sense and senses of mankind,
    The very thing which everybody feels,
      As all have found on trial, or may find,
    That no one likes to be disturbed at meals
      Or love.--I won't say more about "entwined"
    Or "Transport," as we knew all that before,
    But beg "Security" will bolt the door.

                      XC.

    Young Juan wandered by the glassy brooks,
      Thinking unutterable things; he threw
    Himself at length within the leafy nooks
      Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;
    There poets find materials for their books,
      And every now and then we read them through,
    So that their plan and prosody are eligible,
    Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.

                      XCI.

    He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued
      His self-communion with his own high soul,
    Until his mighty heart, in its great mood,
      Had mitigated part, though not the whole
    Of its disease; he did the best he could
      With things not very subject to control,
    And turned, without perceiving his condition,
    Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.[54]

                      XCII.

    He thought about himself, and the whole earth,
      Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,
    And how the deuce they ever could have birth:
      And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,
    How many miles the moon might have in girth,
      Of air-balloons, and of the many bars
    To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;--
    And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.

                      XCIII.

    In thoughts like these true Wisdom may discern
      Longings sublime, and aspirations high,
    Which some are born with, but the most part learn
      To plague themselves withal, they know not why:
    'T was strange that one so young should thus concern
      His brain about the action of the sky;[o]
    If _you_ think 't was Philosophy that this did,
    I can't help thinking puberty assisted.

                      XCIV.

    He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,
      And heard a voice in all the winds; and then
    He thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,
      And how the goddesses came down to men:
    He missed the pathway, he forgot the hours,
      And when he looked upon his watch again,
    He found how much old Time had been a winner--
    He also found that he had lost his dinner.

                      XCV.

    Sometimes he turned to gaze upon his book,
      Boscan,[55] or Garcilasso;[56]--by the wind
    Even as the page is rustled while we look,
      So by the poesy of his own mind
    Over the mystic leaf his soul was shook,
      As if 't were one whereon magicians bind
    Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,
    According to some good old woman's tale.

                      XCVI.

    Thus would he while his lonely hours away
      Dissatisfied, not knowing what he wanted;
    Nor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay,
      Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,
    A bosom whereon he his head might lay,
      And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,
    With----several other things, which I forget,
    Or which, at least, I need not mention yet.

                      XCVII.

    Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,
      Could not escape the gentle Julia's eyes;
    She saw that Juan was not at his ease;
      But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,
    Is, that the Donna Inez did not tease
      Her only son with question or surmise;
    Whether it was she did not see, or would not,
    Or, like all very clever people, could not.

                      XCVIII.

    This may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;
      For instance--gentlemen, whose ladies take
    Leave to o'erstep the written rights of Woman,
      And break the----Which commandment is 't they break?
    (I have forgot the number, and think no man
      Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake;)
    I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,
    They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.

                      XCIX.

    A real husband always is suspicious,
      But still no less suspects in the wrong place,[p]
    Jealous of some one who had no such wishes,
      Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace,
    By harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;
      The last indeed's infallibly the case:
    And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,
    He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.

                      C.

    Thus parents also are at times short-sighted:
      Though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover,
    The while the wicked world beholds delighted,
      Young Hopeful's mistress, or Miss Fanny's lover,
    Till some confounded escapade has blighted
      The plan of twenty years, and all is over;
    And then the mother cries, the father swears,
    And wonders why the devil he got heirs.

                      CI.

    But Inez was so anxious, and so clear
      Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,
    She had some other motive much more near
      For leaving Juan to this new temptation,
    But what that motive was, I sha'n't say here;
      Perhaps to finish Juan's education,
    Perhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,
    In case he thought his wife too great a prize.

                      CII.

    It was upon a day, a summer's day;--
      Summer's indeed a very dangerous season,
    And so is spring about the end of May;
      The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;
    But whatsoe'er the cause is, one may say,
      And stand convicted of more truth than treason,
    That there are months which nature grows more merry in,--
    March has its hares, and May must have its heroine.

                      CIII.

    'T was on a summer's day--the sixth of June:
      I like to be particular in dates,
    Not only of the age, and year, but moon;
      They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates
    Change horses, making History change its tune,[q]
      Then spur away o'er empires and o'er states,
    Leaving at last not much besides chronology,
    Excepting the post-obits of theology.[r]

                      CIV.

    'T was on the sixth of June, about the hour
      Of half-past six--perhaps still nearer seven--
    When Julia sate within as pretty a bower
      As e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven
    Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,[57]
      To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,
    With all the trophies of triumphant song--
    He won them well, and may he wear them long!

                      CV.

    She sate, but not alone; I know not well
      How this same interview had taken place,
    And even if I knew, I should not tell--
      People should hold their tongues in any case;
    No matter how or why the thing befell,
      But there were she and Juan, face to face--
    When two such faces are so, 't would be wise,
    But very difficult, to shut their eyes.

                      CVI.

    How beautiful she looked! her conscious heart
      Glowed in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong:
    Oh Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,
      Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong!
    How self-deceitful is the sagest part
      Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along!--
    The precipice she stood on was immense,
    So was her creed in her own innocence.[s]

                      CVII.

    She thought of her own strength, and Juan's youth,
      And of the folly of all prudish fears,
    Victorious Virtue, and domestic Truth,
      And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:
    I wish these last had not occurred, in sooth,
      Because that number rarely much endears,
    And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,
    Sounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money.

                      CVIII.

    When people say, "I've told you _fifty_ times,"
      They mean to scold, and very often do;
    When poets say, "I've written _fifty_ rhymes,"
      They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;
    In gangs of _fifty_, thieves commit their crimes;
      At _fifty_ love for love is rare, 't is true,
    But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,
    A good deal may be bought for _fifty_ Louis.

                      CIX.

    Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love
      For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,
    By all the vows below to Powers above,
      She never would disgrace the ring she wore,
    Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;
      And while she pondered this, besides much more,
    One hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,
    Quite by mistake--she thought it was her own;

                      CX.

    Unconsciously she leaned upon the other,
      Which played within the tangles of her hair;
    And to contend with thoughts she could not smother
      She seemed by the distraction of her air.
    'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother
      To leave together this imprudent pair,[t]
    She who for many years had watched her son so--
    I'm very certain _mine_ would not have done so.

                      CXI.

    The hand which still held Juan's, by degrees
      Gently, but palpably confirmed its grasp,
    As if it said, "Detain me, if you please;"
      Yet there's no doubt she only meant to clasp
    His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze;
      She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,
    Had she imagined such a thing could rouse
    A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.

                      CXII.

    I cannot know what Juan thought of this,
      But what he did, is much what you would do;
    His young lip thanked it with a grateful kiss,
      And then, abashed at its own joy, withdrew
    In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,--
      Love is so very timid when 't is new:
    She blushed, and frowned not, but she strove to speak,
    And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.

                      CXIII.

    The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:
      The Devil's in the moon for mischief; they
    Who called her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon
      Their nomenclature; there is not a day,
    The longest, not the twenty-first of June,
      Sees half the business in a wicked way,
    On which three single hours of moonshine smile--
    And then she looks so modest all the while!

                      CXIV.

    There is a dangerous silence in that hour,
      A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul
    To open all itself, without the power
      Of calling wholly back its self-control;
    The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,
      Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,
    Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws
    A loving languor, which is not repose.

                      CXV.

    And Julia sate with Juan, half embraced
      And half retiring from the glowing arm,
    Which trembled like the bosom where 't was placed;
      Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,
    Or else 't were easy to withdraw her waist;
      But then the situation had its charm,
    And then--God knows what next--I can't go on;
    I'm almost sorry that I e'er begun.

                      CXVI.

    Oh Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,
      With your confounded fantasies, to more
    Immoral conduct by the fancied sway
      Your system feigns o'er the controlless core
    Of human hearts, than all the long array
      Of poets and romancers:--You're a bore,
    A charlatan, a coxcomb--and have been,
    At best, no better than a go-between.

                      CXVII.

    And Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,
      Until too late for useful conversation;
    The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,
      I wish, indeed, they had not had occasion;
    But who, alas! can love, and then be wise?
      Not that Remorse did not oppose Temptation;
    A little still she strove, and much repented,
    And whispering "I will ne'er consent"--consented.

                      CXVIII.

    'T is said that Xerxes offered a reward[58]
      To those who could invent him a new pleasure:
    Methinks the requisition's rather hard,
      And must have cost his Majesty a treasure:
    For my part, I'm a moderate-minded bard,
      Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);
    I care not for new pleasures, as the old
    Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.

                      CXIX.

    Oh Pleasure! you're indeed a pleasant thing,[59]
      Although one must be damned for you, no doubt:
    I make a resolution every spring
      Of reformation, ere the year run out,
    But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,
      Yet still, I trust, it may be kept throughout:
    I'm very sorry, very much ashamed,
    And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaimed.

                      CXX.

    Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take--
      Start not! still chaster reader--she'll be nice hence-
    Forward, and there is no great cause to quake;
      This liberty is a poetic licence,
    Which some irregularity may make
      In the design, and as I have a high sense
    Of Aristotle and the Rules, 't is fit
    To beg his pardon when I err a bit.

                      CXXI.

    This licence is to hope the reader will
      Suppose from June the sixth (the fatal day,
    Without whose epoch my poetic skill
      For want of facts would all be thrown away),
    But keeping Julia and Don Juan still
      In sight, that several months have passed; we'll say
    'T was in November, but I'm not so sure
    About the day--the era's more obscure.

                      CXXII.

    We'll talk of that anon.--'T is sweet to hear
      At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep
    The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,[60]
      By distance mellowed, o'er the waters sweep;
    'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;
      'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep
    From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high
    The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.

                      CXXIII.

    'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark
      Bay deep-mouthed welcome as we draw near home;
    'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark
      Our coming, and look brighter when we come;[u]
    'T is sweet to be awakened by the lark,
      Or lulled by falling waters; sweet the hum
    Of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,
    The lisp of children, and their earliest words.

                      CXXIV.

    Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes
      In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,
    Purple and gushing: sweet are our escapes
      From civic revelry to rural mirth;
    Sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,
      Sweet to the father is his first-born's birth,
    Sweet is revenge--especially to women--
    Pillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.

                      CXXV.

    Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet[v]
      The unexpected death of some old lady,
    Or gentleman of seventy years complete,
      Who've made "us youth"[61] wait too--too long already,
    For an estate, or cash, or country seat,
      Still breaking, but with stamina so steady,
    That all the Israelites are fit to mob its
    Next owner for their double-damned post-obits.[w]

                      CXXVI.

    'T is sweet to win, no matter how, one's laurels,
      By blood or ink; 't is sweet to put an end
    To strife; 't is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels,
      Particularly with a tiresome friend:
    Sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;
      Dear is the helpless creature we defend
    Against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot[62]
    We ne'er forget, though there we are forgot.

                      CXXVII.

    But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,
      Is first and passionate Love--it stands alone,
    Like Adam's recollection of his fall;
      The Tree of Knowledge has been plucked--all 's known--
    And Life yields nothing further to recall
      Worthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown,
    No doubt in fable, as the unforgiven
    Fire which Prometheus filched for us from Heaven.

                      CXXVIII.

    Man's a strange animal, and makes strange use
      Of his own nature, and the various arts,
    And likes particularly to produce
      Some new experiment to show his parts;
    This is the age of oddities let loose,
      Where different talents find their different marts;
    You'd best begin with truth, and when you've lost your
    Labour, there's a sure market for imposture.

                      CXXIX.

    What opposite discoveries we have seen!
      (Signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.)
    One makes new noses[63], one a guillotine,
      One breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;
    But Vaccination certainly has been
      A kind antithesis to Congreve's rockets,[64]
    With which the Doctor paid off an old pox,
    By borrowing a new one from an ox.[65]

                      CXXX.

    Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes:
      And Galvanism has set some corpses grinning,[66]
    But has not answered like the apparatus
      Of the Humane Society's beginning,
    By which men are unsuffocated gratis:
      What wondrous new machines have late been spinning!
    I said the small-pox has gone out of late;
    Perhaps it may be followed by the great.[67]

                      CXXXI.

    'T is said the great came from America;
      Perhaps it may set out on its return,--
    The population there so spreads, they say
      'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,
    With war, or plague, or famine--any way,
      So that civilisation they may learn;
    And which in ravage the more loathsome evil is--
    Their real _lues,_ or our pseudo-syphilis?

                      CXXXII.

    This is the patent age of new inventions
      For killing bodies, and for saving souls,
    All propagated with the best intentions:
      Sir Humphry Davy's lantern,[68] by which coals
    Are safely mined for in the mode he mentions,
      Tombuctoo travels,[69] voyages to the Poles[70]
    Are ways to benefit mankind, as true,
    Perhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.

                      CXXXIII.

    Man's a phenomenon, one knows not what,
      And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;
    'T is pity though, in this sublime world, that
      Pleasure's a sin, and sometimes Sin's a pleasure;[x]
    Few mortals know what end they would be at,
      But whether Glory, Power, or Love, or Treasure,
    The path is through perplexing ways, and when
    The goal is gained, we die, you know--and then----

                      CXXXIV.

    What then?--I do not know, no more do you--
      And so good night.--Return we to our story:
    'T was in November, when fine days are few,
      And the far mountains wax a little hoary,
    And clap a white cape on their mantles blue;[y]
      And the sea dashes round the promontory,
    And the loud breaker boils against the rock,
    And sober suns must set at five o'clock.

                      CXXXV.

    'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;[z]
      No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud
    By gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright
      With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;
    There's something cheerful in that sort of light,
      Even as a summer sky's without a cloud:
    I'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,[aa][71]
    A lobster salad[72], and champagne, and chat.

                      CXXXVI.

    'T was midnight--Donna Julia was in bed,
      Sleeping, most probably,--when at her door
    Arose a clatter might awake the dead,
      If they had never been awoke before,
    And that they have been so we all have read,
      And are to be so, at the least, once more;--
    The door was fastened, but with voice and fist
    First knocks were heard, then "Madam--Madam--hist!

                      CXXXVII.

    "For God's sake, Madam--Madam--here's my master,[73]
      With more than half the city at his back--Was
    ever heard of such a curst disaster!
      'T is not my fault--I kept good watch--Alack!
    Do pray undo the bolt a little faster--
      They're on the stair just now, and in a crack
    Will all be here; perhaps he yet may fly--
    Surely the window's not so _very_ high!"

                      CXXXVIII.

    By this time Don Alfonso was arrived,
      With torches, friends, and servants in great number;
    The major part of them had long been wived,
      And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber
    Of any wicked woman, who contrived
      By stealth her husband's temples to encumber:
    Examples of this kind are so contagious,
    Were _one_ not punished, _all_ would be outrageous.

                      CXXXIX.

    I can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion
      Could enter into Don Alfonso's head;
    But for a cavalier of his condition
      It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,
    Without a word of previous admonition,
      To hold a levee round his lady's bed,
    And summon lackeys, armed with fire and sword,
    To prove himself the thing he most abhorred.

                      CXL.

    Poor Donna Julia! starting as from sleep,
      (Mind--that I do not say--she had not slept),
    Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;
      Her maid, Antonia, who was an adept,
    Contrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,
      As if she had just now from out them crept:[ab]
    I can't tell why she should take all this trouble
    To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.

                      CXLI.

    But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,
      Appeared like two poor harmless women, who
    Of goblins, but still more of men afraid,
      Had thought one man might be deterred by two,
    And therefore side by side were gently laid,
      Until the hours of absence should run through,
    And truant husband should return, and say,
    "My dear,--I was the first who came away."

                      CXLII.

    Now Julia found at length a voice, and cried,
      "In Heaven's name, Don Alfonso, what d' ye mean?
    Has madness seized you? would that I had died
      Ere such a monster's victim I had been![ac]
    What may this midnight violence betide,
      A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?
    Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?
    Search, then, the room!"--Alfonso said, "I will."

                      CXLIII.

    _He_ searched, _they_ searched, and rummaged everywhere,
      Closet and clothes' press, chest and window-seat,
    And found much linen, lace, and several pair
      Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,
    With other articles of ladies fair,
      To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:
    Arras they pricked and curtains with their swords,
    And wounded several shutters, and some boards.

                      CXLIV.

    Under the bed they searched, and there they found--
      No matter what--it was not that they sought;
    They opened windows, gazing if the ground
      Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;
    And then they stared each others' faces round:
      'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,
    And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,
    Of looking _in_ the bed as well as under.

                      CXLV.

    During this inquisition Julia's tongue[ad]
      Was not asleep--"Yes, search and search," she cried,
    "Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!
      It was for this that I became a bride!
    For this in silence I have suffered long
      A husband like Alfonso at my side;
    But now I'll bear no more, nor here remain,
    If there be law or lawyers in all Spain.

                      CXLVI.

    "Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,
      If ever you indeed deserved the name,
    Is 't worthy of your years?--you have threescore--
      Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same--
    Is 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore
      For facts against a virtuous woman's fame?
    Ungrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,
    How dare you think your lady would go on so?

                      CXLVII.

    "Is it for this I have disdained to hold
      The common privileges of my sex?
    That I have chosen a confessor so old
      And deaf, that any other it would vex,
    And never once he has had cause to scold,
      But found my very innocence perplex
    So much, he always doubted I was married--
    How sorry you will be when I've miscarried!

                      CXLVIII.

    "Was it for this that no Cortejo[74] e'er
      I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?
    Is it for this I scarce went anywhere,
      Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?
    Is it for this, whate'er my suitors were,
      I favoured none--nay, was almost uncivil?
    Is it for this that General Count O'Reilly,
    Who took Algiers,[75] declares I used him vilely?

                      CXLIX.

    "Did not the Italian _Musico_ Cazzani
      Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?
    Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,[76]
      Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?
    Were there not also Russians, English, many?
      The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,
    And Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,
    Who killed himself for love (with wine) last year.

                      CL.

    "Have I not had two bishops at my feet?
      The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez;
    And is it thus a faithful wife you treat?
      I wonder in what quarter now the moon is:
    I praise your vast forbearance not to beat
      Me also, since the time so opportune is--
    Oh, valiant man! with sword drawn and cocked trigger,
    Now, tell me, don't you cut a pretty figure?

                      CLI.

    "Was it for this you took your sudden journey,
      Under pretence of business indispensable
    With that sublime of rascals your attorney,
      Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible
    Of having played the fool? though both I spurn, he
      Deserves the worst, his conduct's less defensible,
    Because, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee,
    And not from any love to you nor me.

                      CLII.

    "If he comes here to take a deposition,
      By all means let the gentleman proceed;
    You've made the apartment in a fit condition:--
      There's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need--
    Let everything be noted with precision,
      I would not you for nothing should be fee'd--
    But, as my maid's undressed, pray turn your spies out."
    "Oh!" sobbed Antonia, "I could tear their eyes out."

                      CLIII.

    "There is the closet, there the toilet, there
      The antechamber--search them under, over;
    There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,
      The chimney--which would really hold a lover.[ae]
    I wish to sleep, and beg you will take care
      And make no further noise, till you discover
    The secret cavern of this lurking treasure--
    And when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.

                      CLIV.

    "And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown
      Doubt upon me, confusion over all,
    Pray have the courtesy to make it known
      _Who_ is the man you search for? how d' ye call
    Him? what's his lineage? let him but be shown--
      I hope he's young and handsome--is he tall?
    Tell me--and be assured, that since you stain
    My honour thus, it shall not be in vain.

                      CLV.

    "At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,
      At that age he would be too old for slaughter,
    Or for so young a husband's jealous fears--
      (Antonia! let me have a glass of water.)
    I am ashamed of having shed these tears,
      They are unworthy of my father's daughter;
    My mother dreamed not in my natal hour,
    That I should fall into a monster's power.

                      CLVI.

    "Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,
      You saw that she was sleeping by my side,
    When you broke in upon us with your fellows:
      Look where you please--we've nothing, sir, to hide;
    Only another time, I trust, you'll tell us,
      Or for the sake of decency abide
    A moment at the door, that we may be
    Dressed to receive so much good company.

                      CLVII.

    "And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;
      The little I have said may serve to show
    The guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er[af]
      The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:--
    I leave you to your conscience as before,
      'T will one day ask you _why_ you used me so?
    God grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!--
    Antonia! where's my pocket-handkerchief?"

                      CLVIII.

    She ceased, and turned upon her pillow; pale
      She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,
    Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,
      Waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears
    Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail
      To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears
    Its snow through all;--her soft lips lie apart,
    And louder than her breathing beats her heart.

                      CLIX.

    The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;
      Antonia bustled round the ransacked room,
    And, turning up her nose, with looks abused
      Her master, and his myrmidons, of whom
    Not one, except the attorney, was amused;
      He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,
    So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,
    Knowing they must be settled by the laws.

                      CLX.

    With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,
      Following Antonia's motions here and there,
    With much suspicion in his attitude;
      For reputations he had little care;
    So that a suit or action were made good,
      Small pity had he for the young and fair,
    And ne'er believed in negatives, till these
    Were proved by competent false witnesses.

                      CLXI.

    But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,
      And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;
    When, after searching in five hundred nooks,
      And treating a young wife with so much rigour,
    He gained no point, except some self-rebukes,
      Added to those his lady with such vigour
    Had poured upon him for the last half-hour,
    Quick, thick, and heavy--as a thunder-shower.

                      CLXII.

    At first he tried to hammer an excuse,
      To which the sole reply was tears, and sobs,
    And indications of hysterics, whose
      Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,
    Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose:
      Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;[77]
    He saw too, in perspective, her relations,
    And then he tried to muster all his patience.

                      CLXIII.

    He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,
      But sage Antonia cut him short before
    The anvil of his speech received the hammer,
      With "Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,
    Or madam dies."--Alfonso muttered, "D--n her,"[78]
      But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;
    He cast a rueful look or two, and did,
    He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.

                      CLXIV.

    With him retired his _"posse comitatus,"_
      The attorney last, who lingered near the door
    Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as
      Antonia let him--not a little sore
    At this most strange and unexplained "_hiatus_"
      In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore
    An awkward look; as he revolved the case,
    The door was fastened in his legal face.

                      CLXV.

    No sooner was it bolted, than--Oh Shame!
      Oh Sin! Oh Sorrow! and Oh Womankind!
    How can you do such things and keep your fame,
      Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?
    Nothing so dear as an unfilched good name!
      But to proceed--for there is more behind:
    With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,
    Young Juan slipped, half-smothered, from the bed.

                      CLXVI.

    He had been hid--I don't pretend to say
      How, nor can I indeed describe the where--
    Young, slender, and packed easily, he lay,
      No doubt, in little compass, round or square;
    But pity him I neither must nor may
      His suffocation by that pretty pair;
    'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut
    With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.[ag]

                      CLXVII.

    And, secondly, I pity not, because
      He had no business to commit a sin,
    Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws;--
      At least 't was rather early to begin,
    But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws
      So much as when we call our old debts in
    At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,
    And find a deuced balance with the Devil.[ah]

                      CLXVIII.

    Of his position I can give no notion:
      'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,
    How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,
      Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,
    When old King David's blood grew dull in motion,
      And that the medicine answered very well;
    Perhaps 't was in a different way applied,
    For David lived, but Juan nearly died.

                      CLXIX.

    What's to be done? Alfonso will be back
      The moment he has sent his fools away.
    Antonia's skill was put upon the rack,
      But no device could be brought into play--
    And how to parry the renewed attack?
      Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:
    Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,
    But pressed her bloodless lip to Juan's cheek.

                      CLXX.

    He turned his lip to hers, and with his hand
      Called back the tangles of her wandering hair;
    Even then their love they could not all command,
      And half forgot their danger and despair:
    Antonia's patience now was at a stand--
      "Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,"
    She whispered, in great wrath--"I must deposit
    This pretty gentleman within the closet:

                      CLXXI.

    "Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night--
      _Who_ can have put my master in this mood?
    What will become on 't--I'm in such a fright,
      The Devil's in the urchin, and no good--
    Is this a time for giggling? this a plight?
      Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?
    You'll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,
    My mistress all, for that half-girlish face.

                      CLXXII.

    "Had it but been for a stout cavalier[79]
      Of twenty-five or thirty--(come, make haste)
    But for a child, what piece of work is here!
      I really, madam, wonder at your taste--
    (Come, sir, get in)--my master must be near:
      There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,
    And if we can but till the morning keep
    Our counsel--(Juan, mind, you must not sleep.)"

                      CLXXIII.

    Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,
      Closed the oration of the trusty maid:
    She loitered, and he told her to be gone,
      An order somewhat sullenly obeyed;
    However, present remedy was none,
      And no great good seemed answered if she staid:
    Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,
    She snuffed the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.

                      CLXXIV.

    Alfonso paused a minute--then begun
      Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;
    He would not justify what he had done,
      To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;
    But there were ample reasons for it, none
      Of which he specified in this his pleading:
    His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,
    Of rhetoric, which the learned call "_rigmarole._"

                      CLXXV.

    Julia said nought; though all the while there rose
      A ready answer, which at once enables
    A matron, who her husband's foible knows,
      By a few timely words to turn the tables,
    Which, if it does not silence, still must pose,--
      Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;
    'T is to retort with firmness, and when he
    Suspects with _one_, do you reproach with _three_.

                      CLXXVI.

    Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,--
      Alfonso's loves with Inez were well known;
    But whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds--
      But that can't be, as has been often shown,
    A lady with apologies abounds;--
      It might be that her silence sprang alone
    From delicacy to Don Juan's ear,
    To whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.

                      CLXXVII.

    There might be one more motive, which makes two;
      Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,--
    Mentioned his jealousy, but never who
      Had been the happy lover, he concluded,
    Concealed amongst his premises; 't is true,
      His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;
    To speak of Inez now were, one may say,
    Like throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.

                      CLXXVIII.

    A hint, in tender cases, is enough;
      Silence is best: besides, there is a _tact_[80]--
    (That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,
      But it will serve to keep my verse compact)--
    Which keeps, when pushed by questions rather rough,
      A lady always distant from the fact:
    The charming creatures lie with such a grace,
    There's nothing so becoming to the face.

                      CLXXIX.

    They blush, and we believe them; at least I
      Have always done so; 't is of no great use,
    In any case, attempting a reply,
      For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;
    And when at length they're out of breath, they sigh,
      And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose
    A tear or two, and then we make it up;
    And then--and then--and then--sit down and sup.

                      CLXXX.

    Alfonso closed his speech, and begged her pardon,
      Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,
    And laid conditions he thought very hard on,
      Denying several little things he wanted:
    He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,
      With useless penitence perplexed and haunted;[ai]
    Beseeching she no further would refuse,
    When, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes.

                      CLXXXI.

    A pair of shoes![81]--what then? not much, if they
      Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these
    (No one can tell how much I grieve to say)
      Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,
    Was but a moment's act.--Ah! well-a-day!
      My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze!
    Alfonso first examined well their fashion,
    And then flew out into another passion.

                      CLXXXII.

    He left the room for his relinquished sword,
      And Julia instant to the closet flew.
    "Fly, Juan, fly! for Heaven's sake--not a word--
      The door is open--you may yet slip through
    The passage you so often have explored--
      Here is the garden-key--Fly--fly--Adieu!
    Haste--haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet--
    Day has not broke--there's no one in the street."

                      CLXXXIII.

    None can say that this was not good advice,
      The only mischief was, it came too late;
    Of all experience 't is the usual price,
      A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:
    Juan had reached the room-door in a trice,
      And might have done so by the garden-gate,
    But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,
    Who threatened death--so Juan knocked him down.

                      CLXXXIV.

    Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;
      Antonia cried out "Rape!" and Julia "Fire!"
    But not a servant stirred to aid the fight.
      Alfonso, pommelled to his heart's desire,
    Swore lustily he'd be revenged this night;
      And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;
    His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,
    And not at all disposed to prove a martyr.

                      CLXXXV.

    Alfonso's sword had dropped ere he could draw it,
      And they continued battling hand to hand,
    For Juan very luckily ne'er saw it;
      His temper not being under great command,
    If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,
      Alfonso's days had not been in the land
    Much longer.--Think of husbands', lovers' lives!
    And how ye may be doubly widows--wives!

                      CLXXXVI.

    Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,
      And Juan throttled him to get away,
    And blood ('t was from the nose) began to flow;
      At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,
    Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,
      And then his only garment quite gave way;
    He fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,
    I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.

                      CLXXXVII.

    Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found
      An awkward spectacle their eyes before;
    Antonia in hysterics, Julia swooned,
      Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;
    Some half-torn drapery scattered on the ground,
      Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:
    Juan the gate gained, turned the key about,
    And liking not the inside, locked the out.

                      CLXXXVIII.

    Here ends this canto.--Need I sing, or say,
      How Juan, naked, favoured by the night,
    Who favours what she should not, found his way,[aj]
      And reached his home in an unseemly plight?
    The pleasant scandal which arose next day,
      The nine days' wonder which was brought to light,
    And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,
    Were in the English newspapers, of course.

                      CLXXXIX.

    If you would like to see the whole proceedings,
      The depositions, and the Cause at full,
    The names of all the witnesses, the pleadings
      Of Counsel to nonsuit, or to annul,
    There's more than one edition, and the readings
      Are various, but they none of them are dull:
    The best is that in short-hand ta'en by Gurney,[82]
    Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey.[83]

                      CXC.

    But Donna Inez, to divert the train
      Of one of the most circulating scandals
    That had for centuries been known in Spain,
      At least since the retirement of the Vandals,
    First vowed (and never had she vowed in vain)
      To Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;
    And then, by the advice of some old ladies,
    She sent her son to be shipped off from Cadiz.

                      CXCI.

    She had resolved that he should travel through
      All European climes, by land or sea,
    To mend his former morals, and get new,
      Especially in France and Italy--
    (At least this is the thing most people do.)
      Julia was sent into a convent--she
    Grieved--but, perhaps, her feelings may be better[ak]
    Shown in the following copy of her Letter:--

                      CXCII.

    "They tell me 't is decided you depart:
      'T is wise--'t is well, but not the less a pain;
    I have no further claim on your young heart,
      Mine is the victim, and would be again:
    To love too much has been the only art
      I used;--I write in haste, and if a stain
    Be on this sheet, 't is not what it appears;
    My eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.

                      CXCIII.

    "I loved, I love you, for this love have lost
      State, station, Heaven, Mankind's, my own esteem,
    And yet can not regret what it hath cost,
      So dear is still the memory of that dream;
    Yet, if I name my guilt, 't is not to boast,
      None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:
    I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest--
    I've nothing to reproach, or to request.

                      CXCIV.

    "Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,[al]
      'T is a Woman's whole existence; Man may range
    The Court, Camp, Church, the Vessel, and the Mart;
      Sword, Gown, Gain, Glory, offer in exchange
    Pride, Fame, Ambition, to fill up his heart,
      And few there are whom these can not estrange;
    Men have all these resources, We but one,[84]
    To love again, and be again undone."[am]

                      CXCV.

    "You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,[an]
      Beloved and loving many; all is o'er
    For me on earth, except some years to hide
      My shame and sorrow deep in my heart's core:
    These I could bear, but cannot cast aside
      The passion which still rages as before,--
    And so farewell--forgive me, love me--No,
    That word is idle now--but let it go.[ao]

                      CXCVI.

    "My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;
      But still I think I can collect my mind;[ap]
    My blood still rushes where my spirit's set,
      As roll the waves before the settled wind;
    My heart is feminine, nor can forget--
      To all, except one image, madly blind;
    So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,
    As vibrates my fond heart to my fixed soul.[aq]

                      CXCVII.

    "I have no more to say, but linger still,
      And dare not set my seal upon this sheet,
    And yet I may as well the task fulfil,
      My misery can scarce be more complete;
    I had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;
      Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,
    And I must even survive this last adieu,
    And bear with life, to love and pray for you!"

                      CXCVIII.

    This note was written upon gilt-edged paper
      With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new;[ar]
    Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,
      It trembled as magnetic needles do,
    And yet she did not let one tear escape her;
      The seal a sun-flower; _"Elle vous suit partout,"_[85]
    The motto cut upon a white cornelian;
    The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.

                      CXCIX.

    This was Don Juan's earliest scrape; but whether
      I shall proceed with his adventures is
    Dependent on the public altogether;
      We'll see, however, what they say to this:
    Their favour in an author's cap's a feather,
      And no great mischief's done by their caprice;
    And if their approbation we experience,
    Perhaps they'll have some more about a year hence.

                      CC.

    My poem's epic, and is meant to be
      Divided in twelve books; each book containing,
    With Love, and War, a heavy gale at sea,
      A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,
    New characters; the episodes are three:[as]
      A panoramic view of Hell's in training,
    After the style of Virgil and of Homer,
    So that my name of Epic's no misnomer.

                      CCI.

    All these things will be specified in time,
      With strict regard to Aristotle's rules,
    The _Vade Mecum_ of the true sublime,
      Which makes so many poets, and some fools:
    Prose poets like blank-verse, I'm fond of rhyme,
      Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;
    I've got new mythological machinery,
    And very handsome supernatural scenery.

                      CCII.

    There's only one slight difference between
      Me and my epic brethren gone before,
    And here the advantage is my own, I ween
      (Not that I have not several merits more,
    But this will more peculiarly be seen);
      They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore
    Their labyrinth of fables to thread through,
    Whereas this story's actually true.

                      CCIII.

    If any person doubt it, I appeal
      To History, Tradition, and to Facts,
    To newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,
      To plays in five, and operas in three acts;[at]
    All these confirm my statement a good deal,
      But that which more completely faith exacts
    Is, that myself, and several now in Seville,
    _Saw_ Juan's last elopement with the Devil.

                      CCIV.

    If ever I should condescend to prose,
      I'll write poetical commandments, which
    Shall supersede beyond all doubt all those
      That went before; in these I shall enrich
    My text with many things that no one knows,
      And carry precept to the highest pitch:
    I'll call the work "Longinus o'er a Bottle,[au]
    Or, Every Poet his _own_ Aristotle."

                      CCV.

    Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;
      Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;
    Because the first is crazed beyond all hope,
      The second drunk,[86] the third so quaint and mouthy:
    With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,
      And Campbell's Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:
    Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor
    Commit--flirtation with the muse of Moore.

                      CCVI.

    Thou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby's Muse,
      His Pegasus, nor anything that's his;
    Thou shalt not bear false witness like "the Blues"--
      (There's _one_, at least, is very fond of this);
    Thou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:
      This is true criticism, and you may kiss--
    Exactly as you please, or not,--the rod;
    But if you don't, I'll lay it on, by G--d!

                      CCVII.

    If any person should presume to assert
      This story is not moral, first, I pray,
    That they will not cry out before they're hurt,
      Then that they'll read it o'er again, and say
    (But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)
      That this is not a moral tale, though gay:
    Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show
    The very place where wicked people go.

                      CCVIII.

    If, after all, there should be some so blind
      To their own good this warning to despise,
    Led by some tortuosity of mind,
      Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,
    And cry that they "the moral cannot find,"
      I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;
    Should captains the remark, or critics, make,
    They also lie too--under a mistake.

                      CCIX.

    The public approbation I expect,
      And beg they'll take my word about the moral,
    Which I with their amusement will connect
      (So children cutting teeth receive a coral);
    Meantime they'll doubtless please to recollect
      My epical pretensions to the laurel:
    For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,
    I've bribed my Grandmother's Review--the British.[87]

                      CCX.

    I sent it in a letter to the Editor,
      Who thanked me duly by return of post--
    I'm for a handsome article his creditor;
      Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,
    And break a promise after having made it her,
      Denying the receipt of what it cost,
    And smear his page with gall instead of honey,
    All I can say is--that he had the money.

                      CCXI.

    I think that with this holy _new_ alliance
      I may ensure the public, and defy
    All other magazines of art or science,
      Daily, or monthly, or three monthly; I
    Have not essayed to multiply their clients,
      Because they tell me 't were in vain to try,
    And that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly
    Treat a dissenting author very martyrly.

                      CCXII.

    "_Non ego hoc ferrem calidus juventâ
      Consule Planco_"[88] Horace said, and so
    Say I; by which quotation there is meant a
      Hint that some six or seven good years ago
    (Long ere I dreamt of dating from the Brenta)
      I was most ready to return a blow,
    And would not brook at all this sort of thing
    In my hot youth--when George the Third was King.

                      CCXIII.

    But now at thirty years my hair is grey--
      (I wonder what it will be like at forty?
    I thought of a peruke the other day--)[av]
      My heart is not much greener; and, in short, I
    Have squandered my whole summer while 't was May,
      And feel no more the spirit to retort; I
    Have spent my life, both interest and principal,
    And deem not, what I deemed--my soul invincible.

                      CCXIV.

    No more--no more--Oh! never more on me
      The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,
    Which out of all the lovely things we see
      Extracts emotions beautiful and new,
    Hived[89] in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee.
      Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?
    Alas! 't was not in them, but in thy power
    To double even the sweetness of a flower.

                      CCXV.

    No more--no more--Oh! never more, my heart,
      Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!
    Once all in all, but now a thing apart,
      Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:
    The illusion's gone for ever, and thou art
      Insensible, I trust, but none the worse,
    And in thy stead I've got a deal of judgment,
    Though Heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.

                      CCXVI.

    My days of love are over; me no more[90]
      The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,
    Can make the fool of which they made before,--
      In short, I must not lead the life I did do;
    The credulous hope of mutual minds is o'er,
      The copious use of claret is forbid too,
    So for a good old-gentlemanly vice,
    I think I must take up with avarice.

                      CCXVII.

    Ambition was my idol, which was broken
      Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;
    And the two last have left me many a token
      O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:
    Now, like Friar Bacon's Brazen Head, I've spoken,
      "Time is, Time was, Time's past:"[91]--a chymic treasure
    Is glittering Youth, which I have spent betimes--
    My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.

                      CCXVIII.

    What is the end of Fame? 't is but to fill
      A certain portion of uncertain paper:
    Some liken it to climbing up a hill,
      Whose summit, like all hills, is lost in vapour;[92]
    For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,
      And bards burn what they call their "midnight taper,"
    To have, when the original is dust,
    A name, a wretched picture and worse bust.[aw][93]

                      CCXIX.

    What are the hopes of man? Old Egypt's King
      Cheops erected the first Pyramid
    And largest, thinking it was just the thing
      To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;
    But somebody or other rummaging,
      Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
    Let not a monument give you or me hopes,
    Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.[94]

                      CCXX.

    But I, being fond of true philosophy,
      Say very often to myself, "Alas!
    All things that have been born were born to die,
      And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;
    You've passed your youth not so unpleasantly,
      And if you had it o'er again--'t would pass--
    So thank your stars that matters are no worse,
    And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse."

                      CCXXI.

    But for the present, gentle reader! and
      Still gentler purchaser! the Bard--that's I--
    Must, with permission, shake you by the hand,[ax]
      And so--"your humble servant, and Good-bye!"
    We meet again, if we should understand
      Each other; and if not, I shall not try
    Your patience further than by this short sample--
    'T were well if others followed my example.

                      CCXXII.

    "Go, little Book, from this my solitude!
      I cast thee on the waters--go thy ways!
    And if, as I believe, thy vein be good,
      The World will find thee after many days."[95]
    When Southey's read, and Wordsworth understood,
      I can't help putting in my claim to praise--
    The four first rhymes are Southey's every line:
    For God's sake, reader! take them not for mine.

[15] [The pantomime which Byron and his readers "all had seen," was an
abbreviated and bowdlerized version of Shadwell's _Libertine_. "First
produced by Mr. Garrick on the boards of Drury Lane Theatre," it was
recomposed by Charles Anthony Delpini, and performed at the Royalty
Theatre, in Goodman's Fields, in 1787. It was entitled _Don Juan; or,
The Libertine Destroyed_: A Tragic Pantomimical Entertainment, In Two
Acts. Music Composed by Mr. Gluck. "Scaramouch," the "Sganarelle" of
Molière's _Festin de Pierre_, was a favourite character of Joseph
Grimaldi. He was cast for the part, in 1801, at Sadler's Wells, and,
again, on a memorable occasion, November 28, 1809, at Covent Garden
Theatre, when the O.P. riots were in full swing, and (see the _Morning
Chronicle_, November 29, 1809) "there was considerable tumult in the
pit." According to "Boz" (_Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi_, 1846, ii. 81,
106, 107), Byron patronized Grimaldi's "benefits at Covent Garden," was
repeatedly in his company, and when he left England, in 1816, "presented
him with a valuable silver snuff-box." At the end of the pantomime "the
Furies gather round him [Don Juan], and the Tyrant being bound in chains
is hurried away and thrown into flames." The Devil is conspicuous by his
absence.]

[18] ["In the eighth and concluding lecture of Mr. Hazlitt's canons of
criticism, delivered at the Surrey Institution (_The English Poets_,
1870, pp. 203, 204), I am accused of having 'lauded Buonaparte to the
skies in the hour of his success, and then peevishly wreaking my
disappointment on the god of my idolatry.' The first lines I ever wrote
upon Buonaparte were the 'Ode to Napoleon,' after his abdication in
1814. All that I have ever written on that subject has been done since
his decline;--I never 'met him in the hour of his success.' I have
considered his character at different periods, in its strength and in
its weakness: by his zealots I am accused of injustice--by his enemies
as his warmest partisan, in many publications, both English and foreign.

"For the accuracy of my delineation I have high authority. A year and
some months ago, I had the pleasure of seeing at Venice my friend the
honourable Douglas Kinnaird. In his way through Germany, he told me that
he had been honoured with a presentation to, and some interviews with,
one of the nearest family connections of Napoleon (Eugène Beauharnais).
During one of these, he read and translated the lines alluding to
Buonaparte, in the Third Canto of _Childe Harold_. He informed me, that
he was authorized by the illustrious personage--(still recognized as
such by the Legitimacy in Europe)--to whom they were read, to say, _that
'the delineation was complete,'_ or words to this effect. It is no
puerile vanity which induces me to publish this fact;--but Mr. Hazlitt
accuses my inconsistency, and infers my inaccuracy. Perhaps he will
admit that, with regard to the latter, one of the most intimate family
connections of the Emperor may be equally capable of deciding on the
subject. I tell Mr. Hazlitt that I never flattered Napoleon on the
throne, nor maligned him since his fall. I wrote what I think are the
incredible antitheses of his character.

"Mr. Hazlitt accuses me further of delineating _myself_ in _Childe
Harold_, etc., etc. I have denied this long ago--but, even were it true,
Locke tells us, that all his knowledge of human understanding was
derived from studying his own mind. From Mr. Hazlitt's opinion of my
poetry I do not appeal; but I request that gentleman not to insult me by
imputing the basest of crimes,--viz. 'praising publicly the same man
whom I wished to depreciate in his adversity:'--the _first_ lines I ever
wrote on Buonaparte were in his dispraise, in 1814,--the _last_, though
not at all in his favour, were more impartial and discriminative, in
1818. Has he become more fortunate since 1814?" For Byron's various
estimates of Napoleon's character and career, see _Childe Harold_, Canto
III, stanza xxxvi. line 7, _Poetical Works_, 1899, ii. 238, note 1.]

Robespierre, he was condemned to death, March 24, 1794. On the scaffold
he begged to be executed last, "in order to establish certain

somewhat disingenuously rebuts the charge that _Don Juan_ contained "an
elaborate satire on the character and manners of his wife." "If," he
writes, "in a poem by no means ascertained to be my production there
appears a disagreeable, casuistical, and by no means respectable female
pedant, it is set down for my wife. Is there any resemblance? If there
be, it is in those who make it--I can see none."--Letters, 1900, iv.

... on my household gods--did he think that, in less than three years, a
natural event--a severe, domestic, but an unexpected and common
calamity--would lay his carcase in a cross-road, or stamp his name in a
verdict of Lunacy! Did he (who in his drivelling sexagenary dotage had
not the courage to survive his Nurse--for what else was a wife to him at
his time of life?)--reflect or consider what _my_ feelings must have
been, when wife, and child, and sister, and name, and fame, and country,
were to be my sacrifice on his legal altar,--and this at a moment when
my health was declining, my fortune embarrassed, and my mind had been
shaken by many kinds of disappointment--while I was yet young, and might

surprised one day by a Doctor and a Lawyer almost forcing themselves at
the same time into my room. I did not know," he adds, "till afterwards
the real object of their visit. I thought their questions singular,
frivolous, and somewhat importunate, if not impertinent: but what should
I have thought, if I had known that they were sent to provide proofs of
my insanity?" Lady Byron, in her _Remarks on Mr. Moore's Life, etc_.
(_Life_, pp. 661-663), says that Dr. Baillie (_vide post_, p. 412, note
2), whom she consulted with regard to her husband's supposed insanity,
"not having had access to Lord Byron, could not pronounce a positive
opinion on this point." It appears, however, that another doctor, a Mr.
Le Mann (see _Letters_, 1899, iii. 293, note 1, 295, 299, etc.), visited
Byron professionally, and reported on his condition to Lady Byron.
Hence, perhaps, the mention of "druggists."]

The text is based on a second or revised copy of stanzas cxc.-cxcviii.
Many of the corrections and emendations which were inserted in the first
draft are omitted in the later and presumably improved version. Byron's
first intention was to insert seven stanzas after stanza clxxxix.,
descriptive and highly depreciatory of Brougham, but for reasons of
"fairness" (_vide infra_) he changed his mind. The casual mention of
"blundering Brougham" in _English Bards, etc._ (line 524, _Poetical
Works_, 1898, i. 338, note 2), is a proof that his suspicions were not
aroused as to the authorship of the review of _Hours of Idleness_
(_Edin. Rev._, January, 1808), and it is certain that Byron's animosity
was due to the part played by Brougham at the time of the Separation.
(In a letter to Byron, dated February 18, 1817, Murray speaks of a
certain B. "as your incessant persecutor--the source of all affected
public opinion respecting you.") The stanzas, with the accompanying

NOTE TO THE ANNEXED STANZAS ON BROUGHAM.

     "Distrusted by the Democracy, disliked by the Whigs, and detested
     by the Tories, too much of a lawyer for the people, and too much of
     a demagogue for Parliament, a contestor of counties, and a
     Candidate for cities, the refuse of half the Electors of England,
     and representative at last upon sufferance of the proprietor of
     some rotten borough, which it would have been more independent to
     have purchased, a speaker upon all questions, and the outcast of
     all parties, his support has become alike formidable to all his
     enemies (for he has no friends), and his vote can be only valuable
     when accompanied by his Silence. A disappointed man with a bad
     temper, he is endowed with considerable but not first-rate
     abilities, and has blundered on through life, remarkable only for a
     fluency, in which he has many rivals at the bar and in the Senate,
     and an eloquence in which he has several Superiors. 'Willing to
     wound and _not_ afraid to strike, until he receives a blow in
     return, he has not yet betrayed any illegal ardour, or Irish
     alacrity, in accepting the defiances, and resenting the disgraceful
     terms which his proneness to evil-speaking have (sic) brought upon
     him. In the cases of Mackinnon and Manners,[*E] he sheltered
     himself behind those parliamentary privileges, which Fox, Pitt,
     Canning, Castlereagh, Tierney, Adam, Shelburne, Grattan, Corry,
     Curran, and Clare disdained to adopt as their buckler. The House of
     Commons became the Asylum of his Slander, as the Churches of Rome
     were once the Sanctuary of Assassins.

     "His literary reputation (with the exception of one work of his
     early career) rests upon some anonymous articles imputed to him in
     a celebrated periodical work; but even these are surpassed by the
     Essays of others in the same Journal. He has tried every thing and
     succeeded in nothing; and he may perhaps finish as a Lawyer without
     practice, as he has already been occasionally an orator without an
     audience, if not soon cut short in his career.

     "The above character is _not_ written impartially, but by one who
     has had occasion to know some of the baser parts of it, and regards
     him accordingly with shuddering abhorrence, and just so much fear
     as he deserves. In him is to be dreaded the crawling of the
     centipede, not the spring of the tiger--the venom of the reptile,
     not the strength of the animal--the rancour of the miscreant, not
     the courage of the Man.

     "In case the prose or verse of the above should be actionable, I
     put my name, that the man may rather proceed against me than the
     publisher--not without some faint hope that the brand with which I
     blast him may induce him, however reluctantly, to a manlier
     revenge."

whose appointment to a foreign consulate Brougham sharply criticized in
the House of Commons, July 9, 1817 (_Parl. Deb._, vol. xxxvi. pp. 1320,
1321); and Daniel Mackinnon (1791-1836), the nephew of Henry Mackinnon,
who fell at Ciudad Rodrigo. Byron met "Dan" Mackinnon at Lisbon in 1809,
and (Gronow, _Reminiscences_, 1889, ii. 259, 260) was amused by his
"various funny stories."]

EXTRACT FROM LETTER TO MURRAY.

     "I enclose you the stanzas which were intended for 1st Canto, after
     the line

    'Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey:'

     but I do not mean them for present publication, because I will not,
     at this distance, publish _that_ of a Man, for which he has a claim
     upon another too remote to give him redress.

     "With regard to the Miscreant Brougham, however, it was only long
     after the fact, and I was made acquainted with the language he had
     held of me on my leaving England (with regard to the D^ss^ of D.'s
     house),[*F] and his letter to Me. de Staël, and various matters for
     all of which the first time he and I foregather--be it in England,
     be it on earth--he shall account, and one of the two be carried
     home.

     "As I have no wish to have mysteries, I merely prohibit the
     _publication_ of these stanzas in _print_, for the reasons of
     fairness mentioned; but I by no means wish _him not_ to _know_
     their existence or their tenor, nor my intentions as to himself: he
     has shown no forbearance, and he shall find none. You may show them
     to _him_ and to all whom it may concern, with the explanation that
     the only reason that I have not had satisfaction of this man has
     been, that I have never had an opportunity since I was aware of the
     facts, which my friends had carefully concealed from me; and it was
     only by slow degrees, and by piecemeal, that I got at them. I have
     not sought him, nor gone out of my way for him; but I will _find_
     him, and then we can have it out: he has shown so little courage,
     that he _must_ fight at last in his absolute necessity to escape
     utter degradation.

[86] [Here, and elsewhere in _Don Juan_, Byron attacked Coleridge
fiercely and venomously, because he believed that his _protégé_ had
accepted patronage and money, and, notwithstanding, had retailed
scandalous statements to the detriment and dishonour of his advocate and
benefactor (see letter to Murray, November 24, 1818, _Letters_, 1900,
iv. 272; and "Introduction to the _Vision of Judgment," Poetical Works_,
1901, iv. 475). Byron does not substantiate his charge of ingratitude,
and there is nothing to show whether Coleridge ever knew why a once
friendly countenance was changed towards him. He might have asked, with
the Courtenays, _Ubi lapsus, quid feci?_ If Byron had been on his mind
or his conscience he would have drawn up an elaborate explanation or
apology; but nothing of the kind is extant. He took the abuse as he had
taken the favours--for the unmerited gifts of the blind goddess Fortune.

enclosing a buffooning letter for publication, addressed to the buffoon
Roberts, who has thought proper to tie a canister to his own tail. It
was written off-hand, and in the midst of circumstances not very
favourable to facetiousness, so that there may, perhaps, be more
bitterness than enough for that sort of small acid punch." The letter
was in reply to a criticism of _Don Juan_ (Cantos I., II.) in the
_British Review_ (No. xxvii., 1819, vol. 14, pp. 266-268), in which the
Editor assumed, or feigned to assume, that the accusation of bribery was

King Cheops is said, by Herodotus, to have employed three hundred and
sixty thousand of his subjects for twenty years in raising over the
'angusta domus' destined to hold his remains, a pile of stone equal in
weight to six millions of tons, which is just three times that of the
vast Breakwater thrown across Plymouth Sound; and, to render this
precious dust still more secure, the narrow chamber was made accessible
only by small, intricate passages, obstructed by stones of an enormous
weight, and so carefully closed externally as not to be

                      II.

    Had he but been placed at a public school,
      In the third form, or even in the fourth,
    His daily task had kept his fancy cool,
      At least, had he been nurtured in the North;
    Spain may prove an exception to the rule,
      But then exceptions always prove its worth--
    A lad of sixteen causing a divorce
    Puzzled his tutors very much, of course.

                      III.

    I can't say that it puzzles me at all,
      If all things be considered: first, there was
    His lady-mother, mathematical,
      A----never mind;--his tutor, an old ass;
    A pretty woman--(that's quite natural,
      Or else the thing had hardly come to pass)
    A husband rather old, not much in unity
    With his young wife--a time, and opportunity.

                      IV.

    Well--well; the World must turn upon its axis,
      And all Mankind turn with it, heads or tails,
    And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,
      And as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails;
    The King commands us, and the Doctor quacks us,
      The Priest instructs, and so our life exhales,
    A little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,
    Fighting, devotion, dust,--perhaps a name.

                      V.

    I said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz--
      A pretty town, I recollect it well--
    'T is there the mart of the colonial trade is,
      (Or was, before Peru learned to rebel),
    And such sweet girls![97]--I mean, such graceful ladies,
      Their very walk would make your bosom swell;
    I can't describe it, though so much it strike,
    Nor liken it--I never saw the like:[az]

                      VI.

    An Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb
      New broke, a camelopard, a gazelle,
    No--none of these will do;--and then their garb,
      Their veil and petticoat--Alas! to dwell
    Upon such things would very near absorb
      A canto--then their feet and ankles,--well,
    Thank Heaven I've got no metaphor quite ready,
    (And so, my sober Muse--come, let's be steady--

                      VII.

    Chaste Muse!--well,--if you must, you must)--the veil
      Thrown back a moment with the glancing hand,
    While the o'erpowering eye, that turns you pale,
      Flashes into the heart:--All sunny land
    Of Love! when I forget you, may I fail
      To----say my prayers--but never was there planned
    A dress through which the eyes give such a volley,
    Excepting the Venetian Fazzioli.[98]
                      VIII.

    But to our tale: the Donna Inez sent
      Her son to Cadiz only to embark;
    To stay there had not answered her intent,
      But why?--we leave the reader in the dark--
    'T was for a voyage the young man was meant,
      As if a Spanish ship were Noah's ark,
    To wean him from the wickedness of earth,
    And send him like a Dove of Promise forth.

                      IX.

    Don Juan bade his valet pack his things
      According to direction, then received
    A lecture and some money: for four springs
      He was to travel; and though Inez grieved
    (As every kind of parting has its stings),
      She hoped he would improve--perhaps believed:
    A letter, too, she gave (he never read it)
    Of good advice--and two or three of credit.

                      X.

    In the mean time, to pass her hours away,
      Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school
    For naughty children, who would rather play
      (Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;
    Infants of three years old were taught that day,
      Dunces were whipped, or set upon a stool:
    The great success of Juan's education
    Spurred her to teach another generation.[ba]

                      XI.

    Juan embarked--the ship got under way,
      The wind was fair, the water passing rough;
    A devil of a sea rolls in that bay,
      As I, who've crossed it oft, know well enough;
    And, standing on the deck, the dashing spray
      Flies in one's face, and makes it weather-tough:
    And there he stood to take, and take again,
    His first--perhaps his last--farewell of Spain.

                      XII.

    I can't but say it is an awkward sight
      To see one's native land receding through
    The growing waters; it unmans one quite,
      Especially when life is rather new:
    I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,[99]
      But almost every other country's blue,
    When gazing on them, mystified by distance,
    We enter on our nautical existence.

                      XIII.

    So Juan stood, bewildered on the deck:
      The wind sung, cordage strained, and sailors swore,
    And the ship creaked, the town became a speck,
      From which away so fair and fast they bore.
    The best of remedies is a beef-steak
      Against sea-sickness: try it, Sir, before
    You sneer, and I assure you this is true,
    For I have found it answer--so may you.

                      XIV.

    Don Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,
      Beheld his native Spain receding far:
    First partings form a lesson hard to learn,
      Even nations feel this when they go to war;
    There is a sort of unexpressed concern,
      A kind of shock that sets one's heart ajar,
    At leaving even the most unpleasant people
    And places--one keeps looking at the steeple.

                      XV.

    But Juan had got many things to leave,
      His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,
    So that he had much better cause to grieve
      Than many persons more advanced in life:
    And if we now and then a sigh must heave
      At quitting even those we quit in strife,
    No doubt we weep for those the heart endears--
    That is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.

                      XVI.

    So Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews
      By Babel's waters, still remembering Sion:
    I'd weep,--but mine is not a weeping Muse,
      And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;
    Young men should travel, if but to amuse
      Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on
    Behind their carriages their new portmanteau,
    Perhaps it may be lined with this my canto.

                      XVII.

    And Juan wept, and much he sighed and thought,
      While his salt tears dropped into the salt sea,
    "Sweets to the sweet;" (I like so much to quote;
      You must excuse this extract,--'t is where she,
    The Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought
      Flowers to the grave;) and, sobbing often, he
    Reflected on his present situation,
    And seriously resolved on reformation.

                      XVIII.

    "Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!" he cried,
      "Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,
    But die, as many an exiled heart hath died,
      Of its own thirst to see again thy shore:
    Farewell, where Guadalquivir's waters glide!
      Farewell, my mother! and, since all is o'er,
    Farewell, too, dearest Julia!--(here he drew
    Her letter out again, and read it through.)

                      XIX.

    "And oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear--
      But that's impossible, and cannot be--
    Sooner shall this blue Ocean melt to air,
      Sooner shall Earth resolve itself to sea,
    Than I resign thine image, oh, my fair!
      Or think of anything, excepting thee;
    A mind diseased no remedy can physic--
    (Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick.)

                      XX.

    "Sooner shall Heaven kiss earth--(here he fell sicker)
      Oh, Julia! what is every other woe?--
    (For God's sake let me have a glass of liquor;
      Pedro, Battista, help me down below.)
    Julia, my love!--(you rascal, Pedro, quicker)--
      Oh, Julia!--(this curst vessel pitches so)--
    Belovéd Julia, hear me still beseeching!"
    (Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)

                      XXI.

    He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,
      Or rather stomach, which, alas! attends,
    Beyond the best apothecary's art,
      The loss of Love, the treachery of friends,
    Or death of those we dote on, when a part
      Of us dies with them as each fond hope ends:
    No doubt he would have been much more pathetic,
    But the sea acted as a strong emetic.

                      XXII.

    Love's a capricious power: I've known it hold
      Out through a fever caused by its own heat,
    But be much puzzled by a cough and cold,
      And find a quinsy very hard to treat;
    Against all noble maladies he's bold,
      But vulgar illnesses don't like to meet,
    Nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,
    Nor inflammations redden his blind eye.

                      XXIII.

    But worst of all is nausea, or a pain
      About the lower region of the bowels;
    Love, who heroically breathes a vein,[100]
      Shrinks from the application of hot towels,
    And purgatives are dangerous to his reign,
      Sea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else[bb]
    Could Juan's passion, while the billows roar,
    Resist his stomach, ne'er at sea before?

                      XXIV.

    The ship, called the most holy "Trinidada,"[101]
      Was steering duly for the port Leghorn;
    For there the Spanish family Moncada
      Were settled long ere Juan's sire was born:
    They were relations, and for them he had a
      Letter of introduction, which the morn
    Of his departure had been sent him by
    His Spanish friends for those in Italy.

                      XXV.

    His suite consisted of three servants and
      A tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,
    Who several languages did understand,
      But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow
    And, rocking in his hammock, longed for land,
      His headache being increased by every billow;
    And the waves oozing through the port-hole made
    His berth a little damp, and him afraid.

                      XXVI.

    'T was not without some reason, for the wind
      Increased at night, until it blew a gale;
    And though 't was not much to a naval mind,
      Some landsmen would have looked a little pale,
    For sailors are, in fact, a different kind:
      At sunset they began to take in sail,
    For the sky showed it would come on to blow,
    And carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.

                      XXVII.

    At one o'clock the wind with sudden shift
      Threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,
    Which struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,
      Started the stern-post, also shattered the
    Whole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift
      Herself from out her present jeopardy,
    The rudder tore away: 't was time to sound
    The pumps, and there were four feet water found.

                      XXVIII.

    One gang of people instantly was put
      Upon the pumps, and the remainder set
    To get up part of the cargo, and what not;
      But they could not come at the leak as yet;
    At last they did get at it really, but
      Still their salvation was an even bet:
    The water rushed through in a way quite puzzling,
    While they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,

                      XXIX.

    Into the opening; but all such ingredients
      Would have been vain, and they must have gone down,
    Despite of all their efforts and expedients,
      But for the pumps: I'm glad to make them known
    To all the brother tars who may have need hence,
      For fifty tons of water were upthrown
    By them per hour, and they had all been undone,
    But for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.[102]

                      XXX.

    As day advanced the weather seemed to abate,
      And then the leak they reckoned to reduce,
    And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet
      Kept two hand--and one chain-pump still in use.
    The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late
      A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,
    A gust--which all descriptive power transcends--
    Laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.

                      XXXI.

    There she lay, motionless, and seemed upset;
      The water left the hold, and washed the decks,
    And made a scene men do not soon forget;
      For they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,
    Or any other thing that brings regret
      Or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:
    Thus drownings are much talked of by the divers,
    And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.

                      XXXII.

    Immediately the masts were cut away,
      Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,
    The main-mast followed: but the ship still lay
      Like a mere log, and baffled our intent.
    Foremast and bowsprit were cut down, and they
      Eased her at last (although we never meant
    To part with all till every hope was blighted),
    And then with violence the old ship righted.[103]

                      XXXIII.

    It may be easily supposed, while this
      Was going on, some people were unquiet,
    That passengers would find it much amiss
      To lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;
    That even the able seaman, deeming his
      Days nearly o'er, might be disposed to riot,
    As upon such occasions tars will ask
    For grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.

                      XXXIV.

    There's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms
      As rum and true religion: thus it was,
    Some plundered, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,
      The high wind made the treble, and as bass
    The hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms
      Of all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:
    Strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,
    Clamoured in chorus to the roaring Ocean.

                      XXXV.

    Perhaps more mischief had been done, but for[bc]
      Our Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,
    Got to the spirit-room, and stood before
      It with a pair of pistols;[104] and their fears,
    As if Death were more dreadful by his door
      Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,
    Kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,
    Thought it would be becoming to die drunk.

                      XXXVI.

    "Give us more grog," they cried, "for it will be
      All one an hour hence." Juan answered, "No!
    'T is true that Death awaits both you and me,
      But let us die like men, not sink below
    Like brutes:"--and thus his dangerous post kept he,
      And none liked to anticipate the blow;
    And even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,
    Was for some rum a disappointed suitor.

                      XXXVII.

    The good old gentleman was quite aghast,
      And made a loud and pious lamentation;
    Repented all his sins, and made a last
      Irrevocable vow of reformation;
    Nothing should tempt him more (this peril past)
      To quit his academic occupation,
    In cloisters of the classic Salamanca,
    To follow Juan's wake, like Sancho Panca.

                      XXXVIII.

    But now there came a flash of hope once more;
      Day broke, and the wind lulled: the masts were gone
    The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,
      The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.[105]
    They tried the pumps again, and though before
      Their desperate efforts seemed all useless grown,
    A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale--
    The stronger pumped, the weaker thrummed a sail.

                      XXXIX.

    Under the vessel's keel the sail was passed,
      And for the moment it had some effect;
    But with a leak, and not a stick of mast,
      Nor rag of canvas, what could they expect?
    But still 't is best to struggle to the last,
      'T is never too late to be wholly wrecked:
    And though 't is true that man can only die once,
    'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.[bd]

                      XL.

    There winds and waves had hurled them, and from thence,
      Without their will, they carried them away;
    For they were forced with steering to dispense,
      And never had as yet a quiet day
    On which they might repose, or even commence
      A jurymast or rudder, or could say
    The ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,
    Still swam--though not exactly like a duck.

                      XLI.

    The wind, in fact, perhaps, was rather less,
      But the ship laboured so, they scarce could hope
    To weather out much longer; the distress
      Was also great with which they had to cope
    For want of water, and their solid mess
      Was scant enough: in vain the telescope
    Was used--nor sail nor shore appeared in sight,
    Nought but the heavy sea, and coming night.

                      XLII.

    Again the weather threatened,--again blew
      A gale, and in the fore and after hold
    Water appeared; yet, though the people knew
      All this, the most were patient, and some bold,
    Until the chains and leathers were worn through
      Of all our pumps:--a wreck complete she rolled,
    At mercy of the waves, whose mercies are
    Like human beings during civil war.

                      XLIII.

    Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears
      In his rough eyes, and told the captain, he
    Could do no more: he was a man in years,
      And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,
    And if he wept at length they were not fears
      That made his eyelids as a woman's be,
    But he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,--
    Two things for dying people quite bewildering.

                      XLIV.

    The ship was evidently settling now
      Fast by the head; and, all distinction gone,
    Some went to prayers again, and made a vow
      Of candles to their saints[106]--but there were none
    To pay them with; and some looked o'er the bow;
      Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one
    That begged Pedrillo for an absolution,
    Who told him to be damned--in his confusion.[107]

                      XLV.

    Some lashed them in their hammocks; some put on
      Their best clothes, as if going to a fair;
    Some cursed the day on which they saw the Sun,
      And gnashed their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;
    And others went on as they had begun,
      Getting the boats out, being well aware
    That a tight boat will live in a rough sea,
    Unless with breakers close beneath her lee.[108]

                      XLVI.

    The worst of all was, that in their condition,
      Having been several days in great distress,
    'T was difficult to get out such provision
      As now might render their long suffering less:
    Men, even when dying, dislike inanition;[be]
      Their stock was damaged by the weather's stress:
    Two casks of biscuit, and a keg of butter,
    Were all that could be thrown into the cutter.

                      XLVII.

    But in the long-boat they contrived to stow
      Some pounds of bread, though injured by the wet;
    Water, a twenty-gallon cask or so;
      Six flasks of wine; and they contrived to get
    A portion of their beef up from below,[109]
      And with a piece of pork, moreover, met,
    But scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon--
    Then there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.

                      XLVIII.

    The other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had
      Been stove in the beginning of the gale;[110]
    And the long-boat's condition was but bad,
      As there were but two blankets for a sail,[111]
    And one oar for a mast, which a young lad
      Threw in by good luck over the ship's rail;
    And two boats could not hold, far less be stored,
    To save one half the people then on board.

                      XLIX.

    'T was twilight, and the sunless day went down
      Over the waste of waters; like a veil,
    Which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown[bf]
      Of one whose hate is masked but to assail.
    Thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,
      And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,
    And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear[bg]
    Been their familiar, and now Death was here.

                      L.

    Some trial had been making at a raft,
      With little hope in such a rolling sea,
    A sort of thing at which one would have laughed,[112]
      If any laughter at such times could be,
    Unless with people who too much have quaffed,
      And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,
    Half epileptical, and half hysterical:--
    Their preservation would have been a miracle.

                      LI.

    At half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,
      And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,
    That still could keep afloat the struggling tars,[113]
      For yet they strove, although of no great use:
    There was no light in heaven but a few stars,
      The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;
    She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,
    And, going down head foremost--sunk, in short.[114]

                      LII.

    Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell--
      Then shrieked the timid, and stood still the brave,--
    Then some leaped overboard with dreadful yell,[115]
      As eager to anticipate their grave;
    And the sea yawned around her like a hell,
      And down she sucked with her the whirling wave,
    Like one who grapples with his enemy,
    And strives to strangle him before he die.

                      LIII.

    And first one universal shriek there rushed,
      Louder than the loud Ocean, like a crash
    Of echoing thunder; and then all was hushed,
      Save the wild wind and the remorseless dash
    Of billows; but at intervals there gushed,
      Accompanied by a convulsive splash,
    A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry
    Of some strong swimmer in his agony.

                      LIV.

    The boats, as stated, had got off before,
      And in them crowded several of the crew;
    And yet their present hope was hardly more
      Than what it had been, for so strong it blew
    There was slight chance of reaching any shore;
      And then they were too many, though so few--
    Nine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,
    Were counted in them when they got afloat.

                      LV.

    All the rest perished; near two hundred souls
      Had left their bodies; and what's worse, alas!
    When over Catholics the Ocean rolls,
      They must wait several weeks before a mass
    Takes off one peck of purgatorial coals,
      Because, till people know what's come to pass,
    They won't lay out their money on the dead--
    It costs three francs for every mass that's said.

                      LVI.

    Juan got into the long-boat, and there
      Contrived to help Pedrillo to a place;
    It seemed as if they had exchanged their care,
      For Juan wore the magisterial face
    Which courage gives, while poor Pedrillo's pair
      Of eyes were crying for their owner's case:
    Battista, though, (a name called shortly Tita),
    Was lost by getting at some aqua-vita.

                      LVII.

    Pedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,
      But the same cause, conducive to his loss,
    Left him so drunk, he jumped into the wave,
      As o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,
    And so he found a wine-and-watery grave;
      They could not rescue him although so close,
    Because the sea ran higher every minute,
    And for the boat--the crew kept crowding in it.

                      LVIII.

    A small old spaniel,--which had been Don José's,
      His father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,
    For on such things the memory reposes
      With tenderness--stood howling on the brink,
    Knowing, (dogs have such intellectual noses!)
      No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;
    And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepped
    Off threw him in, then after him he leaped.[116]

                      LIX.

    He also stuffed his money where he could
      About his person, and Pedrillo's too,
    Who let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,
      Not knowing what himself to say, or do,
    As every rising wave his dread renewed;
      But Juan, trusting they might still get through,
    And deeming there were remedies for any ill,
    Thus re-embarked his tutor and his spaniel.

                      LX.

    'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,
      That the sail was becalmed between the seas,[117]
    Though on the wave's high top too much to set,
      They dared not take it in for all the breeze:
    Each sea curled o'er the stern, and kept them wet,
      And made them bale without a moment's ease,[118]
    So that themselves as well as hopes were damped,
    And the poor little cutter quickly swamped.

                      LXI.

    Nine souls more went in her: the long-boat still
      Kept above water, with an oar for mast,
    Two blankets stitched together, answering ill
      Instead of sail, were to the oar made fast;
    Though every wave rolled menacing to fill,
      And present peril all before surpassed,[119]
    They grieved for those who perished with the cutter,
    And also for the biscuit-casks and butter.

                      LXII.

    The sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign
      Of the continuance of the gale: to run
    Before the sea until it should grow fine,
      Was all that for the present could be done:
    A few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine
      Were served out to the people, who begun[120]
    To faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags,
    And most of them had little clothes but rags.

                      LXIII.

    They counted thirty, crowded in a space
      Which left scarce room for motion or exertion;
    They did their best to modify their case,
      One half sate up, though numbed with the immersion,
    While t' other half were laid down in their place,
      At watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian
    Ague in its cold fit, they filled their boat,
    With nothing but the sky for a great coat.[121]

                      LXIV.

    'T is very certain the desire of life
      Prolongs it: this is obvious to physicians,
    When patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,
      Survive through very desperate conditions,
    Because they still can hope, nor shines the knife
      Nor shears of Atropos before their visions:
    Despair of all recovery spoils longevity,
    And makes men's misery of alarming brevity.

                      LXV.

    'T is said that persons living on annuities
      Are longer lived than others,--God knows why,
    Unless to plague the grantors,--yet so true it is,
      That some, I really think, _do_ never die:
    Of any creditors the worst a Jew it is,
      And _that's_ their mode of furnishing supply:
    In my young days they lent me cash that way,
    Which I found very troublesome to pay.[122]

                      LXVI.

    'T is thus with people in an open boat,
      They live upon the love of Life, and bear
    More than can be believed, or even thought,
      And stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;
    And hardship still has been the sailor's lot,
      Since Noah's ark went cruising here and there;
    She had a curious crew as well as cargo,
    Like the first old Greek privateer, the Argo.

                      LXVII.

    But man is a carnivorous production,
      And must have meals, at least one meal a day;
    He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,
      But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;
    Although his anatomical construction
      Bears vegetables, in a grumbling way,
    Your labouring people think, beyond all question,
    Beef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.

                      LXVIII.

    And thus it was with this our hapless crew;
      For on the third day there came on a calm,
    And though at first their strength it might renew,
      And lying on their weariness like balm,
    Lulled them like turtles sleeping on the blue
      Of Ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,
    And fell all ravenously on their provision,
    Instead of hoarding it with due precision.

                      LXIX.

    The consequence was easily foreseen--
      They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,
    In spite of all remonstrances, and then
      On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?
    They hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!
      And carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,
    But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,
    It would have been more wise to save their victual.

                      LXX.

    The fourth day came, but not a breath of air,
      And Ocean slumbered like an unweaned child:
    The fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,
      The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild--
    With their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)
      What could they do? and Hunger's rage grew wild:
    So Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,
    Was killed, and portioned out for present eating.[123]

                      LXXI.


    On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,
      And Juan, who had still refused, because
    The creature was his father's dog that died,
      Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,
    With some remorse received (though first denied)
      As a great favour one of the fore-paws,[124]
    Which he divided with Pedrillo, who
    Devoured it, longing for the other too.

                      LXXII.

    The seventh day, and no wind--the burning sun
      Blistered and scorched, and, stagnant on the sea,
    They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,
      Save in the breeze that came not: savagely
    They glared upon each other--all was done,
      Water, and wine, and food,--and you might see
    The longings of the cannibal arise
    (Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.

                      LXXIII.

    At length one whispered his companion, who
      Whispered another, and thus it went round,
    And then into a hoarser murmur grew,
      An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;
    And when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,
      'T was but his own, suppressed till now, he found:
    And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,
    And who should die to be his fellow's food.

                      LXXIV.

    But ere they came to this, they that day shared
      Some leathern caps, and what remained of shoes;
    And then they looked around them, and despaired,
      And none to be the sacrifice would choose;
    At length the lots were torn up,[125] and prepared,
      But of materials that must shock the Muse--
    Having no paper, for the want of better,
    They took by force from Juan Julia's letter.

                      LXXV.

    The lots were made, and marked, and mixed, and handed,
      In silent horror,[126] and their distribution
    Lulled even the savage hunger which demanded,
      Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;
    None in particular had sought or planned it,
      'T was Nature gnawed them to this resolution,
    By which none were permitted to be neuter--
    And the lot fell on Juan's luckless tutor.

                      LXXVI.

    He but requested to be bled to death:
      The surgeon had his instruments, and bled[127]
    Pedrillo, and so gently ebbed his breath,
      You hardly could perceive when he was dead.
    He died as born, a Catholic in faith,
      Like most in the belief in which they're bred,
    And first a little crucifix he kissed,
    And then held out his jugular and wrist.

                      LXXVII.

    The surgeon, as there was no other fee,
      Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;
    But being thirstiest at the moment, he
      Preferred a draught from the fast-flowing veins:[128]
    Part was divided, part thrown in the sea,
      And such things as the entrails and the brains
    Regaled two sharks, who followed o'er the billow--
    The sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.

                      LXXVIII.

    The sailors ate him, all save three or four,
      Who were not quite so fond of animal food;
    To these was added Juan, who, before
      Refusing his own spaniel, hardly could
    Feel now his appetite increased much more;
      'T was not to be expected that he should,
    Even in extremity of their disaster,
    Dine with them on his pastor and his master.

                      LXXIX.

    'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,
      The consequence was awful in the extreme;
    For they, who were most ravenous in the act,
      Went raging mad[129]--Lord! how they did blaspheme!
    And foam, and roll, with strange convulsions racked,
      Drinking salt-water like a mountain-stream,
    Tearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,
    And, with hyæna-laughter, died despairing.

                      LXXX.

    Their numbers were much thinned by this infliction,
      And all the rest were thin enough, Heaven knows;
    And some of them had lost their recollection,
      Happier than they who still perceived their woes;
    But others pondered on a new dissection,
      As if not warned sufficiently by those
    Who had already perished, suffering madly,
    For having used their appetites so sadly.

                      LXXXI.

    And next they thought upon the master's mate,
      As fattest; but he saved himself, because,
    Besides being much averse from such a fate,
      There were some other reasons: the first was,
    He had been rather indisposed of late;
      And--that which chiefly proved his saving clause--
    Was a small present made to him at Cadiz,
    By general subscription of the ladies.

                      LXXXII.

    Of poor Pedrillo something still remained,
      But was used sparingly,--some were afraid,
    And others still their appetites constrained,
      Or but at times a little supper made;
    All except Juan, who throughout abstained,
      Chewing a piece of bamboo, and some lead:[130]
    At length they caught two Boobies, and a Noddy,[131]
    And then they left off eating the dead body.

                      LXXXIII.

    And if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,
      Remember Ugolino[132] condescends
    To eat the head of his arch-enemy
      The moment after he politely ends
    His tale: if foes be food in Hell, at sea
      'T is surely fair to dine upon our friends,
    When Shipwreck's short allowance grows too scanty,
    Without being much more horrible than Dante.

                      LXXXIV.

    And the same night there fell a shower of rain,
      For which their mouths gaped, like the cracks of earth
    When dried to summer dust; till taught by pain,
      Men really know not what good water's worth;
    If you had been in Turkey or in Spain,
      Or with a famished boat's-crew had your berth,
    Or in the desert heard the camel's bell,
    You'd wish yourself where Truth is--in a well.

                      LXXXV.

    It poured down torrents, but they were no richer
      Until they found a ragged piece of sheet,
    Which served them as a sort of spongy pitcher,
      And when they deemed its moisture was complete,
    They wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher[133]
      Might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet
    As a full pot of porter, to their thinking
    They ne'er till now had known the joys of drinking.

                      LXXXVI.

    And their baked lips, with many a bloody crack,[134]
      Sucked in the moisture, which like nectar streamed;
    Their throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,
      As the rich man's in Hell, who vainly screamed
    To beg the beggar, who could not rain back
    A drop of dew, when every drop had seemed
    To taste of Heaven--If this be true, indeed,
    Some Christians have a comfortable creed.

                      LXXXVII.

    There were two fathers in this ghastly crew,
      And with them their two sons, of whom the one
    Was more robust and hardy to the view,
      But he died early; and when he was gone,
    His nearest messmate told his sire, who threw
      One glance at him, and said, "Heaven's will be done!
    I can do nothing," and he saw him thrown
    Into the deep without a tear or groan.[135]

                      LXXXVIII.

    The other father had a weaklier child,
      Of a soft cheek, and aspect delicate;[136]
    But the boy bore up long, and with a mild
      And patient spirit held aloof his fate;
    Little he said, and now and then he smiled,
      As if to win a part from off the weight
    He saw increasing on his father's heart,
    With the deep deadly thought, that they must part.

                      LXXXIX.

    And o'er him bent his sire, and never raised
      His eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam
    From his pale lips, and ever on him gazed,
      And when the wished-for shower at length was come,
    And the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,
      Brightened, and for a moment seemed to roam,
    He squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain
    Into his dying child's mouth--but in vain.[137]

                      XC.

    The boy expired--the father held the clay,
      And looked upon it long, and when at last
    Death left no doubt, and the dead burthen lay
      Stiff on his heart, and pulse and hope were past,
    He watched it wistfully, until away
      'T was borne by the rude wave wherein't was cast;[138]
    Then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering,
    And gave no sign of life, save his limbs quivering.

                      XCI.

    Now overhead a rainbow, bursting through
      The scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea,
    Resting its bright base on the quivering blue;
      And all within its arch appeared to be
    Clearer than that without, and its wide hue
      Waxed broad and waving, like a banner free,
    Then changed like to a bow that's bent, and then
    Forsook the dim eyes of these shipwrecked men.

                      XCII.

    It changed, of course; a heavenly Chameleon,
      The airy child of vapour and the sun,
    Brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,
      Baptized in molten gold, and swathed in dun,
    Glittering like crescents o'er a Turk's pavilion,
      And blending every colour into one,
    Just like a black eye in a recent scuffle
    (For sometimes we must box without the muffle).

                      XCIII.

    Our shipwrecked seamen thought it a good omen--
      It is as well to think so, now and then;
    'T was an old custom of the Greek and Roman,
      And may become of great advantage when
    Folks are discouraged; and most surely no men
      Had greater need to nerve themselves again
    Than these, and so this rainbow looked like Hope--
    Quite a celestial Kaleidoscope.

                      XCIV.

    About this time a beautiful white bird,
      Webfooted, not unlike a dove in size
    And plumage (probably it might have erred
      Upon its course), passed oft before their eyes,
    And tried to perch, although it saw and heard
      The men within the boat, and in this guise
    It came and went, and fluttered round them till
    Night fell:--this seemed a better omen still.[139]

                      XCV.

    But in this case I also must remark,
      'T was well this bird of promise did not perch,
    Because the tackle of our shattered bark
      Was not so safe for roosting as a church;
    And had it been the dove from Noah's ark,
      Returning there from her successful search,
    Which in their way that moment chanced to fall,
    They would have eat her, olive-branch and all.

                      XCVI.

    With twilight it again came on to blow,
      But not with violence; the stars shone out,
    The boat made way; yet now they were so low,
      They knew not where nor what they were about;
    Some fancied they saw land, and some said "No!"
      The frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt--
    Some swore that they heard breakers, others guns,[140]
    And all mistook about the latter once.

                      XCVII.

    As morning broke, the light wind died away,
      When he who had the watch sung out and swore,
    If 't was not land that rose with the Sun's ray,
      He wished that land he never might see more;[141]
    And the rest rubbed their eyes and saw a bay,
      Or thought they saw, and shaped their course for shore;
    For shore it was, and gradually grew
    Distinct, and high, and palpable to view.

                      XCVIII.

    And then of these some part burst into tears,
      And others, looking with a stupid stare,[142]
    Could not yet separate their hopes from fears,
      And seemed as if they had no further care;
    While a few prayed--(the first time for some years)--
      And at the bottom of the boat three were
    Asleep: they shook them by the hand and head,
    And tried to awaken them, but found them dead.

                      XCIX.

    The day before, fast sleeping on the water,
      They found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,
    And by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,[143]
    Which yielded a day's life, and to their mind
    Proved even still a more nutritious matter,
      Because it left encouragement behind:
    They thought that in such perils, more than chance
    Had sent them this for their deliverance.

                      C.

    The land appeared a high and rocky coast,
      And higher grew the mountains as they drew,
    Set by a current, toward it: they were lost
      In various conjectures, for none knew
    To what part of the earth they had been tost,
      So changeable had been the winds that blew;
    Some thought it was Mount Ætna, some the highlands
    Of Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, or other islands.

                      CI.

    Meantime the current, with a rising gale,
      Still set them onwards to the welcome shore,
    Like Charon's bark of spectres, dull and pale:
      Their living freight was now reduced to four,
    And three dead, whom their strength could not avail
      To heave into the deep with those before,
    Though the two sharks still followed them, and dashed
    The spray into their faces as they splashed.

                      CII.

    Famine--despair--cold--thirst and heat, had done
      Their work on them by turns, and thinned them to
    Such things a mother had not known her son
      Amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew;[144]
    By night chilled, by day scorched, thus one by one
      They perished, until withered to these few,
    But chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,
    In washing down Pedrillo with salt water.

                      CII.

    As they drew nigh the land, which now was seen
      Unequal in its aspect here and there,
    They felt the freshness of its growing green,
      That waved in forest-tops, and smoothed the air,
    And fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen
      From glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare--
    Lovely seemed any object that should sweep
    Away the vast--salt--dread--eternal Deep.

                      CIV.

    The shore looked wild, without a trace of man,
     And girt by formidable waves; but they
    Were mad for land, and thus their course they ran,
      Though right ahead the roaring breakers lay:
    A reef between them also now began
      To show its boiling surf and bounding spray,
    But finding no place for their landing better,
    They ran the boat for shore,--and overset her.[145]

                      CV.

    But in his native stream, the Guadalquivir,
      Juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont;
    And having learnt to swim in that sweet river,
      Had often turned the art to some account:
    A better swimmer you could scarce see ever,
      He could, perhaps, have passed the Hellespont,
    As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)
    Leander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.[146]

                      CVI.

    So here, though faint, emaciated, and stark,
      He buoyed his boyish limbs, and strove to ply
    With the quick wave, and gain, ere it was dark,
      The beach which lay before him, high and dry:
    The greatest danger here was from a shark,
      That carried off his neighbour by the thigh;
    As for the other two, they could not swim,
    So nobody arrived on shore but him.

                      CVII.

    Nor yet had he arrived but for the oar,
      Which, providentially for him, was washed
    Just as his feeble arms could strike no more,
      And the hard wave o'erwhelmed him as 't was dashed
    Within his grasp; he clung to it, and sore
      The waters beat while he thereto was lashed;
    At last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he
    Rolled on the beach, half-senseless, from the sea:

                      CVIII.

    There, breathless, with his digging nails he clung
      Fast to the sand, lest the returning wave,
    From whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,
      Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:
    And there he lay, full length, where he was flung,
      Before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,
    With just enough of life to feel its pain,
    And deem that it was saved, perhaps, in vain.

                      CIX.

    With slow and staggering effort he arose,
      But sunk again upon his bleeding knee
    And quivering hand; and then he looked for those
      Who long had been his mates upon the sea;
    But none of them appeared to share his woes,
      Save one, a corpse, from out the famished three,
    Who died two days before, and now had found
    An unknown barren beach for burial ground.

                      CX.

    And as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,
      And down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand
    Swam round and round, and all his senses passed:
      He fell upon his side, and his stretched hand
    Drooped dripping on the oar (their jury-mast),
      And, like a withered lily, on the land
    His slender frame and pallid aspect lay,
    As fair a thing as e'er was formed of clay.

                      CXI.

    How long in his damp trance young Juan lay[147]
      He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,
    And Time had nothing more of night nor day
      For his congealing blood, and senses dim;
    And how this heavy faintness passed away
      He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,
    And tingling vein, seemed throbbing back to life,
    For Death, though vanquished, still retired with strife.

                      CXII.

    His eyes he opened, shut, again unclosed,
      For all was doubt and dizziness; he thought
    He still was in the boat, and had but dozed,
      And felt again with his despair o'erwrought,
    And wished it Death in which he had reposed,
      And then once more his feelings back were brought,
    And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen
    A lovely female face of seventeen.

                      CXIII.

    'T was bending close o'er his, and the small mouth
      Seemed almost prying into his for breath;
    And chafing him, the soft warm hand of youth
      Recalled his answering spirits back from Death:
    And, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe
      Each pulse to animation, till beneath
    Its gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh
    To these kind efforts made a low reply.

                      CXIV.

    Then was the cordial poured, and mantle flung
      Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm
    Raised higher the faint head which o'er it hung;
      And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,
    Pillowed his death-like forehead; then she wrung
      His dewy curls, long drenched by every storm;
    And watched with eagerness each throb that drew
    A sigh from his heaved bosom--and hers, too.

                      CXV.

    And lifting him with care into the cave,
      The gentle girl, and her attendant,--one
    Young, yet her elder, and of brow less grave,
      And more robust of figure,--then begun
    To kindle fire, and as the new flames gave
      Light to the rocks that roofed them, which the sun
    Had never seen, the maid, or whatsoe'er
    She was, appeared distinct, and tall, and fair.

                      CXVI.

    Her brow was overhung with coins of gold,
      That sparkled o'er the auburn of her hair--
    Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were rolled
      In braids behind; and though her stature were
    Even of the highest for a female mould,
      They nearly reached her heel; and in her air
    There was a something which bespoke command,
    As one who was a Lady in the land.

                      CXVII.

    Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes
      Were black as Death, their lashes the same hue,
    Of downcast length, in whose silk shadow lies
      Deepest attraction; for when to the view
    Forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,
      Ne'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;
    'T is as the snake late coiled, who pours his length,
    And hurls at once his venom and his strength.

                      CXVIII.

    Her brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye
      Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;
    Short upper lip--sweet lips! that make us sigh
      Ever to have seen such; for she was one[bh]
    Fit for the model of a statuary
      (A race of mere impostors, when all's done--
    I've seen much finer women, ripe and real,
    Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal).[bi][148]

                      CXIX.

    I'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just
      One should not rail without a decent cause:
    There was an Irish lady,[149] to whose bust
      I ne'er saw justice done, and yet she was
    A frequent model; and if e'er she must
      Yield to stern Time and Nature's wrinkling laws,
    They will destroy a face which mortal thought
    Ne'er compassed, nor less mortal chisel wrought.

                      CXX.

    And such was she, the lady of the cave:
      Her dress was very different from the Spanish,
    Simpler, and yet of colours not so grave;
      For, as you know, the Spanish women banish
    Bright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave
      Around them (what I hope will never vanish)
    The basquiña and the mantilla, they
    Seem at the same time mystical and gay.[150]

                      CXXI.

    But with our damsel this was not the case:
      Her dress was many-coloured, finely spun;
    Her locks curled negligently round her face,
      But through them gold and gems profusely shone:
    Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace
      Flowed in her veil, and many a precious stone
    Flashed on her little hand; but, what was shocking,
    Her small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.

                      CXXII.

    The other female's dress was not unlike,
      But of inferior materials: she
    Had not so many ornaments to strike,
      Her hair had silver only, bound to be
    Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,
      Was coarser; and her air, though firm, less free;
    Her hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes
    As black, but quicker, and of smaller size.

                      CXXIII.

    And these two tended him, and cheered him both
      With food and raiment, and those soft attentions,
    Which are--as I must own--of female growth,
      And have ten thousand delicate inventions:
    They made a most superior mess of broth,
      A thing which poesy but seldom mentions,
    But the best dish that e'er was cooked since Homer's
    Achilles ordered dinner for new comers.[151]

                      CXXIV.

    I'll tell you who they were, this female pair,
      Lest they should seem Princesses in disguise;
    Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air
      Of clap-trap, which your recent poets prize;
    And so, in short, the girls they really were
      They shall appear before your curious eyes,
    Mistress and maid; the first was only daughter
    Of an old man, who lived upon the water.

                      CXXV.

    A fisherman he had been in his youth,
      And still a sort of fisherman was he;
    But other speculations were, in sooth,
      Added to his connection with the sea,
    Perhaps not so respectable, in truth:
      A little smuggling, and some piracy,
    Left him, at last, the sole of many masters
    Of an ill-gotten million of piastres.

                      CXXVI.

    A fisher, therefore, was he,--though of men,
      Like Peter the Apostle, and he fished
    For wandering merchant-vessels, now and then,
      And sometimes caught as many as he wished;
    The cargoes he confiscated, and gain
      He sought in the slave-market too, and dished
    Full many a morsel for that Turkish trade,
    By which, no doubt, a good deal may be made.

                      CXXVII.

    He was a Greek, and on his isle had built
      (One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)
    A very handsome house from out his guilt,
      And there he lived exceedingly at ease;
    Heaven knows what cash he got, or blood he spilt,
      A sad old fellow was he, if you please;
    But this I know, it was a spacious building,
    Full of barbaric carving, paint, and gilding.

                      CXXVIII.

    He had an only daughter, called Haidée,
      The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;
    Besides, so very beautiful was she,
      Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:
    Still in her teens, and like a lovely tree
      She grew to womanhood, and between whiles
    Rejected several suitors, just to learn
    How to accept a better in his turn.

                      CXXIX.

    And walking out upon the beach, below
      The cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,
    Insensible,--not dead, but nearly so,--
      Don Juan, almost famished, and half drowned;
    But being naked, she was shocked, you know,
      Yet deemed herself in common pity bound,
    As far as in her lay, "to take him in,
    A stranger" dying--with so white a skin.

                      CXXX.

    But taking him into her father's house
      Was not exactly the best way to save,
    But like conveying to the cat the mouse,
      Or people in a trance into their grave;
    Because the good old man had so much "νους"[Greek: "nous"],
      Unlike the honest Arab thieves so brave,
    He would have hospitably cured the stranger,
    And sold him instantly when out of danger.

                      CXXXI.

    And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best
      (A virgin always on her maid relies)
    To place him in the cave for present rest:
      And when, at last, he opened his black eyes,
    Their charity increased about their guest;
      And their compassion grew to such a size,
