    It opened half the turnpike-gates to Heaven--
    (St. Paul says, 't is the toll which must be given).

                      CXXXII.

    They made a fire,--but such a fire as they
      Upon the moment could contrive with such
    Materials as were cast up round the bay,--
      Some broken planks, and oars, that to the touch
    Were nearly tinder, since, so long they lay,
      A mast was almost crumbled to a crutch;
    But, by God's grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,
    That there was fuel to have furnished twenty.

                      CXXXIII.

    He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,[bj]
      For Haidée stripped her sables off to make
    His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,
      And warm, in case by chance he should awake,
    They also gave a petticoat apiece,
      She and her maid,--and promised by daybreak
    To pay him a fresh visit, with a dish
    For breakfast, of eggs, coffee, bread, and fish.

                      CXXXIV.

    And thus they left him to his lone repose:
      Juan slept like a top, or like the dead,
    Who sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows),
      Just for the present; and in his lulled head
    Not even a vision of his former woes
      Throbbed in accurséd dreams, which sometimes spread[bk]
    Unwelcome visions of our former years,
    Till the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears.

                      CXXXV.

    Young Juan slept all dreamless:--but the maid,
      Who smoothed his pillow, as she left the den
    Looked back upon him, and a moment stayed,
      And turned, believing that he called again.
    He slumbered; yet she thought, at least she said
      (The heart will slip, even as the tongue and pen),
    He had pronounced her name--but she forgot
    That at this moment Juan knew it not.

                      CXXXVI.

    And pensive to her father's house she went,
      Enjoining silence strict to Zoe, who
    Better than her knew what, in fact, she meant,
      She being wiser by a year or two:
    A year or two's an age when rightly spent,
      And Zoe spent hers, as most women do,
    In gaining all that useful sort of knowledge
    Which is acquired in Nature's good old college.

                      CXXXVII.

    The morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still
      Fast in his cave, and nothing clashed upon
    His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,
      And the young beams of the excluded Sun,
    Troubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;
      And need he had of slumber yet, for none
    Had suffered more--his hardships were comparative[bl]
    To those related in my grand-dad's "Narrative."[152]

                      CXXXVIII.

    Not so Haidée: she sadly tossed and tumbled,
      And started from her sleep, and, turning o'er,
    Dreamed of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,
      And handsome corpses strewed upon the shore;
    And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,
      And called her father's old slaves up, who swore
    In several oaths--Armenian, Turk, and Greek--
    They knew not what to think of such a freak.

                      CXXXIX.

    But up she got, and up she made them get,
      With some pretence about the Sun, that makes
    Sweet skies just when he rises, or is set;
      And 't is, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks
    Bright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet
      With mist, and every bird with him awakes,
    And night is flung off like a mourning suit
    Worn for a husband,--or some other brute.[bm]

                      CXL.

    I say, the Sun is a most glorious sight,
      I've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late
    I have sat up on purpose all the night,[bn][153]
      Which hastens, as physicians say, one's fate;
    And so all ye, who would be in the right
      In health and purse, begin your day to date
    From daybreak, and when coffined at fourscore,
    Engrave upon the plate, you rose at four.

                      CXLI.

    And Haidée met the morning face to face;
      Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush
    Had dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race
      From heart to cheek is curbed into a blush,
    Like to a torrent which a mountain's base,
      That overpowers some Alpine river's rush,
    Checks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;
    Or the Red Sea--but the sea is not red.[154]

                      CXLII.

    And down the cliff the island virgin came,
      And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,
    While the Sun smiled on her with his first flame,
      And young Aurora kissed her lips with dew,
    Taking her for a sister; just the same
      Mistake you would have made on seeing the two,
    Although the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,
    Had all the advantage, too, of not being air.[bo]

                      CXLIII.

    And when into the cavern Haidée stepped
      All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw
    That like an infant Juan sweetly slept;
      And then she stopped, and stood as if in awe
    (For sleep is awful), and on tiptoe crept
      And wrapped him closer, lest the air, too raw,
    Should reach his blood, then o'er him still as Death
    Bent, with hushed lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath.

                      CXLIV.

    And thus like to an Angel o'er the dying
      Who die in righteousness, she leaned; and there
    All tranquilly the shipwrecked boy was lying,
      As o'er him lay the calm and stirless air:
    But Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,
      Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair
    Must breakfast--and, betimes, lest they should ask it,
    She drew out her provision from the basket.

                      CXLV.

    She knew that the best feelings must have victual,
      And that a shipwrecked youth would hungry be;
    Besides, being less in love, she yawned a little,
      And felt her veins chilled by the neighbouring sea;
    And so, she cooked their breakfast to a tittle;
      I can't say that she gave them any tea,
    But there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,
    With Scio wine,--and all for love, not money.

                      CXLVI.

    And Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and
      The coffee made, would fain have wakened Juan;
    But Haidée stopped her with her quick small hand,
      And without word, a sign her finger drew on
    Her lip, which Zoe needs must understand;
      And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,
    Because her mistress would not let her break
    That sleep which seemed as it would ne'er awake.

                      CXLVII.

    For still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek
      A purple hectic played like dying day
    On the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak
      Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,
    Where the blue veins looked shadowy, shrunk, and weak;
      And his black curls were dewy with the spray,
    Which weighed upon them yet, all damp and salt,
    Mixed with the stony vapours of the vault.

                      CXLVIII.

    And she bent o'er him, and he lay beneath,
      Hushed as the babe upon its mother's breast,
    Drooped as the willow when no winds can breathe,
      Lulled like the depth of Ocean when at rest,
    Fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath,
      Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest;[bp]
    In short, he was a very pretty fellow,
    Although his woes had turned him rather yellow.

                      CXLIX.

    He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,
      But the fair face which met his eyes forbade
    Those eyes to close, though weariness and pain
      Had further sleep a further pleasure made:
    For Woman's face was never formed in vain
      For Juan, so that even when he prayed
    He turned from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,
    To the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary.

                      CL.

    And thus upon his elbow he arose,
      And looked upon the lady, in whose cheek
    The pale contended with the purple rose,
      As with an effort she began to speak;
    Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,
      Although she told him, in good modern Greek,
    With an Ionian accent, low and sweet,
    That he was faint, and must not talk, but eat.

                      CLI.

    Now Juan could not understand a word,
      Being no Grecian; but he had an ear,
    And her voice was the warble of a bird,[155]
      So soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,
    That finer, simpler music ne'er was heard;[bq]
      The sort of sound we echo with a tear,
    Without knowing why--an overpowering tone,
    Whence Melody descends as from a throne.

                      CLII.

    And Juan gazed as one who is awoke
      By a distant organ, doubting if he be
    Not yet a dreamer, till the spell is broke
      By the watchman, or some such reality,
    Or by one's early valet's curséd knock;
      At least it is a heavy sound to me,
    Who like a morning slumber--for the night
    Shows stars and women in a better light.

                      CLIII.

    And Juan, too, was helped out from his dream,
      Or sleep, or whatsoe'er it was, by feeling
    A most prodigious appetite; the steam
      Of Zoe's cookery no doubt was stealing
    Upon his senses, and the kindling beam
      Of the new fire, which Zoe kept up, kneeling,
    To stir her viands, made him quite awake
    And long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak.

                      CLIV.

    But beef is rare within these oxless isles;
      Goat's flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton,
    And, when a holiday upon them smiles,
      A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:
    But this occurs but seldom, between whiles,
      For some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on;
    Others are fair and fertile, among which
    This, though not large, was one of the most rich.

                      CLV.

    I say that beef is rare, and can't help thinking
      That the old fable of the Minotaur--From
    which our modern morals, rightly shrinking,
      Condemn the royal lady's taste who wore
    A cow's shape for a mask--was only (sinking
      The allegory) a mere type, no more,
    That Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,
    To make the Cretans bloodier in battle.

                      CLVI.

    For we all know that English people are
      Fed upon beef--I won't say much of beer,
    Because 't is liquor only, and being far
      From this my subject, has no business here;
    We know, too, they are very fond of war,
      A pleasure--like all pleasures--rather dear;
    So were the Cretans--from which I infer,
    That beef and battles both were owing to her.

                      CLVII.

    But to resume. The languid Juan raised
      His head upon his elbow, and he saw
    A sight on which he had not lately gazed,
      As all his latter meals had been quite raw,
    Three or four things, for which the Lord he praised,
      And, feeling still the famished vulture gnaw,
    He fell upon whate'er was offered, like
    A priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike.

                      CLVIII.

    He ate, and he was well supplied; and she,
      Who watched him like a mother, would have fed
    Him past all bounds, because she smiled to see
      Such appetite in one she had deemed dead:
    But Zoe, being older than Haidée,
      Knew (by tradition, for she ne'er had read)
    That famished people must be slowly nurst,
    And fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst.

                      CLIX.

    And so she took the liberty to state,
      Rather by deeds than words, because the case
    Was urgent, that the gentleman, whose fate
      Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace
    The sea-shore at this hour, must leave his plate,
      Unless he wished to die upon the place--
    She snatched it, and refused another morsel,
    Saying, he had gorged enough to make a horse ill.

                      CLX.

    Next they--he being naked, save a tattered
      Pair of scarce decent trowsers--went to work,
    And in the fire his recent rags they scattered,
      And dressed him, for the present, like a Turk,
    Or Greek--that is, although it not much mattered,
      Omitting turban, slippers, pistol, dirk,--
    They furnished him, entire, except some stitches,
    With a clean shirt, and very spacious breeches.

                      CLXI.

    And then fair Haidée tried her tongue at speaking,
      But not a word could Juan comprehend,
    Although he listened so that the young Greek in
      Her earnestness would ne'er have made an end;
    And, as he interrupted not, went eking
      Her speech out to her protégé and friend,
    Till pausing at the last her breath to take,
    She saw he did not understand Romaic.

                      CLXII.

    And then she had recourse to nods, and signs,
      And smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,
    And read (the only book she could) the lines
      Of his fair face, and found, by sympathy,
    The answer eloquent, where the Soul shines
      And darts in one quick glance a long reply;
    And thus in every look she saw expressed
    A world of words, and things at which she guessed.

                      CLXIII.

    And now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,
      And words repeated after her, he took
    A lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,
      No doubt, less of her language than her look:
    As he who studies fervently the skies
      Turns oftener to the stars than to his book,
    Thus Juan learned his _alpha beta_ better
    From Haidée's glance than any graven letter.

                      CLXIV.

    'T is pleasing to be schooled in a strange tongue
      By female lips and eyes--that is, I mean,
    When both the teacher and the taught are young,
      As was the case, at least, where I have been;[156]
    They smile so when one's right, and when one's wrong
      They smile still more, and then there intervene
    Pressure of hands, perhaps even a chaste kiss;--[br]
    I learned the little that I know by this:

                      CLXV.

    That is, some words of Spanish, Turk, and Greek,
      Italian not at all, having no teachers;[bs]
    Much English I cannot pretend to speak,
      Learning that language chiefly from its preachers,
    Barrow, South, Tillotson, whom every week
      I study, also Blair--the highest reachers
    Of eloquence in piety and prose--
    I hate your poets, so read none of those.

                      CLXVI.

    As for the ladies, I have nought to say,
      A wanderer from the British world of Fashion,[157]
    Where I, like other "dogs, have had my day,"
      Like other men, too, may have had my passion--
    But that, like other things, has passed away,
      And all her fools whom I _could_ lay the lash on:
    Foes, friends, men, women, now are nought to me
    But dreams of what has been, no more to be.[bt]

                      CLXVII.

    Return we to Don Juan. He begun[158]
      To hear new words, and to repeat them; but
    Some feelings, universal as the Sun,
      Were such as could not in his breast be shut
    More than within the bosom of a nun:
      He was in love,--as you would be, no doubt,
    With a young benefactress,--so was she,
    Just in the way we very often see.

                      CLXVIII.

    And every day by daybreak--rather early
      For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest--
    She came into the cave, but it was merely
      To see her bird reposing in his nest;[159]
    And she would softly stir his locks so curly,
      Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,
    Breathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,[bu]
    As o'er a bed of roses the sweet South.

                      CLXIX.

    And every morn his colour freshlier came,
      And every day helped on his convalescence;
    'T was well, because health in the human frame
      Is pleasant, besides being true Love's essence,
    For health and idleness to Passion's flame
      Are oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons
    Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,
    Without whom Venus will not long attack us.[160]

                      CLXX.

    While Venus fills the heart, (without heart really
      Love, though good always, is not quite so good,)
    Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli,--
      For Love must be sustained like flesh and blood,--While
    Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly:
      Eggs, oysters, too, are amatory food;[bv]
    But who is their purveyor from above
    Heaven knows,--it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.

                      CLXXI.

    When Juan woke he found some good things ready,
      A bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes
    That ever made a youthful heart less steady,
      Besides her maid's, as pretty for their size;
    But I have spoken of all this already--
      A repetition's tiresome and unwise,--
    Well--Juan, after bathing in the sea,
    Came always back to coffee and Haidée.

                      CLXXII.

    Both were so young, and one so innocent,
      That bathing passed for nothing; Juan seemed
    To her, as 't were, the kind of being sent,
      Of whom these two years she had nightly dreamed,
    A something to be loved, a creature meant
      To be her happiness, and whom she deemed
    To render happy; all who joy would win
    Must share it,--Happiness was born a Twin.

                      CLXXIII.

    It was such pleasure to behold him, such
      Enlargement of existence to partake
    Nature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,
      To watch him slumbering, and to see him wake:
    To live with him for ever were too much;
      But then the thought of parting made her quake;
    He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast
    Like a rich wreck--her first love, and her last.[bw]

                      CLXXIV.

    And thus a moon rolled on, and fair Haidée
      Paid daily visits to her boy, and took
    Such plentiful precautions, that still he
      Remained unknown within his craggy nook;
    At last her father's prows put out to sea,
      For certain merchantmen upon the look,
    Not as of yore to carry off an Io,
    But three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio.

                      CLXXV.

    Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,
      So that, her father being at sea, she was
    Free as a married woman, or such other
      Female, as where she likes may freely pass,
    Without even the encumbrance of a brother,
      The freest she that ever gazed on glass:
    I speak of Christian lands in this comparison,
    Where wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison.

                      CLXXVI.

    Now she prolonged her visits and her talk
      (For they must talk), and he had learnt to say
    So much as to propose to take a walk,--
      For little had he wandered since the day
    On which, like a young flower snapped from the stalk,
      Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,--
    And thus they walked out in the afternoon,
    And saw the sun set opposite the moon.[bx]

                      CLXXVII.

    It was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,
      With cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,
    Guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,
      With here and there a creek, whose aspect wore
    A better welcome to the tempest-tost;
      And rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,
    Save on the dead long summer days, which make
    The outstretched Ocean glitter like a lake.

                      CLXXVIII.

    And the small ripple spilt upon the beach
      Scarcely o'erpassed the cream of your champagne,
    When o'er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,
      That spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!
    Few things surpass old wine; and they may preach
      Who please,--the more because they preach in vain,--
    Let us have Wine and Woman,[161] Mirth and Laughter,
    Sermons and soda-water the day after.

                      CLXXIX.

    Man, being reasonable, must get drunk;
      The best of Life is but intoxication:
    Glory, the Grape, Love, Gold, in these are sunk
      The hopes of all men, and of every nation;
    Without their sap, how branchless were the trunk
      Of Life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion!
    But to return,--Get very drunk, and when
    You wake with headache--you shall see what then!

                      CLXXX.

    Ring for your valet--bid him quickly bring
      Some hock and soda-water,[162] then you'll know
    A pleasure worthy Xerxes the great king;
      For not the blest sherbet, sublimed with snow,[163]
    Nor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,
      Nor Burgundy in all its sunset glow,[by]
    After long travel, Ennui, Love, or Slaughter,
    Vie with that draught of hock and soda-water!

                      CLXXXI.

    The coast--I think it was the coast that I
      Was just describing--Yes, it _was_ the coast--
    Lay at this period quiet as the sky,
      The sands untumbled, the blue waves untossed,
    And all was stillness, save the sea-bird's cry,
      And dolphin's leap, and little billow crossed
    By some low rock or shelve, that made it fret
    Against the boundary it scarcely wet.

                      CLXXXII.

    And forth they wandered, her sire being gone,
      As I have said, upon an expedition;
    And mother, brother, guardian, she had none,
      Save Zoe, who, although with due precision
    She waited on her lady with the Sun,
      Thought daily service was her only mission,
    Bringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,
    And asking now and then for cast-off dresses.

                      CLXXXIII.

    It was the cooling hour, just when the rounded
      Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,
    Which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,
      Circling all Nature, hushed, and dim, and still,
    With the far mountain-crescent half surrounded
      On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill
    Upon the other, and the rosy sky
    With one star sparkling through it like an eye.

                      CLXXXIV.

    And thus they wandered forth, and hand in hand,
      Over the shining pebbles and the shells,
    Glided along the smooth and hardened sand,
      And in the worn and wild receptacles
    Worked by the storms, yet worked as it were planned
      In hollow halls, with sparry roofs and cells,
    They turned to rest; and, each clasped by an arm,
    Yielded to the deep Twilight's purple charm.

                      CLXXXV.

    They looked up to the sky, whose floating glow
      Spread like a rosy Ocean, vast and bright;[bz]
    They gazed upon the glittering sea below,
      Whence the broad Moon rose circling into sight;
    They heard the waves' splash, and the wind so low,
      And saw each other's dark eyes darting light
    Into each other--and, beholding this,
    Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;

                      CLXXXVI.

    A long, long kiss, a kiss of Youth, and Love,
      And Beauty, all concentrating like rays
    Into one focus, kindled from above;
      Such kisses as belong to early days,
    Where Heart, and Soul, and Sense, in concert move,
      And the blood's lava, and the pulse a blaze,
    Each kiss a heart-quake,--for a kiss's strength,
    I think, it must be reckoned by its length.

                      CLXXXVII.

    By length I mean duration; theirs endured
      Heaven knows how long--no doubt they never reckoned;
    And if they had, they could not have secured
      The sum of their sensations to a second:
    They had not spoken, but they felt allured,
      As if their souls and lips each other beckoned,
    Which, being joined, like swarming bees they clung--
    Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.[ca]

                      CLXXXVIII.

    They were alone, but not alone as they
      Who shut in chambers think it loneliness;
    The silent Ocean, and the starlight bay,
      The twilight glow, which momently grew less,
    The voiceless sands, and dropping caves, that lay
      Around them, made them to each other press,
    As if there were no life beneath the sky
    Save theirs, and that their life could never die.

                      CLXXXIX.

    They feared no eyes nor ears on that lone beach;
      They felt no terrors from the night; they were
    All in all to each other: though their speech
      Was broken words, they _thought_ a language there,--
    And all the burning tongues the Passions teach[cb]
      Found in one sigh the best interpreter
    Of Nature's oracle--first love,--that all
    Which Eve has left her daughters since her fall.

                      CXC.

    Haidée spoke not of scruples, asked no vows,
      Nor offered any; she had never heard
    Of plight and promises to be a spouse,
      Or perils by a loving maid incurred;
    She was all which pure Ignorance allows,
      And flew to her young mate like a young bird;
    And, never having dreamt of falsehood, she
    Had not one word to say of constancy.

                      CXCI.

    She loved, and was belovéd--she adored,
      And she was worshipped after Nature's fashion--
    Their intense souls, into each other poured,
      If souls could die, had perished in that passion,--
    But by degrees their senses were restored,
      Again to be o'ercome, again to dash on;
    And, beating 'gainst _his_ bosom, Haidée's heart
    Felt as if never more to beat apart.

                      CXCII.

    Alas! they were so young, so beautiful,
      So lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour
    Was that in which the Heart is always full,
      And, having o'er itself no further power,
    Prompts deeds Eternity can not annul,
      But pays off moments in an endless shower
    Of hell-fire--all prepared for people giving
    Pleasure or pain to one another living.

                      CXCIII.

    Alas! for Juan and Haidée! they were
      So loving and so lovely--till then never,
    Excepting our first parents, such a pair
      Had run the risk of being damned for ever:
    And Haidée, being devout as well as fair,
      Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,
    And Hell and Purgatory--but forgot
    Just in the very crisis she should not.

                      CXCIV.

    They look upon each other, and their eyes
      Gleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps
    Round Juan's head, and his around her lies
      Half buried in the tresses which it grasps;
    She sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,
      He hers, until they end in broken gasps;
    And thus they form a group that's quite antique,
    Half naked, loving, natural, and Greek.

                      CXCV.

    And when those deep and burning moments passed,
      And Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,
    She slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,
      Sustained his head upon her bosom's charms;
    And now and then her eye to Heaven is cast,
      And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,
    Pillowed on her o'erflowing heart, which pants
    With all it granted, and with all it grants.[cc]

                      CXCVI.

    An infant when it gazes on a light,
      A child the moment when it drains the breast,
    A devotee when soars the Host in sight,
      An Arab with a stranger for a guest,
    A sailor when the prize has struck in fight,
      A miser filling his most hoarded chest,
    Feel rapture; but not such true joy are reaping
    As they who watch o'er what they love while sleeping.

                      CXCVII.

    For there it lies so tranquil, so beloved,
      All that it hath of Life with us is living;
    So gentle, stirless, helpless, and unmoved,
      And all unconscious of the joy 't is giving;
    All it hath felt, inflicted, passed, and proved,
      Hushed into depths beyond the watcher's diving:
    There lies the thing we love with all its errors
    And all its charms, like Death without its terrors.

                      CXCVIII.

    The Lady watched her lover--and that hour
      Of Love's, and Night's, and Ocean's solitude
    O'erflowed her soul with their united power;
      Amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude
    She and her wave-worn love had made their bower,
      Where nought upon their passion could intrude,
    And all the stars that crowded the blue space
    Saw nothing happier than her glowing face.

                      CXCIX.

    Alas! the love of Women! it is known
      To be a lovely and a fearful thing;
    For all of theirs upon that die is thrown,
      And if 't is lost, Life hath no more to bring
    To them but mockeries of the past alone,
      And their revenge is as the tiger's spring,
    Deadly, and quick, and crushing; yet, as real
    Torture is theirs--what they inflict they feel.

                      CC.

    They are right; for Man, to man so oft unjust,
      Is always so to Women: one sole bond
    Awaits them--treachery is all their trust;
      Taught to conceal their bursting hearts despond
    Over their idol, till some wealthier lust
      Buys them in marriage--and what rests beyond?
    A thankless husband--next, a faithless lover--
    Then dressing, nursing, praying--and all's over.

                      CCI.

    Some take a lover, some take drams or prayers,
      Some mind their household, others dissipation,
    Some run away, and but exchange their cares,
      Losing the advantage of a virtuous station;
    Few changes e'er can better their affairs,
      Theirs being an unnatural situation,
    From the dull palace to the dirty hovel:[cd]
    Some play the devil, and then write a novel.[164]

                      CCII.

    Haidée was Nature's bride, and knew not this;
      Haidée was Passion's child, born where the Sun
    Showers triple light, and scorches even the kiss
      Of his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one
    Made but to love, to feel that she was his
      Who was her chosen: what was said or done
    Elsewhere was nothing. She had nought to fear,
    Hope, care, nor love, beyond,--her heart beat _here_.

                      CCIII.

    And oh! that quickening of the heart, that beat!
      How much it costs us! yet each rising throb
    Is in its cause as its effect so sweet,
      That Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob
    Joy of its alchemy, and to repeat
      Fine truths; even Conscience, too, has a tough job
    To make us understand each good old maxim,
    So good--I wonder Castlereagh don't tax 'em.

                      CCIV.

    And now 't was done--on the lone shore were plighted
      Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed
    Beauty upon the beautiful they lighted:
      Ocean their witness, and the cave their bed,
    By their own feelings hallowed and united,
      Their priest was Solitude, and they were wed:[ce]
    And they were happy--for to their young eyes
    Each was an angel, and earth Paradise.

                      CCV.

    Oh, Love! of whom great Cæsar was the suitor,
      Titus the master,[165] Antony the slave,
    Horace, Catullus, scholars--Ovid tutor--
      Sappho the sage blue-stocking, in whose grave
    All those may leap who rather would be neuter--
      (Leucadia's rock still overlooks the wave)--
    Oh, Love! thou art the very God of evil,
    For, after all, we cannot call thee Devil.

                      CCVI.

    Thou mak'st the chaste connubial state precarious,
      And jestest with the brows of mightiest men:
    Cæsar and Pompey, Mahomet, Belisarius,[166]
      Have much employed the Muse of History's pen:
    Their lives and fortunes were extremely various,
      Such worthies Time will never see again;
    Yet to these four in three things the same luck holds,
    They all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.

                      CCVII.

    Thou mak'st philosophers; there's Epicurus
      And Aristippus, a material crew!
    Who to immoral courses would allure us
      By theories quite practicable too;
    If only from the Devil they would insure us,
      How pleasant were the maxim (not quite new),
    "Eat, drink, and love, what can the rest avail us?"
    So said the royal sage Sardanapalus.[167]

                      CCVIII.

    But Juan! had he quite forgotten Julia?
      And should he have forgotten her so soon?
    I can't but say it seems to me most truly a
      Perplexing question; but, no doubt, the moon
    Does these things for us, and whenever newly a
      Strong palpitation rises, 't is her boon,
    Else how the devil is it that fresh features
    Have such a charm for us poor human creatures?

                      CCIX.

    I hate inconstancy--I loathe, detest,
      Abhor, condemn, abjure the mortal made
    Of such quicksilver clay that in his breast
      No permanent foundation can be laid;
    Love, constant love, has been my constant guest,
      And yet last night, being at a masquerade,
    I saw the prettiest creature, fresh from Milan,
    Which gave me some sensations like a villain.

                      CCX.

    But soon Philosophy came to my aid,
      And whispered, "Think of every sacred tie!"
    "I will, my dear Philosophy!" I said,
      "But then her teeth, and then, oh, Heaven! her eye!
    I'll just inquire if she be wife or maid,
      Or neither--out of curiosity."
    "Stop!" cried Philosophy, with air so Grecian,
    (Though she was masqued then as a fair Venetian;)

                      CCXI.

    "Stop!" so I stopped.--But to return: that which
      Men call inconstancy is nothing more
    Than admiration due where Nature's rich
      Profusion with young beauty covers o'er
    Some favoured object; and as in the niche
      A lovely statue we almost adore,
    This sort of adoration of the real
    Is but a heightening of the _beau ideal_.

                      CCXII.

    'T is the perception of the Beautiful,
      A fine extension of the faculties,
    Platonic, universal, wonderful,
      Drawn from the stars, and filtered through the skies,
    Without which Life would be extremely dull;
      In short, it is the use of our own eyes,
    With one or two small senses added, just
    To hint that flesh is formed of fiery dust.[cf]

                      CCXIII.

    Yet 't is a painful feeling, and unwilling,
      For surely if we always could perceive
    In the same object graces quite as killing
      As when she rose upon us like an Eve,
    'T would save us many a heartache, many a shilling,
      (For we must get them anyhow, or grieve),
    Whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,
    How pleasant for the heart, as well as liver!

                      CCXIV.

    The Heart is like the sky, a part of Heaven,
      But changes night and day, too, like the sky;
    Now o'er it clouds and thunder must be driven,
      And Darkness and Destruction as on high:
    But when it hath been scorched, and pierced, and riven,
      Its storms expire in water-drops; the eye
    Pours forth at last the Heart's blood turned to tears,
    Which make the English climate of our years.

                      CCXV.

    The liver is the lazaret of bile,
      But very rarely executes its function,
    For the first passion stays there such a while,
      That all the rest creep in and form a junction,
    Like knots of vipers on a dunghill's soil--[168]
      Rage, fear, hate, jealousy, revenge, compunction--
    So that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,
    Like Earthquakes from the hidden fire called "central."

                      CCXVI.

    In the mean time, without proceeding more
      In this anatomy, I've finished now
    Two hundred and odd stanzas as before,[cg]
      That being about the number I'll allow
    Each canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;
      And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,
    Leaving Don Juan and Haidée to plead
    For them and theirs with all who deign to read.

[102] ["Night came on worse than the day had been; and a _sudden shift
of wind,_ about midnight, _threw the ship into the trough of the sea,
which struck her aft, tore away the rudder, started the stern-post, and
shattered the whole of her stern-frame. The pumps_ were _immediately
sounded,_ and in the course of a few minutes the water had increased to
_four feet_....

_"One gang was instantly put on them, and the remainder of the people
employed in getting up_ rice from the run of the ship, and heaving it
over, _to come at the leak,_ if possible. After three or four hundred
bags were thrown into the sea, _we did get at it,_ and found _the water
rushing_ into the ship with astonishing rapidity; therefore we _thrust
sheets, shirts, jackets, tales of muslin,_ and everything of the like
description that could be got, _into the opening._

"Notwithstanding the pumps _discharged fifty tons of water an hour,_ the
ship certainly _must have gone down,_ had not our _expedients_ been
attended with some success. _The pumps,_ to the excellent construction
of which I owe the preservation of my life, _were made by Mr. Mann of
London. As the next day advanced, the weather appeared to moderate,_ the
men continued incessantly at the pumps, and every exertion was made to
_keep the ship afloat._"--See "Loss of the American ship _Hercules,_

"The ship _lay motionless_, and, to all appearance, irrevocably
overset.... _The water forsook the hold_, and appeared between decks....

"Immediate directions were given _to cut away the main and mizen masts_,
trusting when the ship righted, to be able to wear her. On cutting one
or two lanyards, the _mizen-mast went first over_, but without producing
the smallest effect on the ship, and, on cutting the lanyard of one
shroud, the _main-mast followed_. I had next the mortification to see
the _foremast and bowsprit also go over_. On this, _the ship immediately
righted with great violence_."--"Loss of the _Centaur_ Man-of-War, 1782,

hence.'--'I know we must die,'_ replied the gallant officer, coolly,
_'but let us die like men!'--Armed with a brace of pistols,_ he kept his
post, even while the ship was sinking."--"Loss of the _Earl of

"_The weather again threatened_, and by noon _it blew a storm_. The ship
laboured greatly; _the water appeared in the fore and after-hold_. I was
informed by the carpenter also that _the leathers_ were nearly consumed,
and the _chains of the pumps_, by constant exertion, and friction of the
coils, were rendered almost useless....

[107] [Stanza xliv. recalls Cardinal de Retz's description of the storm
at sea in the Gulf of Lyons: "Everybody were at their prayers, or were
confessing themselves.... The private captain of the galley caused, in
the greatest height of the danger, _his embroidered coat and his red
scarf_ to be brought to him, saying, that a true Spaniard ought to die
bearing his King's Marks of distinction. He sat himself down in a great
elbow chair, and with his foot struck a poor Neapolitan in the chops,
who, not being able to stand upon the Coursey of the Galley, was

      Or know who rested there, a foe to rest,
    Had soiled the current of her sinless years,
    And turned her pure heart's purest blood to tears!

                      II.

    Oh, Love! what is it in this world of ours
      Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah why
    With cypress branches hast thou wreathed thy bowers,
      And made thy best interpreter a sigh?
    As those who dote on odours pluck the flowers,
      And place them on their breast--but place to die--
    Thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish
    Are laid within our bosoms but to perish.

                      III.

    In her first passion Woman loves her lover,
      In all the others all she loves is Love,
    Which grows a habit she can ne'er get over,
      And fits her loosely--like an easy glove,[ch]
    As you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:
      One man alone at first her heart can move;
    She then prefers him in the plural number,
    Not finding that the additions much encumber.

                      IV.

    I know not if the fault be men's or theirs;
      But one thing's pretty sure; a woman planted
    (Unless at once she plunge for life in prayers)--
      After a decent time must be gallanted;
    Although, no doubt, her first of love affairs
      Is that to which her heart is wholly granted;
    Yet there are some, they say, who have had _none_,
    But those who have ne'er end with only _one_.[170]

                      V.

    'T is melancholy, and a fearful sign
      Of human frailty, folly, also crime,
    That Love and Marriage rarely can combine,
      Although they both are born in the same clime;
    Marriage from Love, like vinegar from wine--
      A sad, sour, sober beverage--by Time
    Is sharpened from its high celestial flavour
    Down to a very homely household savour.

                      VI.

    There's something of antipathy, as 't were,
      Between their present and their future state;
    A kind of flattery that's hardly fair
      Is used until the truth arrives too late--
    Yet what can people do, except despair?
      The same things change their names at such a rate;
    For instance--Passion in a lover's glorious,
    But in a husband is pronounced uxorious.

                      VII.

    Men grow ashamed of being so very fond;
      They sometimes also get a little tired
    (But that, of course, is rare), and then despond:
      The same things cannot always be admired,
    Yet 't is "so nominated in the bond,"[171]
      That both are tied till one shall have expired.
    Sad thought! to lose the spouse that was adorning
    Our days, and put one's servants into mourning.

                      VIII.

    There's doubtless something in domestic doings
      Which forms, in fact, true Love's antithesis;
    Romances paint at full length people's wooings,
      But only give a bust of marriages;
    For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,
      There's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:
    Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,
    He would have written sonnets all his life?[ci]

                      IX.

    All tragedies are finished by a death,
      All comedies are ended by a marriage;
    The future states of both are left to faith,
      For authors fear description might disparage
    The worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,
      And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;
    So leaving each their priest and prayer-book ready,
    They say no more of Death or of the Lady.[172]

                      X.

    The only two that in my recollection,
      Have sung of Heaven and Hell, or marriage, are
    Dante[173] and Milton,[174] and of both the affection
      Was hapless in their nuptials, for some bar
    Of fault or temper ruined the connection
      (Such things, in fact, it don't ask much to mar);
    But Dante's Beatrice and Milton's Eve
    Were not drawn from their spouses, you conceive.

                      XI.

    Some persons say that Dante meant Theology
      By Beatrice, and not a mistress--I,
    Although my opinion may require apology,
      Deem this a commentator's phantasy,
    Unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he
      Decided thus, and showed good reason why;
    I think that Dante's more abstruse ecstatics
    Meant to personify the Mathematics.[175]

                      XII.

    Haidée and Juan were not married, but
      The fault was theirs, not mine: it is not fair,
    Chaste reader, then, in any way to put
      The blame on me, unless you wish they were;
    Then if you'd have them wedded, please to shut
      The book which treats of this erroneous pair,
    Before the consequences grow too awful;
    'T is dangerous to read of loves unlawful.

                      XIII.

    Yet they were happy,--happy in the illicit
      Indulgence of their innocent desires;
    But more imprudent grown with every visit,
      Haidée forgot the island was her Sire's;
    When we have what we like 't is hard to miss it,
      At least in the beginning, ere one tires;
    Thus she came often, not a moment losing,
    Whilst her piratical papa was cruising.

                      XIV.

    Let not his mode of raising cash seem strange,
      Although he fleeced the flags of every nation,
    For into a Prime Minister but change
      His title, and 't is nothing but taxation;
    But he, more modest, took an humbler range
      Of Life, and in an honester vocation
    Pursued o'er the high seas his watery journey,[cj]
    And merely practised as a sea-attorney.

                      XV.

    The good old gentleman had been detained
      By winds and waves, and some important captures;
    And, in the hope of more, at sea remained,
      Although a squall or two had damped his raptures,
    By swamping one of the prizes; he had chained
      His prisoners, dividing them like chapters
    In numbered lots; they all had cuffs and collars,
    And averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars.

                      XVI.

    Some he disposed of off Cape Matapan,
      Among his friends the Mainots; some he sold
    To his Tunis correspondents, save one man
      Tossed overboard unsaleable (being old);
    The rest--save here and there some richer one,
      Reserved for future ransom--in the hold,
    Were linked alike, as, for the common people, he
    Had a large order from the Dey of Tripoli.

                      XVII.

    The merchandise was served in the same way,
      Pieced out for different marts in the Levant,
    Except some certain portions of the prey,
      Light classic articles of female want,
    French stuffs, lace, tweezers, toothpicks, teapot, tray,[ck]
      Guitars and castanets from Alicant,
    All which selected from the spoil he gathers,
    Robbed for his daughter by the best of fathers.

                      XVIII.

    A monkey, a Dutch mastiff, a mackaw,[176]
      Two parrots, with a Persian cat and kittens,
    He chose from several animals he saw--
      A terrier, too, which once had been a Briton's,
    Who dying on the coast of Ithaca,
      The peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance:
    These to secure in this strong blowing weather,
    He caged in one huge hamper altogether.

                      XIX.

    Then, having settled his marine affairs,
      Despatching single cruisers here and there,
    His vessel having need of some repairs,
      He shaped his course to where his daughter fair
    Continued still her hospitable cares;
      But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,
    And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,
    His port lay on the other side o' the isle.

                      XX.

    And there he went ashore without delay,
      Having no custom-house nor quarantine
    To ask him awkward questions on the way,
      About the time and place where he had been:
    He left his ship to be hove down next day,
      With orders to the people to careen;
    So that all hands were busy beyond measure,
    In getting out goods, ballast, guns, and treasure.

                      XXI.

    Arriving at the summit of a hill
      Which overlooked the white walls of his home,
    He stopped.--What singular emotions fill
      Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!
    With fluttering doubts if all be well or ill--
      With love for many, and with fears for some;
    All feelings which o'erleap the years long lost,
    And bring our hearts back to their starting-post.

                      XXII.

    The approach of home to husbands and to sires,
      After long travelling by land or water,
    Most naturally some small doubt inspires--
      A female family's a serious matter,
    (None trusts the sex more, or so much admires--
      But they hate flattery, so I never flatter);
    Wives in their husbands' absences grow subtler,
    And daughters sometimes run off with the butler.

                      XXIII.

    An honest gentleman at his return
      May not have the good fortune of Ulysses;
    Not all lone matrons for their husbands mourn,
      Or show the same dislike to suitors' kisses;
    The odds are that he finds a handsome urn
      To his memory--and two or three young misses
    Born to some friend, who holds his wife and riches--
    And that _his_ Argus[177]--bites him by the breeches.

                      XXIV.

    If single, probably his plighted Fair
      Has in his absence wedded some rich miser;
    But all the better, for the happy pair
      May quarrel, and, the lady growing wiser,
    He may resume his amatory care
      As cavalier servente, or despise her;
    And that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,
    Writes odes on the Inconstancy of Woman.

                      XXV.

    And oh! ye gentlemen who have already
      Some chaste _liaison_ of the kind--I mean
    An honest friendship with a married lady--
      The only thing of this sort ever seen
    To last--of all connections the most steady,
      And the true Hymen, (the first's but a screen)--
    Yet, for all that, keep not too long away--
    I've known the absent wronged four times a day.[cl]

                      XXVI.

    Lambro, our sea-solicitor, who had
      Much less experience of dry land than Ocean,
    On seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;
      But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion
    Of the true reason of his not being sad,
      Or that of any other strong emotion;
    He loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,
    But knew the cause no more than a philosopher.

                      XXVII.

    He saw his white walls shining in the sun,
      His garden trees all shadowy and green;
    He heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,
      The distant dog-bark; and perceived between
    The umbrage of the wood, so cool and dun,
      The moving figures, and the sparkling sheen
    Of arms (in the East all arm)--and various dyes
    Of coloured garbs, as bright as butterflies.

                      XXVIII.

    And as the spot where they appear he nears,
      Surprised at these unwonted signs of idling,
    He hears--alas! no music of the spheres,
      But an unhallowed, earthly sound of fiddling!
    A melody which made him doubt his ears,
      The cause being past his guessing or unriddling;
    A pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after--
    A most unoriental roar of laughter.

                      XXIX.

    And still more nearly to the place advancing,
      Descending rather quickly the declivity,
    Through the waved branches o'er the greensward glancing,
      'Midst other indications of festivity,
    Seeing a troop of his domestics dancing
      Like Dervises, who turn as on a pivot, he
    Perceived it was the Pyrrhic dance[178] so martial,
    To which the Levantines are very partial.

                      XXX.

    And further on a troop of Grecian girls,[179]
      The first and tallest her white kerchief waving,
    Were strung together like a row of pearls,
      Linked hand in hand, and dancing; each too having
    Down her white neck long floating auburn curls--
      (The least of which would set ten poets raving);[cm]
    Their leader sang--and bounded to her song
    With choral step and voice the virgin throng.

                      XXXI.

    And here, assembled cross-legged round their trays,
      Small social parties just begun to dine;
    Pilaus and meats of all sorts met the gaze,
      And flasks of Samian and of Chian wine,
    And sherbet cooling in the porous vase;
      Above them their dessert grew on its vine;--
    The orange and pomegranate nodding o'er,
    Dropped in their laps, scarce plucked, their mellow store.

                      XXXII.

    A band of children, round a snow-white ram,[180]
      There wreathe his venerable horns with flowers;
    While peaceful as if still an unweaned lamb,
      The patriarch of the flock all gently cowers
    His sober head, majestically tame,
      Or eats from out the palm, or playful lowers
    His brow, as if in act to butt, and then
    Yielding to their small hands, draws back again.

                      XXXIII.

    Their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,
      Their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,
    Crimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,
      The gesture which enchants, the eye that speaks,
    The innocence which happy childhood blesses,
      Made quite a picture of these little Greeks;
    So that the philosophical beholder
    Sighed for their sakes--that they should e'er grow older.

                      XXXIV.

    Afar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales
      To a sedate grey circle of old smokers,
    Of secret treasures found in hidden vales,
      Of wonderful replies from Arab jokers,
    Of charms to make good gold and cure bad ails,
      Of rocks bewitched that open to the knockers,
    Of magic ladies who, by one sole act,
    Transformed their lords to beasts (but that's a fact).

                      XXXV.

    Here was no lack of innocent diversion
      For the imagination or the senses,
    Song, dance, wine, music, stories from the Persian,
      All pretty pastimes in which no offence is;
    But Lambro saw all these things with aversion,
      Perceiving in his absence such expenses,
    Dreading that climax of all human ills,
    The inflammation of his weekly bills.

                      XXXVI.

    Ah! what is man? what perils still environ[181]
      The happiest mortals even after dinner!
    A day of gold from out an age of iron
      Is all that Life allows the luckiest sinner;
    Pleasure (whene'er she sings, at least) 's a Siren,
      That lures, to flay alive, the young beginner;
    Lambro's reception at his people's banquet
    Was such as fire accords to a wet blanket.

                      XXXVII.

    He--being a man who seldom used a word
      Too much, and wishing gladly to surprise
    (In general he surprised men with the sword)
      His daughter--had not sent before to advise
    Of his arrival, so that no one stirred;
      And long he paused to re-assure his eyes,
    In fact much more astonished than delighted,
    To find so much good company invited.

                      XXXVIII.

    He did not know (alas! how men will lie)
      That a report (especially the Greeks)
    Avouched his death (such people never die),
      And put his house in mourning several weeks,--
    But now their eyes and also lips were dry;
      The bloom, too, had returned to Haidée's cheeks:
    Her tears, too, being returned into their fount,
    She now kept house upon her own account.

                      XXXIX.

    Hence all this rice, meat, dancing, wine, and fiddling,
      Which turned the isle into a place of pleasure;
    The servants all were getting drunk or idling,
      A life which made them happy beyond measure.
    Her father's hospitality seemed middling,
      Compared with what Haidée did with his treasure;
    'T was wonderful how things went on improving,
    While she had not one hour to spare from loving.[cn]

                      XL.

    Perhaps you think, in stumbling on this feast,
      He flew into a passion, and in fact
    There was no mighty reason to be pleased;
      Perhaps you prophesy some sudden act,
    The whip, the rack, or dungeon at the least,
      To teach his people to be more exact,
    And that, proceeding at a very high rate,
    He showed the royal _penchants_ of a pirate.

                      XLI.

    You're wrong.--He was the mildest mannered man
      That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat;
    With such true breeding of a gentleman,
      You never could divine his real thought;
    No courtier could, and scarcely woman can
      Gird more deceit within a petticoat;
    Pity he loved adventurous life's variety,
    He was so great a loss to good society.

                      XLII.

    Advancing to the nearest dinner tray,
      Tapping the shoulder of the nighest guest,
    With a peculiar smile, which, by the way,
      Boded no good, whatever it expressed,
    He asked the meaning of this holiday;
      The vinous Greek to whom he had addressed
    His question, much too merry to divine
    The questioner, filled up a glass of wine,

                      XLIII.

    And without turning his facetious head,
      Over his shoulder, with a Bacchant air,
    Presented the o'erflowing cup, and said,
      "Talking's dry work, I have no time to spare."
    A second hiccuped, "Our old Master's dead,
      You'd better ask our Mistress who's his heir."
    "Our Mistress!" quoth a third: "Our Mistress!--pooh!--
    You mean our Master--not the old, but new."

                      XLIV.

    These rascals, being new comers, knew not whom
      They thus addressed--and Lambro's visage fell--
    And o'er his eye a momentary gloom
      Passed, but he strove quite courteously to quell
    The expression, and endeavouring to resume
      His smile, requested one of them to tell
    The name and quality of his new patron,
    Who seemed to have turned Haidée into a matron.

                      XLV.

    "I know not," quoth the fellow, "who or what
      He is, nor whence he came--and little care;
    But this I know, that this roast capon's fat,
      And that good wine ne'er washed down better fare;
    And if you are not satisfied with that,
      Direct your questions to my neighbour there;
    He'll answer all for better or for worse,
    For none likes more to hear himself converse."[182]

                      XLVI.

    I said that Lambro was a man of patience,
      And certainly he showed the best of breeding,
    Which scarce even France, the Paragon of nations,
      E'er saw her most polite of sons exceeding;
    He bore these sneers against his near relations,
      His own anxiety, his heart, too, bleeding,
    The insults, too, of every servile glutton,
    Who all the time was eating up his mutton.

                      XLVII.

    Now in a person used to much command--
      To bid men come, and go, and come again--
    To see his orders done, too, out of hand--
      Whether the word was death, or but the chain--
    It may seem strange to find his manners bland;
      Yet such things are, which I cannot explain,
    Though, doubtless, he who can command himself
    Is good to govern--almost as a Guelf.

                      XLVIII.

    Not that he was not sometimes rash or so,
      But never in his real and serious mood;
    Then calm, concentrated, and still, and slow,
      He lay coiled like the Boa in the wood;
    With him it never was a word and blow,
      His angry word once o'er, he shed no blood,
    But in his silence there was much to rue,
    And his _one_ blow left little work for _two_.

                      XLIX.

    He asked no further questions, and proceeded
      On to the house, but by a private way,
    So that the few who met him hardly heeded,
      So little they expected him that day;
    If love paternal in his bosom pleaded
      For Haidée's sake, is more than I can say,
    But certainly to one deemed dead returning,
    This revel seemed a curious mode of mourning.

                      L.

    If all the dead could now return to life,
      (Which God forbid!) or some, or a great many,
    For instance, if a husband or his wife[co]
      (Nuptial examples are as good as any),
    No doubt whate'er might be their former strife,
      The present weather would be much more rainy--
    Tears shed into the grave of the connection
    Would share most probably its resurrection.

                      LI.

    He entered in the house no more his home,
      A thing to human feelings the most trying,
    And harder for the heart to overcome,
      Perhaps, than even the mental pangs of dying;
    To find our hearthstone turned into a tomb,
      And round its once warm precincts palely lying
    The ashes of our hopes, is a deep grief,
    Beyond a _single gentleman's_ belief.

                      LII.

    He entered in the house--his home no more,
      For without hearts there is no home;--and felt
    The solitude of passing his own door
      Without a welcome: _there_ he long had dwelt,
    There his few peaceful days Time had swept o'er,
      There his worn bosom and keen eye would melt
    Over the innocence of that sweet child,
    His only shrine of feelings undefiled.

                      LIII.

    He was a man of a strange temperament,
      Of mild demeanour though of savage mood,
    Moderate in all his habits, and content
      With temperance in pleasure, as in food,
    Quick to perceive, and strong to bear, and meant
      For something better, if not wholly good;
    His Country's wrongs and his despair to save her
    Had stung him from a slave to an enslaver.

                      LIV.

    The love of power, and rapid gain of gold,
      The hardness by long habitude produced,
    The dangerous life in which he had grown old,
      The mercy he had granted oft abused,
    The sights he was accustomed to behold,
      The wild seas, and wild men with whom he cruised,
    Had cost his enemies a long repentance,
    And made him a good friend, but bad acquaintance.

                      LV.

    But something of the spirit of old Greece
      Flashed o'er his soul a few heroic rays,
    Such as lit onward to the Golden Fleece
      His predecessors in the Colchian days;
    'T is true he had no ardent love for peace--
      Alas! his country showed no path to praise:
    Hate to the world and war with every nation
    He waged, in vengeance of her degradation.

                      LVI.

    Still o'er his mind the influence of the clime
      Shed its Ionian elegance, which showed
    Its power unconsciously full many a time,--
      A taste seen in the choice of his abode,
    A love of music and of scenes sublime,
      A pleasure in the gentle stream that flowed
    Past him in crystal, and a joy in flowers,
    Bedewed his spirit in his calmer hours.

                      LVII.

    But whatsoe'er he had of love reposed
      On that belovéd daughter; she had been
    The only thing which kept his heart unclosed
      Amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen,
    A lonely pure affection unopposed:
      There wanted but the loss of this to wean
    His feelings from all milk of human kindness,
    And turn him like the Cyclops mad with blindness.[cp]

                      LVIII.

    The cubless tigress in her jungle raging
      Is dreadful to the shepherd and the flock;
    The Ocean when its yeasty war is waging
      Is awful to the vessel near the rock;
    But violent things will sooner bear assuaging,
      Their fury being spent by its own shock,
    Than the stern, single, deep, and wordless ire[cq]
    Of a strong human heart, and in a Sire.

                      LIX.

    It is a hard although a common case
      To find our children running restive--they
    In whom our brightest days we would retrace,
      Our little selves re-formed in finer clay,
    Just as old age is creeping on apace,
      And clouds come o'er the sunset of our day,
    They kindly leave us, though not quite alone,
    But in good company--the gout or stone.

                      LX.

    Yet a fine family is a fine thing
      (Provided they don't come in after dinner);
    'T is beautiful to see a matron bring
      Her children up (if nursing them don't thin her);
    Like cherubs round an altar-piece they cling
      To the fire-side (a sight to touch a sinner).
    A lady with her daughters or her nieces
    Shine like a guinea and seven-shilling pieces.

                      LXI.

    Old Lambro passed unseen a private gate,
      And stood within his hall at eventide;
    Meantime the lady and her lover sate
      At wassail in their beauty and their pride:
    An ivory inlaid table spread with state
      Before them, and fair slaves on every side;[183]
    Gems, gold, and silver, formed the service mostly,
    Mother of pearl and coral the less costly.

                      LXII.

    The dinner made about a hundred dishes;
      Lamb and pistachio nuts--in short, all meats,
    And saffron soups, and sweetbreads; and the fishes
      Were of the finest that e'er flounced in nets,
    Dressed to a Sybarite's most pampered wishes;
      The beverage was various sherbets
    Of raisin, orange, and pomegranate juice,
    Squeezed through the rind, which makes it best for use.

                      LXIII.

    These were ranged round, each in its crystal ewer,
      And fruits, and date-bread loaves closed the repast,
    And Mocha's berry, from Arabia pure,
      In small fine China cups, came in at last;
    Gold cups of filigree, made to secure
      The hand from burning, underneath them placed;
    Cloves, cinnamon, and saffron too were boiled
    Up with the coffee, which (I think) they spoiled.

                      LXIV.

    The hangings of the room were tapestry, made
      Of velvet panels, each of different hue,
    And thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid;
      And round them ran a yellow border too;
    The upper border, richly wrought, displayed,
      Embroidered delicately o'er with blue,
    Soft Persian sentences, in lilac letters,
    From poets, or the moralists their betters.

                      LXV.

    These Oriental writings on the wall,
      Quite common in those countries, are a kind
    Of monitors adapted to recall,
      Like skulls at Memphian banquets, to the mind,
    The words which shook Belshazzar in his hall,
      And took his kingdom from him: You will find,
    Though sages may pour out their wisdom's treasure,
    There is no sterner moralist than Pleasure.

                      LXVI.

    A Beauty at the season's close grown hectic,
      A Genius who has drunk himself to death,
    A Rake turned methodistic, or Eclectic--[184]
      (For that's the name they like to pray beneath)--[cr]
    But most, an Alderman struck apoplectic,
      Are things that really take away the breath,--
    And show that late hours, wine, and love are able
    To do not much less damage than the table.

                      LXVII.

    Haidée and Juan carpeted their feet
      On crimson satin, bordered with pale blue;
    Their sofa occupied three parts complete
      Of the apartment--and appeared quite new;
    The velvet cushions (for a throne more meet)
      Were scarlet, from whose glowing centre grew
    A sun embossed in gold, whose rays of tissue,
    Meridian-like, were seen all light to issue.[cs]

                      LXVIII.

    Crystal and marble, plate and porcelain,
      Had done their work of splendour; Indian mats
    And Persian carpets, which the heart bled to stain,
      Over the floors were spread; gazelles and cats,
    And dwarfs and blacks, and such like things, that gain
      Their bread as ministers and favourites (that's
    To say, by degradation) mingled there
    As plentiful as in a court, or fair.

                      LXIX.

    There was no want of lofty mirrors, and
      The tables, most of ebony inlaid
    With mother of pearl or ivory, stood at hand,
      Or were of tortoise-shell or rare woods made,
    Fretted with gold or silver:--by command
      The greater part of these were ready spread
    With viands and sherbets in ice--and wine--
    Kept for all comers at all hours to dine.

                      LXX.

    Of all the dresses I select Haidée's:
      She wore two jelicks--one was of pale yellow;
    Of azure, pink, and white was her chemise--
      'Neath which her breast heaved like a little billow:
    With buttons formed of pearls as large as peas,
      All gold and crimson shone her jelick's fellow,
    And the striped white gauze baracan that bound her,
    Like fleecy clouds about the moon, flowed round her.

                      LXXI.

    One large gold bracelet clasped each lovely arm,
      Lockless--so pliable from the pure gold
    That the hand stretched and shut it without harm,
      The limb which it adorned its only mould;
    So beautiful--its very shape would charm,
      And clinging, as if loath to lose its hold,
    The purest ore enclosed the whitest skin
    That e'er by precious metal was held in.[185]

                      LXXII.

    Around, as Princess of her father's land,
      A like gold bar above her instep rolled[186]
    Announced her rank; twelve rings were on her hand;
      Her hair was starred with gems; her veil's fine fold
    Below her breast was fastened with a band
      Of lavish pearls, whose worth could scarce be told;
    Her orange silk full Turkish trousers furled
    About the prettiest ankle in the world.

                      LXXIII.

    Her hair's long auburn waves down to her heel
      Flowed like an Alpine torrent which the sun
    Dyes with his morning light,--and would conceal
      Her person[187] if allowed at large to run,
    And still they seemed resentfully to feel
      The silken fillet's curb, and sought to shun
    Their bonds whene'er some Zephyr caught began
    To offer his young pinion as her fan.

                      LXXIV.

    Round her she made an atmosphere of life,[188]
      The very air seemed lighter from her eyes,
    They were so soft and beautiful, and rife
      With all we can imagine of the skies,
    And pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife--
      Too pure even for the purest human ties;
    Her overpowering presence made you feel
    It would not be idolatry to kneel.[189]

                      LXXV.

    Her eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged
      (It is the country's custom, but in vain),
    For those large black eyes were so blackly fringed,
      The glossy rebels mocked the jetty stain,
    And in their native beauty stood avenged:
      Her nails were touched with henna; but, again,
    The power of Art was turned to nothing, for
    They could not look more rosy than before.

                      LXXVI.

    The henna should be deeply dyed to make
      The skin relieved appear more fairly fair;
    She had no need of this, day ne'er will break
      On mountain tops more heavenly white than her:
    The eye might doubt if it were well awake,
      She was so like a vision; I might err,
    But Shakespeare also says, 't is very silly
    "To gild refinéd gold, or paint the lily."[190]

                      LXXVII.

    Juan had on a shawl of black and gold,
      But a white baracan, and so transparent
    The sparkling gems beneath you might behold,
      Like small stars through the milky way apparent;
    His turban, furled in many a graceful fold,
      An emerald aigrette, with Haidée's hair in 't,
    Surmounted as its clasp--a glowing crescent,
    Whose rays shone ever trembling, but incessant.

                      LXXVIII.

    And now they were diverted by their suite,
      Dwarfs, dancing girls, black eunuchs, and a poet,
    Which made their new establishment complete;
      The last was of great fame, and liked to show it;
    His verses rarely wanted their due feet--
      And for his theme--he seldom sung below it,
    He being paid to satirise or flatter,
    As the Psalm says, "inditing a good matter."

                      LXXIX.

    He praised the present, and abused the past,
      Reversing the good custom of old days,
    An Eastern anti-jacobin at last
      He turned, preferring pudding to _no_ praise--
    For some few years his lot had been o'ercast
      By his seeming independent in his lays,
    But now he sung the Sultan and the Pacha--
    With truth like Southey, and with verse[191] like Crashaw.[ct]

                      LXXX.

    He was a man who had seen many changes,
      And always changed as true as any needle;
    His Polar Star being one which rather ranges,
      And not the fixed--he knew the way to wheedle:
    So vile he 'scaped the doom which oft avenges;
      And being fluent (save indeed when fee'd ill),
    He lied with such a fervour of intention--
    There was no doubt he earned his laureate pension.

                      LXXXI.

    But _he_ had genius,--when a turncoat has it,
      The _Vates irritabilis_[192] takes care
    That without notice few full moons shall pass it;
      Even good men like to make the public stare:--
    But to my subject--let me see--what was it?--
      Oh!--the third canto--and the pretty pair--
    Their loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode
    Of living in their insular abode.

                      LXXXII.

    Their poet, a sad trimmer, but, no less,[cu]
      In company a very pleasant fellow,
    Had been the favourite of full many a mess
      Of men, and made them speeches when half mellow;[cv]
    And though his meaning they could rarely guess,
      Yet still they deigned to hiccup or to bellow
    The glorious meed of popular applause,
    Of which the first ne'er knows the second cause.[cw]

                      LXXXIII.

    But now being lifted into high society,
      And having picked up several odds and ends
    Of free thoughts in his travels for variety,
      He deemed, being in a lone isle, among friends,
    That, without any danger of a riot, he
      Might for long lying make himself amends;
    And, singing as he sung in his warm youth,
    Agree to a short armistice with Truth.

                      LXXXIV.

    He had travelled 'mongst the Arabs, Turks, and Franks,
      And knew the self-loves of the different nations;
    And having lived with people of all ranks,
      Had something ready upon most occasions--
    Which got him a few presents and some thanks.
      He varied with some skill his adulations;
    To "do at Rome as Romans do,"[193] a piece
    Of conduct was which _he_ observed in Greece.

                      LXXXV.

    Thus, usually, when _he_ was asked to sing,
      He gave the different nations something national;
    'T was all the same to him--"God save the King,"
      Or "Ça ira," according to the fashion all:
    His Muse made increment of anything,
      From the high lyric down to the low rational;[cx][194]
    If Pindar sang horse-races, what should hinder
    Himself from being as pliable as Pindar?

                      LXXXVI.

    In France, for instance, he would write a chanson;
      In England a six canto quarto tale;
    In Spain he'd make a ballad or romance on
      The last war--much the same in Portugal;
    In Germany, the Pegasus he'd prance on
      Would be old Goethe's--(see what says De Staël);[195]
    In Italy he'd ape the "Trecentisti;"
    In Greece, he'd sing some sort of hymn like this t' ye:[196]

1.

    The Isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece!
      Where burning Sappho loved and sung,
    Where grew the arts of War and Peace,
      Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!
    Eternal summer gilds them yet,
    But all, except their Sun, is set.

2.

    The Scian and the Teian muse,
      The Hero's harp, the Lover's lute,
    Have found the fame your shores refuse:
      Their place of birth alone is mute
    To sounds which echo further west
    Than your Sires' "Islands of the Blest."[197]

3.

    The mountains look on Marathon--[cy]
      And Marathon looks on the sea;
    And musing there an hour alone,
      I dreamed that Greece might still be free;
    For standing on the Persians' grave,
    I could not deem myself a slave.

4.[198]

    A King sate on the rocky brow
      Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;
    And ships, by thousands, lay below,
      And men in nations;--all were his!
    He counted them at break of day--
    And, when the Sun set, where were they?

5.

    And where are they? and where art thou,
      My Country? On thy voiceless shore
    The heroic lay is tuneless now--
      The heroic bosom beats no more![cz]
    And must thy Lyre, so long divine,
    Degenerate into hands like mine?

6.

    'T is something, in the dearth of Fame,
      Though linked among a fettered race,
    To feel at least a patriot's shame,
      Even as I sing, suffuse my face;
    For what is left the poet here?
    For Greeks a blush--for Greece a tear.

7.

    Must _we_ but weep o'er days more blest?
      Must _we_ but blush?--Our fathers bled.
    Earth! render back from out thy breast
      A remnant of our Spartan dead!
    Of the three hundred grant but three,
    To make a new Thermopylæ!

8.

    What, silent still? and silent all?
      Ah! no;--the voices of the dead
    Sound like a distant torrent's fall,
      And answer, "Let one living head,
    But one arise,--we come, we come!"
    'T is but the living who are dumb.

9.

    In vain--in vain: strike other chords;
      Fill high the cup with Samian wine!
    Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,
      And shed the blood of Scio's vine!
    Hark! rising to the ignoble call--
    How answers each bold Bacchanal!

10.

    You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet,[199]
      Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?
    Of two such lessons, why forget
      The nobler and the manlier one?
    You have the letters Cadmus gave--
    Think ye he meant them for a slave?

11.

    Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
      We will not think of themes like these!
    It made Anacreon's song divine:
      He served--but served Polycrates--[200]
    A Tyrant; but our masters then
    Were still, at least, our countrymen.

12.

    The Tyrant of the Chersonese
      Was Freedom's best and bravest friend;
    _That_ tyrant was Miltiades!
      Oh! that the present hour would lend
    Another despot of the kind!
    Such chains as his were sure to bind.

13.

    Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
      On Suli's rock, and Parga's shore,
    Exists the remnant of a line
      Such as the Doric mothers bore;
    And there, perhaps, some seed is sown,
    The Heracleidan blood might own.[da]

14.

    Trust not for freedom to the Franks--[201]
      They have a king who buys and sells;
    In native swords, and native ranks,
      The only hope of courage dwells;
    But Turkish force, and Latin fraud,
    Would break your shield, however broad.

15.

    Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
      Our virgins dance beneath the shade--
    I see their glorious black eyes shine;
      But gazing on each glowing maid,
    My own the burning tear-drop laves,
    To think such breasts must suckle slaves.

16.

    Place me on Sunium's marbled steep,[202]
      Where nothing, save the waves and I,
    May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;
      There, swan-like, let me sing and die:
    A land of slaves shall ne'er be mine--
    Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!

                      LXXXVII.

    Thus sung, or would, or could, or should have sung,
      The modern Greek, in tolerable verse;
    If not like Orpheus quite, when Greece was young,
      Yet in these times he might have done much worse:
    His strain displayed some feeling--right or wrong;
      And feeling,[203] in a poet, is the source
    Of others' feeling; but they are such liars,
    And take all colours--like the hands of dyers.

                      LXXXVIII.

    But words are things,[204] and a small drop of ink,
      Falling like dew, upon a thought, produces
    That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think;
      'T is strange, the shortest letter which man uses
    Instead of speech, may form a lasting link
      Of ages; to what straits old Time reduces
    Frail man, when paper--even a rag like this,
    Survives himself, his tomb, and all that's his!

                      LXXXIX.

    And when his bones are dust, his grave a blank,
      His station, generation, even his nation,
    Become a thing, or nothing, save to rank
      In chronological commemoration,
    Some dull MS. Oblivion long has sank,
      Or graven stone found in a barrack's station
    In digging the foundation of a closet,[db]
    May turn his name up, as a rare deposit.

                      XC.

    And Glory long has made the sages smile;
      'T is something, nothing, words, illusion, wind--
    Depending more upon the historian's style
      Than on the name a person leaves behind:
    Troy owes to Homer what whist owes to Hoyle:[205]
      The present century was growing blind
    To the great Marlborough's skill in giving knocks,
    Until his late Life by Archdeacon Coxe.[206]

                      XCI.

    Milton's the Prince of poets--so we say;
      A little heavy, but no less divine:
    An independent being in his day--
      Learned, pious, temperate in love and wine;
    But, his life falling into Johnson's way,
      We're told this great High Priest of all the Nine
    Was whipped at college--a harsh sire--odd spouse,
    For the first Mrs. Milton left his house.[207]

                      XCII.

    All these are, _certes_, entertaining facts,
      Like Shakespeare's stealing deer, Lord Bacon's bribes;
    Like Titus' youth, and Cæsar's earliest acts;[208]
      Like Burns (whom Doctor Currie well describes);[209]
    Like Cromwell's pranks;[210]--but although Truth exacts
      These amiable descriptions from the scribes,
    As most essential to their Hero's story,
    They do not much contribute to his glory.

                      XCIII.

    All are not moralists, like Southey, when
      He prated to the world of "Pantisocracy;"[211]
    Or Wordsworth unexcised,[212] unhired, who then
      Seasoned his pedlar poems with Democracy;[dc]
    Or Coleridge[213] long before his flighty pen
      Let to the Morning Post its aristocracy;[dd]
    When he and Southey, following the same path,
    Espoused two partners (milliners of Bath).[214]

                      XCIV.

    Such names at present cut a convict figure,
      The very Botany Bay in moral geography;
    Their loyal treason, renegado rigour,
      Are good manure for their more bare biography;
    Wordsworth's last quarto, by the way, is bigger
      Than any since the birthday of typography;
    A drowsy, frowzy poem, called the "Excursion,"
    Writ in a manner which is my aversion.

                      XCV.

    He there builds up a formidable dyke
      Between his own and others' intellect;
    But Wordsworth's poem, and his followers, like
      Joanna Southcote's Shiloh[215] and her sect,
    Are things which in this century don't strike
      The public mind,--so few are the elect;
    And the new births of both their stale Virginities
    Have proved but Dropsies, taken for Divinities.

                      XCVI.

    But let me to my story: I must own,
      If I have any fault, it is digression,
    Leaving my people to proceed alone,
      While I soliloquize beyond expression:
    But these are my addresses from the throne,
      Which put off business to the ensuing session:
    Forgetting each omission is a loss to
    The world, not quite so great as Ariosto.

                      XCVII.

    I know that what our neighbours call _"longueurs,"_
      (We've not so good a _word_, but have the _thing_,
    In that complete perfection which insures
      An epic from Bob Southey every spring--)
    Form not the true temptation which allures
      The reader; but 't would not be hard to bring
    Some fine examples of the _Epopée_,
    To prove its grand ingredient is _Ennui_.[216]

                      XCVIII.

    We learn from Horace, "Homer sometimes sleeps;"[217]
      We feel without him,--Wordsworth sometimes wakes,--
    To show with what complacency he creeps,
      With his dear "_Waggoners_," around his lakes.[218]
    He wishes for "a boat" to sail the deeps--
      Of Ocean?--No, of air; and then he makes
    Another outcry for "a little boat,"
    And drivels seas to set it well afloat.[219]

                      XCIX.

    If he must fain sweep o'er the ethereal plain,
      And Pegasus runs restive in his "Waggon,"
    Could he not beg the loan of Charles's Wain?
      Or pray Medea for a single dragon?[220]
    Or if, too classic for his vulgar brain,
      He feared his neck to venture such a nag on,
    And he must needs mount nearer to the moon,
    Could not the blockhead ask for a balloon?

                      C.

    "Pedlars," and "Boats," and "Waggons!" Oh! ye shades
      Of Pope and Dryden, are we come to this?
    That trash of such sort not alone evades
      Contempt, but from the bathos' vast abyss
    Floats scumlike uppermost, and these Jack Cades
      Of sense and song above your graves may hiss--
    The "little boatman" and his _Peter Bell_
    Can sneer at him who drew "Achitophel!"[221]

    T' our tale.--The feast was over, the slaves gone,
      The dwarfs and dancing girls had all retired;
    The Arab lore and Poet's song were done,
      And every sound of revelry expired;
    The lady and her lover, left alone,
      The rosy flood of Twilight's sky admired;--
    Ave Maria! o'er the earth and sea,
    That heavenliest hour of Heaven is worthiest thee!

                      CII.

    Ave Maria! blesséd be the hour!
      The time, the clime, the spot, where I so oft
    Have felt that moment in its fullest power
      Sink o'er the earth--so beautiful and soft--
    While swung the deep bell in the distant tower,[de]
      Or the faint dying day-hymn stole aloft,
    And not a breath crept through the rosy air,
    And yet the forest leaves seemed stirred with prayer.

                      CIII.

    Ave Maria! 't is the hour of prayer!
      Ave Maria! 't is the hour of Love!
    Ave Maria! may our spirits dare
      Look up to thine and to thy Son's above!
    Ave Maria! oh that face so fair!
      Those downcast eyes beneath the Almighty Dove--
    What though 't is but a pictured image?--strike--
    That painting is no idol,--'t is too like.

                      CIV.

    Some kinder casuists are pleased to say,
      In nameless print[df]--that I have no devotion;
    But set those persons down with me to pray,
      And you shall see who has the properest notion
    Of getting into Heaven the shortest way;
      My altars are the mountains and the Ocean,
    Earth--air--stars,[222]--all that springs from the great Whole,
    Who hath produced, and will receive the Soul.

                      CV.

    Sweet Hour of Twilight!--in the solitude
      Of the pine forest, and the silent shore
    Which bounds Ravenna's immemorial wood,
      Rooted where once the Adrian wave flowed o'er,
    To where the last Cæsarean fortress stood,[223]
      Evergreen forest! which Boccaccio's lore
    And Dryden's lay made haunted ground to me,
    How have I loved the twilight hour and thee![224]

                      CVI.

    The shrill cicalas, people of the pine,
      Making their summer lives one ceaseless song,
    Were the sole echoes, save my steed's and mine,
      And Vesper bell's that rose the boughs along;
    The spectre huntsman of Onesti's line,
      His hell-dogs, and their chase, and the fair throng
    Which learned from this example not to fly
    From a true lover,--shadowed my mind's eye.[225]

                      CVII.

    Oh, Hesperus! thou bringest all good things--[226]
      Home to the weary, to the hungry cheer,
    To the young bird the parent's brooding wings,
      The welcome stall to the o'erlaboured steer;
    Whate'er of peace about our hearthstone clings,
      Whate'er our household gods protect of dear,
    Are gathered round us by thy look of rest;
    Thou bring'st the child, too, to the mother's breast.

                      CVIII.

    Soft Hour! which wakes the wish and melts the heart
      Of those who sail the seas, on the first day
    When they from their sweet friends are torn apart;
      Or fills with love the pilgrim on his way
    As the far bell of Vesper makes him start,
      Seeming to weep the dying day's decay;[227]
    Is this a fancy which our reason scorns?
    Ah! surely Nothing dies but Something mourns!

                      CIX.

    When Nero perished by the justest doom
      Which ever the Destroyer yet destroyed,
    Amidst the roar of liberated Rome,
      Of nations freed, and the world overjoyed,
    Some hands unseen strewed flowers upon his tomb:[228]
      Perhaps the weakness of a heart not void
    Of feeling for some kindness done, when Power
    Had left the wretch an uncorrupted hour.

                      CX.

    But I'm digressing; what on earth has Nero,
      Or any such like sovereign buffoons,[dg]
    To do with the transactions of my hero,
      More than such madmen's fellow man--the moon's?
    Sure my invention must be down at zero,
      And I grown one of many "Wooden Spoons"
    Of verse, (the name with which we Cantabs please
    To dub the last of honours in degrees).

                      CXI.

    I feel this tediousness will never do--
      T' is being _too_ epic, and I must cut down
    (In copying) this long canto into two;
      They'll never find it out, unless I own
    The fact, excepting some experienced few;
      And then as an improvement 't will be shown:

FOOTNOTES:

[169] [November 30, 1819. Copied in 1820 (MS.D.). Moore (_Life_, 421)
says that Byron was at work on the third canto when he stayed with him
at Venice, in October, 1819. "One day, before dinner, [he] read me two
or three hundred lines of it; beginning with the stanzas "Oh
Wellington," etc., which, at the time, formed the opening of the third
canto, but were afterwards reserved for the commencement of the ninth."
The third canto, as it now stands, was completed by November 8, 1819;
see _Letters_, 1900, iv. 375. The date on the MS. may refer to the first
fair copy.]

{160}[183] ["Almost all _Don Juan_ is _real_ life, either my own, or
from people I knew. By the way, much of the description of the
_furniture_, in Canto Third, is taken from _Tully's Tripoli_ (pray _note
this_), and the rest from my own observation. Remember, I never meant to
conceal this at all, and have only not stated it, because _Don Juan_ had
no preface, nor name to it."--Letter to Murray, August 23, 1821,
_Letters_, 1901, v. 346.

The first edition of _"Tully's Tripoli"_ is entitled _Narrative of a Ten
Years' Residence in Tripoli In Africa: From the original correspondence
in the possession of the Family of the late Richard Tully, Esq., the
British Consul_, 1816, 410. The book is in the form of letters (so says
the _Preface_) written by the Consul's sister. The description of
Haidée's _dress_ is taken from the account of a visit to Lilla Kebbiera,
the wife of the Bashaw (p. 30); the description of the furniture and
refreshments from the account of a visit to "Lilla Amnani," Hadgi
Abderrahmam's Greek wife (pp. 132-137). It is evident that the "Chiel"
who took _these_ "notes" was the Consul's _sister_, not the Consul:
"Lilla Aisha, the Bey's wife, is thought to be very sensible, though
rather haughty. Her apartments were grand, and herself superbly habited.
Her chemise was covered with gold embroidery at the neck; over it she
wore a gold and silver tissue _jileck_, or jacket without sleeves, and
over that another of purple velvet richly laced with gold, with coral
and pearl buttons set quite close together down the front; it had short
sleeves finished with a gold band not far below the shoulder, and
discovered a wide loose chemise of transparent gauze, with gold, silver,
and ribband strips. She wore round her ancles ... a sort of fetter made
of a thick bar of gold so fine that they bound it round the leg with one
hand; it is an inch and a half wide, and as much in thickness: each of
these weighs four pounds. Just above this a band three inches wide of
gold thread finished the ends of a pair of trousers made of pale yellow
and white silk."

Page 132. "[Lilla] rose to take coffee, which was served in very small
china cups, placed in silver filigree cups; and gold filigree cups were
put under those presented to the married ladies. They had introduced
cloves, cinnamon, and saffron into the coffee, which was abundantly
sweetened; but this mixture was very soon changed, and replaced by
excellent simple coffee for the European ladies...."

Page 133. "The Greek then shewed us the gala furniture of her own
room.... The hangings of the room were of tapestry, made in pannels of
different coloured velvets, thickly inlaid with flowers of silk damask;
a yellow border, of about a foot in depth, finished the tapestry at top
and bottom, the upper border being embroidered with Moorish sentences
from the Koran in lilac letters. The carpet was of crimson satin, with a
deep border of pale blue quilted; this is laid over Indian mats and
other carpets. In the best part of the room the sofa is placed, which
occupies three sides in an alcove, the floor of which is raised. The
sofa and the cushions that lay around were of crimson velvet, the centre
cushions were embroidered with a sun in gold of highly embossed work,
the rest were of gold and silver tissue. The curtains of the alcove were
made to match those before the bed. A number of looking-glasses, and a
profusion of fine china and chrystal completed the ornaments and
furniture of the room, in which were neither tables nor chairs. A small
table, about six inches high, is brought in when refreshments are
served; it is of ebony, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, tortoiseshell,
ivory, gold and silver, of choice woods, or of plain mahogany, according
to the circumstances of the proprietor."

Page 136. "On the tables were placed all sorts of refreshments, and
thirty or forty dishes of meat and poultry, dressed different ways;
there were no knives nor forks, and only a few spoons of gold, silver,
ivory, or coral...."

Page 137. "The beverage was various sherbets, some composed of the juice
of boiled raisins, very sweet; some of the juice of pomegranates
squeezed through the rind; and others of the pure juice of oranges.
These sherbets were copiously supplied in high glass ewers, placed in
great numbers on the ground.... After the dishes of meat were removed, a
dessert of Arabian fruits, confectionaries, and sweetmeats was served;
among the latter was the date-bread. This sweetmeat is made in
perfection only by the blacks at Fezzan, of the ripe date of the
country.... They make it in the shape of loaves, weighing from twenty to
thirty pounds; the stones of the fruit are taken out, and the dates
simply pressed together with great weights; thus preserved, it keeps
perfectly good for a year."]

{162}[184] ["He writes like a man who has that clear perception of the
truth of things which is the result of the guilty knowledge of good and
evil; and who, by the light of that knowledge, has deliberately
preferred the evil with a proud malignity of purpose, which would seem
to leave little for the last consummating change to accomplish. When he
calculates that the reader is on the verge of pitying him, he takes care
to throw him back the defiance of laughter, as if to let him know that
all the Poet's pathos is but the sentimentalism of the drunkard between
his cups, or the relenting softness of the courtesan, who the next
moment resumes the bad boldness of her degraded character. With such a
man, who would wish either to laugh or to weep?"--_Eclectic Review_

{164}[185] This dress is Moorish, and the bracelets and bar are worn in
the manner described. The reader will perceive hereafter, that as the
mother of Haidée was of Fez, her daughter wore the garb of the country.

[186] The bar of gold above the instep is a mark of sovereign rank in
the women of the families of the Deys, and is worn as such by their

[187] This is no exaggeration: there were four women whom I remember to
have seen, who possessed their hair in this profusion; of these, three
were English, the other was a Levantine. Their hair was of that length
and quantity, that, when let down, it almost entirely shaded the person,
so as nearly to render dress a superfluity. Of these, only one had dark
hair; the Oriental's had, perhaps, the lightest colour of the four.

Southey, now and again glances at Southey's eulogist.]

"Lord Byron," writes Finlay (_History of Greece_, vi. 335, note), "used
to describe an evening passed in the company of Londos [a Morean
landowner, who took part in the first and second Greek Civil Wars], at
Vostitza (in 1809), when both were young men, with a spirit that
rendered the scene worthy of a place in _Don Juan_. After supper Londos,
who had the face and figure of a chimpanzee, sprang upon a table, ...
and commenced singing through his nose Rhiga's Hymn to Liberty. A new
cadi, passing near the house, inquired the cause of the discordant
hubbub. A native Mussulman replied, 'It is only the young primate
Londos, who is drunk, and is singing hymns to the new panaghia of the
Greeks, whom they call Eleutheria.'" (See letter to Andreas Londos

(1817), (_Essays Moral and Political_, by Robert Southey, 1832, ii. 17),
speaks of his "purpose to retire with a few friends into the wilds of
America, and there lay the foundations of a community," etc.; but the
word "_Pantisocracy_" is not mentioned. It occurs, perhaps, for the
first time in print, in George Dyer's biographical sketch of Southey,
which he contributed to _Public Characters of 1799-1800_, p. 225,
"Coleridge, no less than Southey, possessed a strong passion for poetry.
They commenced, like two young poets, an enthusiastic friendship, and in
connection with others, struck out a plan for settling in America, and
for having all things in common. This scheme they called Pantisocracy."
Hence, the phrase must have "caught on," for, in a footnote to his

[214] [Coleridge was married to Sarah Fricker, October 5; Southey to her
younger sister Edith, November 15, 1795. Their father, Stephen Fricker,
who had been an innkeeper, and afterwards a potter at Bristol, migrated
to Bath about the year 1780. For the last six years of his life he was
owner and manager of a coal wharf. He had inherited a small fortune, and
his wife brought him money, but he died bankrupt, and left his family
destitute. His widow returned to Bristol, and kept a school. In a letter
to Murray, dated September 11, 1822 (_Letters_, 1901, vi. 113), Byron
quotes the authority of "Luttrell," and "his friend Mr. Nugent," for the
statement that Mrs. Southey and "Coleridge's Sara ... before they were
married ... were milliner's or dressmaker's apprentices." The story
rests upon their evidence. It is certain that in 1794, when Coleridge
appeared upon the scene, the sisters earned their living by going out to
work in the houses of friends, and were not, at that time, "milliners of
Bath."]

any general criticism on "him who drew _Achitophel_." In a letter to Sir
Walter Scott (November 7, 1805), then engaged on his great edition of
Dryden's _Works_, he admits that Dryden is not "as a poet any great
favourite of mine. I admire his talents and genius highly, but he is not
a poetical genius. The only qualities I can find in Dryden that are
_essentially_ poetical, are a certain ardour and impetuosity of mind,
with an excellent ear" (_Life of Wordsworth_, by W. Knight, 1889, ii.

subject of religion was at Ravenna, my native country, in 1820, while we
were riding on horseback in an extensive solitary wood of pines. The
scene invited to religious meditation. It was a fine day in spring.
'How,' he said, 'raising our eyes to heaven, or directing them to the
earth, can we doubt of the existence of God?--or how, turning them to
what is within us, can we doubt that there is something more noble and
durable than the clay of which we are formed?'"--Count Gamba.]

{180}[225] [If the _Pineta_ of Ravenna, _bois funèbre_, invited Byron
"to religious meditation," the mental picture of the "spectre huntsman"
pursuing his eternal vengeance on "the inexorable dame"--"that fatal
she," who had mocked his woes--must have set in motion another train of
thought. Such lines as these would "speak comfortably" to him--

    "Because she deem'd I well deserved to die,

    Mine is the ungrateful maid by heaven design'd:

             CANTO THE FOURTH.

                      I.

    NOTHING so difficult as a beginning
      In poesy, unless perhaps the end;
    For oftentimes when Pegasus seems winning
      The race, he sprains a wing, and down we tend,
    Like Lucifer when hurled from Heaven for sinning;
      Our sin the same, and hard as his to mend,
    Being Pride,[230] which leads the mind to soar too far,
    Till our own weakness shows us what we are.

                      II.

    But Time, which brings all beings to their level,
      And sharp Adversity, will teach at last
    Man,--and, as we would hope,--perhaps the Devil,
      That neither of their intellects are vast:
    While Youth's hot wishes in our red veins revel,
      We know not this--the blood flows on too fast;
    But as the torrent widens towards the Ocean,
    We ponder deeply on each past emotion.[231]

                      III.

    As boy, I thought myself a clever fellow,
      And wished that others held the same opinion;
    They took it up when my days grew more mellow,
      And other minds acknowledged my dominion:
    Now my sere Fancy "falls into the yellow
      Leaf,"[232] and Imagination droops her pinion,
    And the sad truth which hovers o'er my desk
    Turns what was once romantic to burlesque.

                      IV.

    And if I laugh at any mortal thing,
      'T is that I may not weep; and if I weep,
    'T is that our nature cannot always bring
      Itself to apathy, for we must steep[dh]
    Our hearts first in the depths of Lethe's spring,[di]
      Ere what we least wish to behold will sleep:
    Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx;
    A mortal mother would on Lethe fix.

                      V.

    Some have accused me of a strange design
      Against the creed and morals of the land,
    And trace it in this poem every line:
      I don't pretend that I quite understand
    My own meaning when I would be _very_ fine;
      But the fact is that I have nothing planned,
    Unless it were to be a moment merry--
    A novel word in my vocabulary.

                      VI.

    To the kind reader of our sober clime
      This way of writing will appear exotic;
    Pulci[233] was sire of the half-serious rhyme,[dj]
      Who sang when Chivalry was more quixotic,
    And revelled in the fancies of the time,
      True Knights, chaste Dames, huge Giants, Kings despotic;
    But all these, save the last, being obsolete,
    I chose a modern subject as more meet.

                      VII.

    How I have treated it, I do not know;
      Perhaps no better than _they_ have treated me,
    Who have imputed such designs as show
      Not what they saw, but what they wished to see:
    But if it gives them pleasure, be it so;
      This is a liberal age, and thoughts are free:
    Meantime Apollo plucks me by the ear,
    And tells me to resume my story here.[234]

                      VIII.

    Young Juan and his lady-love were left
      To their own hearts' most sweet society;
    Even Time the pitiless in sorrow cleft
      With his rude scythe such gentle bosoms; he
    Sighed to behold them of their hours bereft,
      Though foe to Love; and yet they could not be
    Meant to grow old, but die in happy Spring,
    Before one charm or hope had taken wing.

                      IX.

    Their faces were not made for wrinkles, their
      Pure blood to stagnate, their great hearts to fail;
    The blank grey was not made to blast their hair,
      But like the climes that know nor snow nor hail,
    They were all summer; lightning might assail
      And shiver them to ashes, but to trail
    A long and snake-like life of dull decay
    Was not for them--they had too little clay.

                      X.

    They were alone once more; for them to be
      Thus was another Eden; they were never
    Weary, unless when separate: the tree
      Cut from its forest root of years--the river
    Dammed from its fountain--the child from the knee
      And breast maternal weaned at once for ever,--
    Would wither less than these two torn apart;[dk]
    Alas! there is no instinct like the Heart--

                      XI.

    The Heart--which may be broken: happy they!
      Thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,
    The precious porcelain of human clay,
      Break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold
    The long year linked with heavy day on day,
      And all which must be borne, and never told;
    While Life's strange principle will often lie
    Deepest in those who long the most to die.

                      XII.

    "Whom the gods love die young," was said of yore,[235]
      And many deaths do they escape by this:
    The death of friends, and that which slays even more--
      The death of Friendship, Love, Youth, all that is,
    Except mere breath; and since the silent shore
      Awaits at last even those who longest miss
    The old Archer's shafts, perhaps the early grave[236]
    Which men weep over may be meant to save.

                      XIII.

    Haidée and Juan thought not of the dead--
      The Heavens, and Earth, and Air, seemed made for them:
    They found no fault with Time, save that he fled;
      They saw not in themselves aught to condemn:
    Each was the other's mirror, and but read
      Joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem.
    And knew such brightness was but the reflection
    Of their exchanging glances of affection.

                      XIV.

    The gentle pressure, and the thrilling touch,
      The least glance better understood than words,
    Which still said all, and ne'er could say too much;
      A language,[237] too, but like to that of birds,
    Known but to them, at least appearing such
      As but to lovers a true sense affords;
    Sweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd
    To those who have ceased to hear such, or ne'er heard--

                      XV.

    All these were theirs, for they were children still,
      And children still they should have ever been;
    They were not made in the real world to fill
      A busy character in the dull scene,
    But like two beings born from out a rill,
      A Nymph and her belovéd, all unseen
    To pass their lives in fountains and on flowers,
    And never know the weight of human hours.

                      XVI.

    Moons changing had rolled on, and changeless found
      Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys
    As rarely they beheld throughout their round;
      And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,
    For theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound
      By the mere senses; and that which destroys[dl]
    Most love--possession--unto them appeared
    A thing which each endearment more endeared.

                      XVII.

    Oh beautiful! and rare as beautiful!
      But theirs was Love in which the Mind delights
    To lose itself, when the old world grows dull,
      And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,
    Intrigues, adventures of the common school,
      Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,
    Where Hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,
    Whose husband only knows her not a whore.

                      XVIII.

    Hard words--harsh truth! a truth which many know.
      Enough.--The faithful and the fairy pair,
    Who never found a single hour too slow,
      What was it made them thus exempt from care?
    Young innate feelings all have felt below,
      Which perish in the rest, but in them were
    Inherent--what we mortals call romantic,
    And always envy, though we deem it frantic.

                      XIX.

    This is in others a factitious state,
      An opium dream[238] of too much youth and reading,
    But was in them their nature or their fate:
      No novels e'er had set their young hearts bleeding,[dm]
    For Haidée's knowledge was by no means great,
      And Juan was a boy of saintly breeding;
    So that there was no reason for their loves
    More than for those of nightingales or doves.

                      XX.

    They gazed upon the sunset; 't is an hour
      Dear unto all, but dearest to _their_ eyes,
    For it had made them what they were: the power
      Of Love had first o'erwhelmed them from such skies,
    When Happiness had been their only dower,
      And Twilight saw them linked in Passion's ties;
    Charmed with each other, all things charmed that brought
    The past still welcome as the present thought.

                      XXI.

    I know not why, but in that hour to-night,
      Even as they gazed, a sudden tremor came,
    And swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,
      Like the wind o'er a harp-string, or a flame,
    When one is shook in sound, and one in sight:
      And thus some boding flashed through either frame,
    And called from Juan's breast a faint low sigh,
    While one new tear arose in Haidée's eye.

                      XXII.

    That large black prophet eye seemed to dilate
      And follow far the disappearing sun,
    As if their last day of a happy date
      With his broad, bright, and dropping orb were gone;
    Juan gazed on her as to ask his fate--
      He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,
    His glance inquired of hers for some excuse
    For feelings causeless, or at least abstruse.

                      XXIII.

    She turned to him, and smiled, but in that sort
      Which makes not others smile; then turned aside:
    Whatever feeling shook her, it seemed short,
      And mastered by her wisdom or her pride;
    When Juan spoke, too--it might be in sport--
      Of this their mutual feeling, she replied--
    "If it should be so,--but--it cannot be--
    Or I at least shall not survive to see."

                      XXIV.

    Juan would question further, but she pressed
      His lip to hers, and silenced him with this,
    And then dismissed the omen from her breast,
      Defying augury with that fond kiss;
    And no doubt of all methods 't is the best:
      Some people prefer wine--'t is not amiss;
    I have tried both--so those who would a part take
    May choose between the headache and the heartache.

                      XXV.

    One of the two, according to your choice,
      Woman or wine, you'll have to undergo;
    Both maladies are taxes on our joys:
      But which to choose, I really hardly know;
    And if I had to give a casting voice,
      For both sides I could many reasons show,
    And then decide, without great wrong to either,
    It were much better to have both than neither.

                      XXVI.

    Juan and Haidée gazed upon each other
      With swimming looks of speechless tenderness,
    Which mixed all feelings--friend, child, lover, brother--
      All that the best can mingle and express
    When two pure hearts are poured in one another,
      And love too much, and yet can not love less;
    But almost sanctify the sweet excess
    By the immortal wish and power to bless.

                      XXVII.

    Mixed in each other's arms, and heart in heart,
      Why did they not then die?--they had lived too long
    Should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;
      Years could but bring them cruel things or wrong;
    The World was not for them--nor the World's art
      For beings passionate as Sappho's song;
    Love was born _with_ them, _in_ them, so intense,
    It was their very Spirit--not a sense.

                      XXVIII.

    They should have lived together deep in woods,
      Unseen as sings the nightingale;[239] they were
    Unfit to mix in these thick solitudes
      Called social, haunts of Hate, and Vice, and Care:[dn]
    How lonely every freeborn creature broods!
      The sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;
    The eagle soars alone; the gull and crow
    Flock o'er their carrion, just like men below.

                      XXIX.

    Now pillowed cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,
      Haidée and Juan their siesta took,
    A gentle slumber, but it was not deep,
      For ever and anon a something shook
    Juan, and shuddering o'er his frame would creep;
      And Haidée's sweet lips murmured like a brook
    A wordless music, and her face so fair
    Stirred with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air.[do]

                      XXX.

    Or as the stirring of a deep clear stream
      Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind
    Walks o'er it, was she shaken by the dream,
      The mystical Usurper of the mind--
    O'erpowering us to be whate'er may seem
      Good to the soul which we no more can bind;
    Strange state of being! (for 't is still to be)
    Senseless to feel, and with sealed eyes to see.[dp]

                      XXXI.

    She dreamed of being alone on the sea-shore,
      Chained to a rock; she knew not how, but stir
    She could not from the spot, and the loud roar
      Grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;
    And o'er her upper lip they seemed to pour,
      Until she sobbed for breath, and soon they were
    Foaming o'er her lone head, so fierce and high--
    Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die.

                      XXXII.

    Anon--she was released, and then she strayed
      O'er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,
    And stumbled almost every step she made:
      And something rolled before her in a sheet,
    Which she must still pursue howe'er afraid:
      'T was white and indistinct, nor stopped to meet
    Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed and grasped,
    And ran, but it escaped her as she clasped.

                      XXXIII.

    The dream changed:--in a cave[240] she stood, its walls
      Were hung with marble icicles; the work
    Of ages on its water-fretted halls,
      Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;
    Her hair was dripping, and the very balls
      Of her black eyes seemed turned to tears, and mirk
    The sharp rocks looked below each drop they caught,
    Which froze to marble as it fell,--she thought.[dq]

                      XXXIV.

    And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,
      Pale as the foam that frothed on his dead brow,
    Which she essayed in vain to clear, (how sweet
      Were once her cares, how idle seemed they now!)
    Lay Juan, nor could aught renew the beat
      Of his quenched heart: and the sea dirges low
    Rang in her sad ears like a Mermaid's song,
    And that brief dream appeared a life too long.

                      XXXV.

    And gazing on the dead, she thought his face
      Faded, or altered into something new--
    Like to her Father's features, till each trace
      More like and like to Lambro's aspect grew--
    With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;
      And starting, she awoke, and what to view?
    Oh! Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she there?
    'T is--'t is her Father's--fixed upon the pair!

                      XXXVI.

    Then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,
      With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see
    Him whom she deemed a habitant where dwell
      The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be
    Perchance the death of one she loved too well:
      Dear as her father had been to Haidée,
    It was a moment of that awful kind--
    I have seen such--but must not call to mind.

                      XXXVII.

    Up Juan sprang to Haidée's bitter shriek,
      And caught her falling, and from off the wall
    Snatched down his sabre, in hot haste to wreak
      Vengeance on him who was the cause of all:
    Then Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,
      Smiled scornfully, and said, "Within my call,
    A thousand scimitars await the word;
    Put up, young man, put up your silly sword."

                      XXXVIII.

    And Haidée clung around him; "Juan, 't is--
      'T is Lambro--'t is my father! Kneel with me--
    He will forgive us--yes--it must be--yes.
      Oh! dearest father, in this agony
    Of pleasure and of pain--even while I kiss
      Thy garment's hem with transport, can it be
    That doubt should mingle with my filial joy?
    Deal with me as thou wilt, but spare this boy."

                      XXXIX.

    High and inscrutable the old man stood,
      Calm in his voice, and calm within his eye--
    Not always signs with him of calmest mood:
      He looked upon her, but gave no reply;
    Then turned to Juan, in whose cheek the blood
      Oft came and went, as there resolved to die;
    In arms, at least, he stood, in act to spring
    On the first foe whom Lambro's call might bring.

                      XL.

    "Young man, your sword;" so Lambro once more said:
      Juan replied, "Not while this arm is free."
    The old man's cheek grew pale, but not with dread,
      And drawing from his belt a pistol he
    Replied, "Your blood be then on your own head."
      Then looked close at the flint, as if to see
    'T was fresh--for he had lately used the lock--
    And next proceeded quietly to cock.

                      XLI.

    It has a strange quick jar upon the ear,
      That cocking of a pistol, when you know
    A moment more will bring the sight to bear
      Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so;
    A gentlemanly distance, not too near,
      If you have got a former friend for foe;
    But after being fired at once or twice,
    The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice.

                      XLII.

    Lambro presented, and one instant more
      Had stopped this Canto, and Don Juan's breath,
    When Haidée threw herself her boy before;
      Stern as her sire: "On me," she cried, "let Death
    Descend--the fault is mine; this fatal shore
      He found--but sought not. I have pledged my faith;
    I love him--I will die with him: I knew
    Your nature's firmness--know your daughter's too."

                      XLIII.

    A minute past, and she had been all tears,
      And tenderness, and infancy; but now
    She stood as one who championed human fears--
      Pale, statue-like, and stern, she wooed the blow;
    And tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,
      She drew up to her height, as if to show
    A fairer mark; and with a fixed eye scanned
    Her Father's face--but never stopped his hand.

                      XLIV.

    He gazed on her, and she on him; 't was strange
      How like they looked! the expression was the same;
    Serenely savage, with a little change
      In the large dark eye's mutual--darted flame;
    For she, too, was as one who could avenge,
      If cause should be--a Lioness, though tame.
    Her Father's blood before her Father's face
    Boiled up, and proved her truly of his race.

                      XLV.

    I said they were alike, their features and
      Their stature, differing but in sex and years;
    Even to the delicacy of their hand[241]
      There was resemblance, such as true blood wears;
    And now to see them, thus divided, stand
      In fixed ferocity, when joyous tears
    And sweet sensations should have welcomed both,
    Shows what the passions are in their full growth.

                      XLVI.

    The father paused a moment, then withdrew
      His weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,
    And looking on her, as to look her through,
      "Not _I_," he said, "have sought this stranger's ill;
    Not _I_ have made this desolation: few
      Would bear such outrage, and forbear to kill;
    But I must do my duty--how thou hast
    Done thine, the present vouches for the past.[dr]

                      XLVII.

    "Let him disarm; or, by my father's head,
      His own shall roll before you like a ball!"
    He raised his whistle, as the word he said,
      And blew; another answered to the call,
    And rushing in disorderly, though led,
      And armed from boot to turban, one and all,
    Some twenty of his train came, rank on rank;
    He gave the word,--"Arrest or slay the Frank."

                      XLVIII.

    Then, with a sudden movement, he withdrew
      His daughter; while compressed within his clasp,
    Twixt her and Juan interposed the crew;
      In vain she struggled in her father's grasp--
    His arms were like a serpent's coil: then flew
      Upon their prey, as darts an angry asp,
    The file of pirates--save the foremost, who
    Had fallen, with his right shoulder half cut through.

                      XLIX.

    The second had his cheek laid open; but
      The third, a wary, cool old sworder, took
    The blows upon his cutlass, and then put
      His own well in; so well, ere you could look,
    His man was floored, and helpless at his foot,
      With the blood running like a little brook
    From two smart sabre gashes, deep and red--
    One on the arm, the other on the head.

                      L.

    And then they bound him where he fell, and bore
      Juan from the apartment: with a sign
    Old Lambro bade them take him to the shore,
      Where lay some ships which were to sail at nine.[ds]
    They laid him in a boat, and plied the oar
      Until they reached some galliots, placed in line;
    On board of one of these, and under hatches,
    They stowed him, with strict orders to the watches.

                      LI.

    The world is full of strange vicissitudes,
      And here was one exceedingly unpleasant:
    A gentleman so rich in the world's goods,
      Handsome and young, enjoying all the present,[dt]
    Just at the very time when he least broods
      On such a thing, is suddenly to sea sent,
    Wounded and chained, so that he cannot move,
    And all because a lady fell in love.

                      LII.

    Here I must leave him, for I grow pathetic,
      Moved by the Chinese nymph of tears, green tea!
    Than whom Cassandra was not more prophetic;
      For if my pure libations exceed three,
    I feel my heart become so sympathetic,
      That I must have recourse to black Bohea:
    'T is pity wine should be so deleterious,
    For tea and coffee leave us much more serious,

                      LIII.

    Unless when qualified with thee, Cogniac!
      Sweet Naïad of the Phlegethontic rill!
    Ah! why the liver wilt thou thus attack,[du]--
      And make, like other nymphs, thy lovers ill?
    I would take refuge in weak punch, but _rack_
      (In each sense of the word), whene'er I fill
    My mild and midnight beakers to the brim,
    Wakes me next morning with its synonym.[242]

                      LIV.

    I leave Don Juan for the present, safe--
      Not sound, poor fellow, but severely wounded;
    Yet could his corporal pangs amount to half
      Of those with which his Haidée's bosom bounded?
    She was not one to weep, and rave, and chafe,
      And then give way, subdued because surrounded;
    Her mother was a Moorish maid from Fez,
    Where all is Eden, or a wilderness.

                      LV.

    There the large olive rains its amber store
      In marble fonts; there grain, and flower, and fruit,
    Gush from the earth until the land runs o'er;[243]
      But there, too, many a poison-tree has root,
    And Midnight listens to the lion's roar,
      And long, long deserts scorch the camel's foot,
    Or heaving whelm the helpless caravan;
    And as the soil is, so the heart of man.

                      LVI.

    Afric is all the Sun's, and as her earth
      Her human clay is kindled; full of power
    For good or evil, burning from its birth,
      The Moorish blood partakes the planet's hour,
    And like the soil beneath it will bring forth:
      Beauty and love were Haidée's mother's dower;
    But her large dark eye showed deep Passion's force,
    Though sleeping like a lion near a source.[dv]

                      LVII.

    Her daughter, tempered with a milder ray,
      Like summer clouds all silvery, smooth, and fair,
    Till slowly charged with thunder they display
      Terror to earth, and tempest to the air,
    Had held till now her soft and milky way;
      But overwrought with Passion and Despair,
    The fire burst forth from her Numidian veins,
    Even as the Simoom[244] sweeps the blasted plains.

                      LVIII.

    The last sight which she saw was Juan's gore,
      And he himself o'ermastered and cut down;
    His blood was running on the very floor
      Where late he trod, her beautiful, her own;
    Thus much she viewed an instant and no more,--
      Her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan;
    On her Sire's arm, which until now scarce held
    Her writhing, fell she like a cedar felled.

                      LIX.

    A vein had burst, and her sweet lips' pure dyes[dw]
      Were dabbled with the deep blood which ran o'er;[245]
    And her head drooped, as when the lily lies
      O'ercharged with rain: her summoned handmaids bore
    Their lady to her couch with gushing eyes;
      Of herbs and cordials they produced their store,
    But she defied all means they could employ,
    Like one Life could not hold, nor Death destroy.

                      LX.

    Days lay she in that state unchanged, though chill--
      With nothing livid, still her lips were red;
    She had no pulse, but Death seemed absent still;
      No hideous sign proclaimed her surely dead;
    Corruption came not in each mind to kill
      All hope; to look upon her sweet face bred
    New thoughts of Life, for it seemed full of soul--
    She had so much, Earth could not claim the whole.

                      LXI.

    The ruling passion, such as marble shows
      When exquisitely chiselled, still lay there,
    But fixed as marble's unchanged aspect throws
      O'er the fair Venus, but for ever fair;[246]
    O'er the Laocoon's all eternal throes,
      And ever-dying Gladiator's air,
    Their energy like life forms all their fame,
    Yet looks not life, for they are still the same.--[dx]

                      LXII.

    She woke at length, but not as sleepers wake,
      Rather the dead, for Life seemed something new,
    A strange sensation which she must partake
      Perforce, since whatsoever met her view
    Struck not on memory, though a heavy ache
      Lay at her heart, whose earliest beat still true
    Brought back the sense of pain without the cause,
    For, for a while, the Furies made a pause.

                      LXIII.

    She looked on many a face with vacant eye,
      On many a token without knowing what:
    She saw them watch her without asking why,
      And recked not who around her pillow sat;
    Not speechless, though she spoke not--not a sigh
      Relieved her thoughts--dull silence and quick chat
    Were tried in vain by those who served; she gave
    No sign, save breath, of having left the grave.

                      LXIV.

    Her handmaids tended, but she heeded not;
      Her Father watched, she turned her eyes away;
    She recognised no being, and no spot,
      However dear or cherished in their day;
    They changed from room to room--but all forgot--
      Gentle, but without memory she lay;
    At length those eyes, which they would fain be weaning
    Back to old thoughts, waxed full of fearful meaning.

                      LXV.

    And then a slave bethought her of a harp;
      The harper came, and tuned his instrument;
    At the first notes, irregular and sharp,
      On him her flashing eyes a moment bent,
    Then to the wall she turned as if to warp
      Her thoughts from sorrow through her heart re-sent;
    And he began a long low island-song
    Of ancient days, ere Tyranny grew strong.

                      LXVI.

    Anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall
      In time to his old tune: he changed the theme,
    And sung of Love; the fierce name struck through all
      Her recollection; on her flashed the dream
    Of what she was, and is, if ye could call
      To be so being; in a gushing stream
    The tears rushed forth from her o'erclouded brain,
    Like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain.

                      LXVII.

    Short solace, vain relief!--Thought came too quick,
      And whirled her brain to madness; she arose
    As one who ne'er had dwelt among the sick,
      And flew at all she met, as on her foes;
    But no one ever heard her speak or shriek,
      Although her paroxysm drew towards its close;--
    Hers was a frenzy which disdained to rave,
    Even when they smote her, in the hope to save.

                      LXVIII.

    Yet she betrayed at times a gleam of sense;
      Nothing could make her meet her Father's face,
    Though on all other things with looks intense
      She gazed, but none she ever could retrace;
    Food she refused, and raiment; no pretence
      Availed for either; neither change of place,
    Nor time, nor skill, nor remedy, could give her
    Senses to sleep--the power seemed gone for ever.

                      LXIX.

    Twelve days and nights she withered thus; at last,
      Without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show
    A parting pang, the spirit from her passed:
      And they who watched her nearest could not know
    The very instant, till the change that cast
      Her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,[dy]
    Glazed o'er her eyes--the beautiful, the black--
    Oh! to possess such lustre--and then lack!

                      LXX.

    She died, but not alone; she held, within,
      A second principle of Life, which might
    Have dawned a fair and sinless child of sin;[dz]
      But closed its little being without light,
    And went down to the grave unborn, wherein
      Blossom and bough lie withered with one blight;
    In vain the dews of Heaven descend above
    The bleeding flower and blasted fruit of Love.

                      LXXI.

    Thus lived--thus died she; never more on her
      Shall Sorrow light, or Shame. She was not made
    Through years or moons the inner weight to bear,
      Which colder hearts endure till they are laid
    By age in earth: her days and pleasures were
      Brief, but delightful--such as had not staid
    Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well[247]
    By the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell.

                      LXXII.

    That isle is now all desolate and bare,
      Its dwellings down, its tenants passed away;
    None but her own and Father's grave is there,
      And nothing outward tells of human clay;
    Ye could not know where lies a thing so fair,
      No stone is there to show, no tongue to say,
    What was; no dirge, except the hollow sea's,[ea]
    Mourns o'er the beauty of the Cyclades.

                      LXXIII.

    But many a Greek maid in a loving song
      Sighs o'er her name; and many an islander
    With her Sire's story makes the night less long;
      Valour was his, and Beauty dwelt with her:
    If she loved rashly, her life paid for wrong--
      A heavy price must all pay who thus err,
    In some shape; let none think to fly the danger,
    For soon or late Love is his own avenger.

                      LXXIV.

    But let me change this theme, which grows too sad,
      And lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf;
    I don't much like describing people mad,
      For fear of seeming rather touched myself--
    Besides, I've no more on this head to add;
      And as my Muse is a capricious elf,
    We'll put about, and try another tack
    With Juan, left half-killed some stanzas back.

                      LXXV.

    Wounded and fettered, "cabined, cribbed, confined,"[248]
      Some days and nights elapsed before that he
    Could altogether call the past to mind;
      And when he did, he found himself at sea,
    Sailing six knots an hour before the wind;
      The shores of Ilion lay beneath their lee--
    Another time he might have liked to see 'em,
    But now was not much pleased with Cape Sigeum.

                      LXXVI.

    There, on the green and village-cotted hill, is
      (Flanked by the Hellespont, and by the sea)
    Entombed the bravest of the brave, Achilles;
      They say so--(Bryant[249] says the contrary):
    And further downward, tall and towering still, is
      The tumulus--of whom? Heaven knows! 't may be
    Patroclus, Ajax, or Protesilaus--
    All heroes, who if living still would slay us.[eb]

                      LXXVII.

    High barrows, without marble, or a name,
      A vast, untilled, and mountain-skirted plain,[ec]
    And Ida in the distance, still the same,
      And old Scamander (if 't is he) remain;
    The situation seems still formed for fame--
      A hundred thousand men might fight again,
    With ease; but where I sought for Ilion's walls,
    The quiet sheep feeds, and the tortoise[250] crawls;[ed]

                      LXXVIII.

    Troops of untended horses; here and there
      Some little hamlets, with new names uncouth;
    Some shepherds (unlike Paris) led to stare
      A moment at the European youth
    Whom to the spot their school-boy feelings bear;[ee]
      A Turk, with beads in hand, and pipe in mouth,
    Extremely taken with his own religion,
    Are what I found there--but the devil a Phrygian.

                      LXXIX.

    Don Juan, here permitted to emerge
      From his dull cabin, found himself a slave;
    Forlorn, and gazing on the deep blue surge,
      O'ershadowed there by many a Hero's grave;
    Weak still with loss of blood, he scarce could urge
      A few brief questions; and the answers gave
    No very satisfactory information
    About his past or present situation.

                      LXXX.

    He saw some fellow captives, who appeared
      To be Italians (as they were in fact)--
    From them, at least, _their_ destiny he heard,
      Which was an odd one; a troop going to act
    In Sicily--all singers, duly reared
      In their vocation, had not been attacked
    In sailing from Livorno by the pirate,
    But sold by the _impresario_ at no high rate.[251]

                      LXXXI.

    By one of these, the _buffo_[252] of the party,
      Juan was told about their curious case;
    For although destined to the Turkish mart, he
      Still kept his spirits up--at least his face;
    The little fellow really looked quite hearty,
      And bore him with some gaiety and grace,
    Showing a much more reconciled demeanour,
    Than did the prima donna and the tenor.

                      LXXXII.

    In a few words he told their hapless story,
      Saying, "Our Machiavelian _impresario_,
    Making a signal off some promontory,
      Hailed a strange brig--_Corpo di Caio Mario!_
    We were transferred on board her in a hurry,
      Without a single scudo of _salario_;
    But if the Sultan has a taste for song,
    We will revive our fortunes before long.

                      LXXXIII.

    "The prima donna, though a little old,
      And haggard with a dissipated life,
    And subject, when the house is thin, to cold,
      Has some good notes; and then the tenor's wife,
    With no great voice, is pleasing to behold;
      Last carnival she made a deal of strife,
    By carrying off Count Cesare Cicogna
    From an old Roman Princess at Bologna.

                      LXXXIV.

    "And then there are the dancers; there's the Nini,
      With more than one profession gains by all;
    Then there's that laughing slut the Pelegrini,
      She, too, was fortunate last Carnival,
    And made at least five hundred good _zecchini_,
      But spends so fast, she has not now a paul;
    And then there's the Grotesca--such a dancer!
    Where men have souls or bodies she must answer.

                      LXXXV.

    "As for the _figuranti_,[253] they are like
      The rest of all that tribe; with here and there
    A pretty person, which perhaps may strike--
      The rest are hardly fitted for a fair;
    There's one, though tall and stiffer than a pike,
      Yet has a sentimental kind of air
    Which might go far, but she don't dance with vigour--
    The more's the pity, with her face and figure.

                      LXXXVI.

    "As for the men, they are a middling set;
      The _musico_ is but a cracked old basin,
    But, being qualified in one way yet,
      May the seraglio do to set his face in,[ef]
    And as a servant some preferment get;
      His singing I no further trust can place in:
    From all the Pope[254] makes yearly 't would perplex
    To find three perfect pipes of the _third_ sex.

                      LXXXVII.

    "The tenor's voice is spoilt by affectation;
      And for the bass, the beast can only bellow--
    In fact, he had no singing education,
      An ignorant, noteless, timeless, tuneless fellow;
    But being the prima donna's near relation,
      Who swore his voice was very rich and mellow,
    They hired him, though to hear him you'd believe
    An ass was practising recitative.

                      LXXXVIII.

    "'T would not become myself to dwell upon
      My own merits, and though young--I see, Sir--you
    Have got a travelled air, which speaks you one
      To whom the opera is by no means new:
    You've heard of Raucocanti?--I'm the man;
      The time may come when you may hear me too;
    You was[255] not last year at the fair of Lugo,
    But next, when I'm engaged to sing there--do go.

                      LXXXIX.

    "Our baritone I almost had forgot,
      A pretty lad, but bursting with conceit;
    With graceful action, science not a jot,
      A voice of no great compass, and not sweet,
    He always is complaining of his lot,
      Forsooth, scarce fit for ballads in the street;
    In lovers' parts his passion more to breathe,
    Having no heart to show, he shows his teeth."[eg]

                      XC.

    Here Raucocanti's eloquent recital
      Was interrupted by the pirate crew,
    Who came at stated moments to invite all
      The captives back to their sad berths; each threw
    A rueful glance upon the waves, (which bright all
      From the blue skies derived a double blue,
    Dancing all free and happy in the sun,)
    And then went down the hatchway one by one.

                      XCI.

    They heard next day--that in the Dardanelles,
      Waiting for his Sublimity's firman,[256]
    The most imperative of sovereign spells,
      Which everybody does without who can,
    More to secure them in their naval cells,
      Lady to lady, well as man to man,
    Were to be chained and lotted out per couple,
    For the slave market of Constantinople.

                      XCII.

    It seems when this allotment was made out,
      There chanced to be an odd male, and odd female,
    Who (after some discussion and some doubt,
      If the soprano might be deemed to be male,
    They placed him o'er the women as a scout)
      Were linked together, and it happened the male
    Was Juan,--who, an awkward thing at his age,
    Paired off with a Bacchante blooming visage.

                      XCIII.

    With Raucocanti lucklessly was chained
      The tenor; these two hated with a hate
    Found only on the stage, and each more pained
      With this his tuneful neighbour than his fate;
    Sad strife arose, for they were so cross-grained,
      Instead of bearing up without debate,
    That each pulled different ways with many an oath,
    "Arcades ambo," _id est_--blackguards both.[eh]

                      XCIV.

    Juan's companion was a Romagnole,
      But bred within the march of old Ancona,
    With eyes that looked into the very soul
      (And other chief points of a _bella donna_),
    Bright--and as black and burning as a coal;
      And through her clear brunette complexion shone a
    Great wish to please--a most attractive dower,
    Especially when added to the power.

                      XCV.

    But all that power was wasted upon him,
      For Sorrow o'er each sense held stern command;
    Her eye might flash on his, but found it dim:
      And though thus chained, as natural her hand
    Touched his, nor that--nor any handsome limb
      (And she had some not easy to withstand)
    Could stir his pulse, or make his faith feel brittle;
    Perhaps his recent wounds might help a little.

                      XCVI.

    No matter; we should ne'er too much inquire,
      But facts are facts: no Knight could be more true,
    And firmer faith no Ladye-love desire;
      We will omit the proofs, save one or two:
    'T is said no one in hand "can hold a fire
      By thought of frosty Caucasus"[257]--but few,
    I really think--yet Juan's then ordeal
    Was more triumphant, and not much less real.

                      XCVII.

    Here I might enter on a chaste description,
      Having withstood temptation in my youth,[ei]
    But hear that several people take exception
      At the first two books having too much truth;
    Therefore I'll make Don Juan leave the ship soon,
      Because the publisher declares, in sooth,
    Through needles' eyes it easier for the camel is
    To pass, than those two cantos into families.

                      XCVIII.

    'T is all the same to me; I'm fond of yielding,
      And therefore leave them to the purer page
    Of Smollett, Prior, Ariosto, Fielding,
      Who say strange things for so correct an age;[258]
    I once had great alacrity in wielding
      My pen, and liked poetic war to wage,
    And recollect the time when all this cant
    Would have provoked remarks--which now it shan't.

                      XCIX.

    As boys love rows, my boyhood liked a squabble;
      But at this hour I wish to part in peace,
    Leaving such to the literary rabble;
      Whether my verse's fame be doomed to cease
    While the right hand which wrote it still is able,
      Or of some centuries to take a lease,
    The grass upon my grave will grow as long,
    And sigh to midnight winds, but not to song.

                      C.

    Of poets who come down to us through distance
      Of time and tongues, the foster-babes of Fame,
    Life seems the smallest portion of existence;
      Where twenty ages gather o'er a name,
    'T is as a snowball which derives assistance
      From every flake, and yet rolls on the same,
    Even till an iceberg it may chance to grow;
    But, after all, 't is nothing but cold snow.

                      CI.

    And so great names are nothing more than nominal,
      And love of Glory's but an airy lust,
    Too often in its fury overcoming all
      Who would as 't were identify their dust
    From out the wide destruction, which, entombing all,
      Leaves nothing till "the coming of the just"--
    Save change: I've stood upon Achilles' tomb,
    And heard Troy doubted;[259] Time will doubt of Rome.

                      CII.

    The very generations of the dead
      Are swept away, and tomb inherits tomb,
    Until the memory of an Age is fled,
      And, buried, sinks beneath its offspring's doom:
    Where are the epitaphs our fathers read?
      Save a few gleaned from the sepulchral gloom
    Which once-named myriads nameless lie beneath,
    And lose their own in universal Death.

                      CIII.

    I canter by the spot each afternoon
      Where perished in his fame the hero-boy,
    Who lived too long for men, but died too soon
      For human vanity, the young De Foix!
    A broken pillar, not uncouthly hewn,
      But which Neglect is hastening to destroy,
    Records Ravenna's carnage on its face,
    While weeds and ordure rankle round the base.[260]

                      CIV.

    I pass each day where Dante's bones are laid:[261]
      A little cupola, more neat than solemn,
    Protects his dust, but reverence here is paid[ej]
      To the Bard's tomb, and not the Warrior's column:
    The time must come, when both alike decayed,
      The Chieftain's trophy, and the Poet's volume,
    Will sink where lie the songs and wars of earth,
    Before Pelides' death, or Homer's birth.

                      CV.

    With human blood that column was cemented,
      With human filth that column is defiled,
    As if the peasant's coarse contempt were vented
      To show his loathing of the spot he soiled:[ek]
    Thus is the trophy used, and thus lamented
      Should ever be those blood-hounds, from whose wild
    Instinct of gore and glory Earth has known
    Those sufferings Dante saw in Hell alone.[el]

                      CVI.

    Yet there will still be bards: though Fame is smoke,
      Its fumes are frankincense to human thought;
    And the unquiet feelings, which first woke
      Song in the world, will seek what then they sought;[em]
    As on the beach the waves at last are broke,
      Thus to their extreme verge the passions brought
    Dash into poetry, which is but Passion,
    Or, at least, was so ere it grew a fashion.

                      CVII.

    If in the course of such a life as was
      At once adventurous and contemplative,
    Men who partake all passions as they pass,
      Acquire the deep and bitter power to give[en]
    Their images again as in a glass,
      And in such colours that they seem to live;
    You may do right forbidding them to show 'em,
    But spoil (I think) a very pretty poem.[262]

                      CVIII.

    Oh! ye, who make the fortunes of all books!
      Benign Ceruleans of the second sex!
    Who advertise new poems by your looks,
      Your "Imprimatur" will ye not annex?
    What! must I go to the oblivious cooks,[eo]
      Those Cornish plunderers of Parnassian wrecks?
    Ah! must I then the only minstrel be,
    Proscribed from tasting your Castalian tea![263]

                      CIX.

    What! can I prove "a lion" then no more?
      A ball-room bard, a foolscap, hot-press darling?
    To bear the compliments of many a bore,
      And sigh, "I can't get out," like Yorick's starling;[264]
    Why then I'll swear, as poet Wordy swore
      (Because the world won't read him, always snarling),
    That Taste is gone, that Fame is but a lottery,
    Drawn by the blue-coat misses of a coterie.[265]

                      CX.

    Oh! "darkly, deeply, beautifully blue,"[266]
      As some one somewhere sings about the sky,
    And I, ye learnéd ladies, say of you;
      They say your stockings are so--(Heaven knows why,
    I have examined few pair of that hue);
      Blue as the garters which serenely lie
    Round the Patrician left-legs, which adorn
    The festal midnight, and the levee morn.[ep]

                      CXI.

    Yet some of you are most seraphic creatures--
      But times are altered since, a rhyming lover,
    You read my stanzas, and I read your features:
      And--but no matter, all those things are over;
    Still I have no dislike to learnéd natures,
      For sometimes such a world of virtues cover;
    I knew one woman of that purple school,
    The loveliest, chastest, best, but--quite a fool.[267]

    Humboldt, "the first of travellers," but not
      The last, if late accounts be accurate,
    Invented, by some name I have forgot,
      As well as the sublime discovery's date,
    An airy instrument, with which he sought
      To ascertain the atmospheric state,
    By measuring "the _intensity of blue:_"[268]
    Oh, Lady Daphne! let me measure you![eq]

    But to the narrative:--The vessel bound
      With slaves to sell off in the capital,
    After the usual process, might be found
      At anchor under the seraglio wall;
    Her cargo, from the plague being safe and sound,
      Were landed in the market,[269] one and all;
    And, there, with Georgians, Russians, and Circassians,
    Bought up for different purposes and passions.

                      CXIV.

    Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
      For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,
    Warranted virgin; Beauty's brightest colours
      Had decked her out in all the hues of heaven:
    Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
      Who bade on till the hundreds reached eleven;
    But when the offer went beyond, they knew
    'T was for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.

                      CXV.

    Twelve negresses from Nubia brought a price
      Which the West Indian market scarce could bring--
    Though Wilberforce, at last, has made it twice
      What 't was ere Abolition; and the thing
    Need not seem very wonderful, for Vice
      Is always much more splendid than a King:
    The Virtues, even the most exalted, Charity,
    Are saving--Vice spares nothing for a rarity.

    But for the destiny of this young troop,
      How some were bought by Pachas, some by Jews,
    How some to burdens were obliged to stoop,
      And others rose to the command of crews
    As renegadoes; while in hapless group,
      Hoping no very old Vizier might choose,
    The females stood, as one by one they picked 'em,
    To make a mistress, or fourth wife, or victim:[er]

    All this must be reserved for further song;
      Also our Hero's lot, howe'er unpleasant

      Must be postponed discreetly for the present;
    I'm sensible redundancy is wrong,
      But could not for the Muse of me put less in 't:
    And now delay the progress of Don Juan,
    Till what is called in Ossian the fifth Duan.

eighty years, when "_Who would have thought the old man had so much
blood in him?_" (_Macbeth_, act v. sc. 1, lines 34-36.) Before I was
sixteen years of age I was witness to a melancholy instance of the same
effect of mixed passions upon a young person, who, however, did not die
in consequence, at that time, but fell a victim some years afterwards to
a seizure of the same kind, arising from causes intimately connected
with agitation of mind.

[251] This is a fact. A few years ago a man engaged a company for some

heard sing, by a strange coincidence, in Rossini's opera of _L'Italiana
in Algieri_, at Venice, in the beginning of 1817.

[We have reason to believe that the following, which we take from the
MS. journal of a highly respectable traveller, is a more correct
account: "In 1812 a Signor Guariglia induced several young persons of
both sexes--none of them exceeding fifteen years of age--to accompany
him on an operatic excursion; part to form the opera, and part the
ballet. He contrived to get them on board a vessel, which took them to
Janina, where he sold them for the basest purposes. Some died from the
effect of the climate, and some from suffering. Among the few who
returned were a Signor Molinari, and a female dancer named Bonfiglia,
who afterwards became the wife of Crespi, the tenor singer. The wretch
who so basely sold them was, when Lord Byron resided at Venice, employed
as _capo de' vestarj_, or head tailor, at the Fenice."--Maria Graham

[265] [In his _Essay, Supplement to the Preface_ (_Poems by William
Wordsworth_, ed. 1820, iii. 315-348), Wordsworth maintains that the
appreciation of great poetry is a plant of slow growth, that immediate
recognition is a mark of inferiority, or is to be accounted for by the
presence of adventitious qualities: "So strange, indeed, are the
obliquities of admiration, that they whose opinions are much influenced
by authority will often be tempted to think that there are no fixed
principles in human nature for this art to rest upon.... Away, then,
with the senseless iteration of the word _popular!_ ... The voice that
issues from this spirit [of human knowledge] is that _Vox Populi_ which
the Deity inspires. Foolish must he be who can mistake for this a local
acclamation, or a transitory outcry--transitory though it be for years,
local though from a Nation. Still more lamentable is his error who can
believe that there is anything of divine infallibility in this clamour
of that small though loud portion of the community ever governed by
factitious influence, which under the name of the PUBLIC, passes itself
upon the unthinking for the PEOPLE." Naturally enough Byron regarded
this pronouncement as a taunt if not as a challenge. Wordsworth's noble
appeal from a provincial to an imperial authority, from the present to
the future, is not strengthened by the obvious reference to the
popularity of contemporaries.]

    All feelings changed, but this was last to vary,
      A spell from which even yet I am not quite free:
    But I grow sad--and let a tale grow cold,
    Which must not be pathetically told.

                      V.

    The wind swept down the Euxine, and the wave
      Broke foaming o'er the blue Symplegades;
    'T is a grand sight from off "the Giant's Grave"[274]
      To watch the progress of those rolling seas
    Between the Bosphorus, as they lash and lave
      Europe and Asia, you being quite at ease:
    There's not a sea the passenger e'er pukes in,
    Turns up more dangerous breakers than the Euxine.

                      VI.

    'T was a raw day of Autumn's bleak beginning,
      When nights are equal, but not so the days;
    The Parcæ then cut short the further spinning
      Of seamen's fates, and the loud tempests raise[et]
    The waters, and repentance for past sinning
      In all, who o'er the great deep take their ways:
    They vow to amend their lives, and yet they don't;
    Because if drowned, they can't--if spared, they won't.

                      VII.

    A crowd of shivering slaves of every nation,
      And age, and sex, were in the market ranged;
    Each bevy with the merchant in his station:
      Poor creatures! their good looks were sadly changed.
    All save the blacks seemed jaded with vexation,
      From friends, and home, and freedom far estranged;
    The negroes more philosophy displayed,--
    Used to it, no doubt, as eels are to be flayed.

                      VIII.

    Juan was juvenile, and thus was full,
      As most at his age are, of hope, and health;
    Yet I must own, he looked a little dull,
      And now and then a tear stole down by stealth;
    Perhaps his recent loss of blood might pull
      His spirit down; and then the loss of wealth,
    A mistress, and such comfortable quarters,
    To be put up for auction amongst Tartars,

                      IX.

    Were things to shake a Stoic; ne'ertheless,
      Upon the whole his carriage was serene:
    His figure, and the splendour of his dress,
      Of which some gilded remnants still were seen,
    Drew all eyes on him, giving them to guess
      He was above the vulgar by his mien;
    And then, though pale, he was so very handsome;
    And then--they calculated on his ransom.[eu]

                      X.

    Like a backgammon board the place was dotted
      With whites and blacks, in groups on show for sale,
    Though rather more irregularly spotted:
      Some bought the jet, while others chose the pale.
    It chanced amongst the other people lotted,[ev]
      A man of thirty, rather stout and hale,
    With resolution in his dark grey eye,
    Next Juan stood, till some might choose to buy.

                      XI.

    He had an English look; that is, was square
      In make, of a complexion white and ruddy,
    Good teeth, with curling rather dark brown hair,
      And, it might be from thought, or toil, or study,
    An open brow a little marked with care:
      One arm had on a bandage rather bloody;
    And there he stood with such _sang froid,_ that greater
    Could scarce be shown even by a mere spectator.

                      XII.

    But seeing at his elbow a mere lad,
      Of a high spirit evidently, though
    At present weighed down by a doom which had
      O'erthrown even men, he soon began to show
    A kind of blunt compassion for the sad
      Lot of so young a partner in the woe,
    Which for himself he seemed to deem no worse
    Than any other scrape, a thing of course.

                      XIII.

    "My boy!"--said he, "amidst this motley crew
      Of Georgians, Russians, Nubians, and what not,
    All ragamuffins differing but in hue,
      With whom it is our luck to cast our lot,
    The only gentlemen seem I and you;
      So let us be acquainted, as we ought:
    If I could yield you any consolation,
    'T would give me pleasure.--Pray, what is your nation?"

                      XIV.

    When Juan answered--"Spanish!" he replied,
      "I thought, in fact, you could not be a Greek;
    Those servile dogs are not so proudly eyed:
      Fortune has played you here a pretty freak,
    But that's her way with all men, till they're tried;
      But never mind,--she'll turn, perhaps, next week;
    She has served me also much the same as you,
    Except that I have found it nothing new."

                      XV.

    "Pray, sir," said Juan, "if I may presume,
      _What_ brought you here?"--"Oh! nothing very rare--
    Six Tartars and a drag-chain----"--"To this doom
      But what conducted, if the question 's fair,
    Is that which I would learn."--"I served for some
      Months with the Russian army here and there;
    And taking lately, by Suwarrow's bidding,
    A town, was ta'en myself instead of Widdin."[275]

                      XVI.

    "Have you no friends?"--"I had--but, by God's blessing,
      Have not been troubled with them lately. Now
    I have answered all your questions without pressing,
      And you an equal courtesy should show."
    "Alas!" said Juan, "'t were a tale distressing,
      And long besides."--"Oh! if 't is really so,
    You're right on both accounts to hold your tongue;
    A sad tale saddens doubly when 't is long.

                      XVII.

    "But droop not: Fortune at your time of life,
      Although a female moderately fickle,
    Will hardly leave you (as she's not your wife)
      For any length of days in such a pickle.
    To strive, too, with our fate were such a strife
      As if the corn-sheaf should oppose the sickle:
    Men are the sport of circumstances, when
    The circumstances seem the sport of men."

                      XVIII.

    "'T is not," said Juan, "for my present doom
      I mourn, but for the past;--I loved a maid:"--
    He paused, and his dark eye grew full of gloom;
      A single tear upon his eyelash staid
    A moment, and then dropped; "but to resume,
      'Tis not my present lot, as I have said,
    Which I deplore so much; for I have borne
    Hardships which have the hardiest overworn,

                      XIX.

    "On the rough deep. But this last blow--" and here
      He stopped again, and turned away his face.
    "Aye," quoth his friend, "I thought it would appear
      That there had been a lady in the case;
    And these are things which ask a tender tear,
      Such as I, too, would shed if in your place:
    I cried upon my first wife's dying day,
    And also when my second ran away:

                      XX.

    "My third----"--"Your third!" quoth Juan, turning round;
      "You scarcely can be thirty: have you three?"
    "No--only two at present above ground:
      Surely 't is nothing wonderful to see
    One person thrice in holy wedlock bound!"
      "Well, then, your third," said Juan; "what did she?
    She did not run away, too,--did she, sir?"
    "No, faith."--"What then?"--"I ran away from her."

                      XXI.

    "You take things coolly, sir," said Juan. "Why,"
      Replied the other, "what can a man do?
    There still are many rainbows in your sky,
      But mine have vanished. All, when Life is new,
    Commence with feelings warm, and prospects high;
      But Time strips our illusions of their hue,
    And one by one in turn, some grand mistake
    Casts off its bright skin yearly like the snake.

                      XXII.

    "'T is true, it gets another bright and fresh,
      Or fresher, brighter; but the year gone through,
    This skin must go the way, too, of all flesh,
      Or sometimes only wear a week or two;--
    Love's the first net which spreads its deadly mesh;
      Ambition, Avarice, Vengeance, Glory, glue
    The glittering lime-twigs of our latter days,
    Where still we flutter on for pence or praise."

                      XXIII.

    "All this is very fine, and may be true,"
      Said Juan; "but I really don't see how
    It betters present times with me or you."
      "No?" quoth the other; "yet you will allow
    By setting things in their right point of view,
      Knowledge, at least, is gained; for instance, now,
    We know what slavery is, and our disasters
    May teach us better to behave when masters."

                      XXIV.

    "Would we were masters now, if but to try
      Their present lessons on our Pagan friends here,"
    Said Juan,--swallowing a heart-burning sigh:
      "Heaven help the scholar, whom his fortune sends here!"
    "Perhaps we shall be one day, by and by,"
      Rejoined the other, "when our bad luck mends here;
    Meantime (yon old black eunuch seems to eye us)
    I wish to G--d that somebody would buy us.

                      XXV.

    "But after all, what _is_ our present state?
      'T is bad, and may be better--all men's lot:
    Most men are slaves, none more so than the great,
      To their own whims and passions, and what not;
    Society itself, which should create
      Kindness, destroys what little we had got:
    To feel for none is the true social art
    Of the world's Stoics--men without a heart."

                      XXVI.

    Just now a black old neutral personage
      Of the third sex stepped up, and peering over
    The captives seemed to mark their looks and age,
      And capabilities, as to discover
    If they were fitted for the purposed cage:
      No lady e'er is ogled by a lover,
    Horse by a blackleg, broadcloth by a tailor,
    Fee by a counsel, felon by a jailor,

                      XXVII.

    As is a slave by his intended bidder.
      'T is pleasant purchasing our fellow-creatures;
    And all are to be sold, if you consider
      Their passions, and are dext'rous; some by features
    Are bought up, others by a warlike leader,
      Some by a place--as tend their years or natures:
    The most by ready cash--but all have prices,
    From crowns to kicks, according to their vices.

                      XXVIII.

    The eunuch, having eyed them o'er with care,
      Turned to the merchant, and began to bid
    First but for one, and after for the pair;
      They haggled, wrangled, swore, too--so they did!
    As though they were in a mere Christian fair,
      Cheapening an ox, an ass, a lamb, or kid;
    So that their bargain sounded like a battle
    For this superior yoke of human cattle.

                      XXIX.

    At last they settled into simple grumbling,
      And pulling out reluctant purses, and
    Turning each piece of silver o'er, and tumbling
      Some down, and weighing others in their hand,
    And by mistake sequins[276] with paras jumbling,
      Until the sum was accurately scanned,
    And then the merchant giving change, and signing
    Receipts in full, began to think of dining.

                      XXX.

    I wonder if his appetite was good?
      Or, if it were, if also his digestion?
    Methinks at meals some odd thoughts might intrude,
      And Conscience ask a curious sort of question,
    About the right divine how far we should
      Sell flesh and blood. When dinner has oppressed one,
    I think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour
    Which turns up out of the sad twenty-four.

                      XXXI.

    Voltaire says "No:" he tells you that Candide
      Found life most tolerable after meals;[277]
    He's wrong--unless man were a pig, indeed,
      Repletion rather adds to what he feels,
    Unless he's drunk, and then no doubt he's freed
      From his own brain's oppression while it reels.
    Of food I think with Philip's son[278] or rather
    Ammon's (ill pleased with one world and one father);[ew]

                      XXXII.

    I think with Alexander, that the act
      Of eating, with another act or two,
    Makes us feel our mortality in fact
      Redoubled; when a roast and a ragout,
    And fish, and soup, by some side dishes backed,
      Can give us either pain or pleasure, who
    Would pique himself on intellects, whose use
    Depends so much upon the gastric juice?

                      XXXIII.

    The other evening ('t was on Friday last)--
      This is a fact, and no poetic fable--
    Just as my great coat was about me cast,
      My hat and gloves still lying on the table,
    I heard a shot--'t was eight o'clock scarce past--
      And, running out as fast as I was able,[279]
    I found the military commandant
    Stretched in the street, and able scarce to pant.

                      XXXIV.

    Poor fellow! for some reason, surely bad,
      They had slain him with five slugs; and left him there
    To perish on the pavement: so I had
      Him borne into the house and up the stair,
    And stripped, and looked to[ex]----But why should I add
      More circumstances? vain was every care;
    The man was gone--in some Italian quarrel
    Killed by five bullets from an old gun-barrel.

                      XXXV.

    I gazed upon him, for I knew him well;
      And though I have seen many corpses, never
    Saw one, whom such an accident befell,
      So calm; though pierced through stomach, heart, and liver,
    He seemed to sleep,--for you could scarcely tell
      (As he bled inwardly, no hideous river
    Of gore divulged the cause) that he was dead:
    So as I gazed on him, I thought or said--

                      XXXVI.

    "Can this be Death? then what is Life or Death?
      Speak!" but he spoke not: "wake!" but still he slept:--
    "But yesterday and who had mightier breath?
      A thousand warriors by his word were kept
    In awe: he said, as the Centurion saith,
      'Go,' and he goeth; 'come,' and forth he stepped.
    The trump and bugle till he spake were dumb--
    And now nought left him but the muffled drum."[ey]

                      XXXVII.

    And they who waited once and worshipped--they
      With their rough faces thronged about the bed
    To gaze once more on the commanding clay
      Which for the last, though not the first, time bled;
    And such an end! that he who many a day
      Had faced Napoleon's foes until they fled,--
    The foremost in the charge or in the sally,
    Should now be butchered in a civic alley.

                      XXXVIII.

    The scars of his old wounds were near his new,
      Those honourable scars which brought him fame;
    And horrid was the contrast to the view----
      But let me quit the theme; as such things claim
    Perhaps even more attention than is due
      From me: I gazed (as oft I have gazed the same)
    To try if I could wrench aught out of Death
    Which should confirm, or shake, or make a faith;

                      XXXIX.

    But it was all a mystery. Here we are,
      And there we go:--but _where_? five bits of lead,
    Or three, or two, or one, send very far!
      And is this blood, then, formed but to be shed?
    Can every element our elements mar?
      And Air--Earth--Water--Fire live--and we dead?
    _We_, whose minds comprehend all things? No more;
    But let us to the story as before.

                      XL.

    The purchaser of Juan and acquaintance
      Bore off his bargains to a gilded boat,
    Embarked himself and them, and off they went thence
      As fast as oars could pull and water float;
    They looked like persons being led to sentence,
      Wondering what next, till the caique[280] was brought
    Up in a little creek below a wall
    O'ertopped with cypresses, dark-green and tall.

                      XLI.

    Here their conductor tapping at the wicket
      Of a small iron door, 't was opened, and
    He led them onward, first through a low thicket
      Flanked by large groves, which towered on either hand:
    They almost lost their way, and had to pick it--
      For night was closing ere they came to land.
    The eunuch made a sign to those on board,
    Who rowed off, leaving them without a word.

                      XLII.

    As they were plodding on their winding way
      Through orange bowers, and jasmine, and so forth:
    (Of which I might have a good deal to say,
      There being no such profusion in the North
    Of oriental plants, _et cetera_,
      But that of late your scribblers think it worth
    Their while to rear whole hotbeds in _their_ works,
    Because _one_ poet travelled 'mongst the Turks:)[281]

                      XLIII.

    As they were threading on their way, there came
      Into Don Juan's head a thought, which he
    Whispered to his companion:--'t was the same
      Which might have then occurred to you or me.
    "Methinks,"--said he,--"it would be no great shame
      If we should strike a stroke to set us free;
    Let's knock that old black fellow on the head,
    And march away--'t were easier done than said."

                      XLIV.

    "Yes," said the other, "and when done, what then?
      _How_ get out? how the devil got we in?
    And when we once were fairly out, and when
      From Saint Bartholomew we have saved our skin,[282][ez]
    To-morrow'd see us in some other den,
      And worse off than we hitherto have been;
    Besides, I'm hungry, and just now would take,
    Like Esau, for my birthright a beef-steak.

                      XLV.

    "We must be near some place of man's abode;--
      For the old negro's confidence in creeping,
    With his two captives, by so queer a road,
      Shows that he thinks his friends have not been sleeping;
    A single cry would bring them all abroad:
      'T is better therefore looking before leaping--
    And there, you see, this turn has brought us through,
    By Jove, a noble palace!--lighted too."

                      XLVI.

    It was indeed a wide extensive building
      Which opened on their view, and o'er the front
    There seemed to be besprent a deal of gilding
      And various hues, as is the Turkish wont,--
    A gaudy taste; for they are little skilled in
      The arts of which these lands were once the font:
    Each villa on the Bosphorus looks a screen
    New painted, or a pretty opera-scene.[283]

                      XLVII.

    And nearer as they came, a genial savour
      Of certain stews, and roast-meats, and pilaus,
    Things which in hungry mortals' eyes find favour,
      Made Juan in his harsh intentions pause,
    And put himself upon his good behaviour:
      His friend, too, adding a new saving clause,
    Said, "In Heaven's name let's get some supper now,
    And then I'm with you, if you're for a row."

                      XLVIII.

    Some talk of an appeal unto some passion,
      Some to men's feelings, others to their reason;
    The last of these was never much the fashion,
      For Reason thinks all reasoning out of season:
    Some speakers whine, and others lay the lash on,
      But more or less continue still to tease on,
    With arguments according to their "forte:"
    But no one ever dreams of being short.--

                      XLIX.

    But I digress: of all appeals,--although
      I grant the power of pathos, and of gold,
    Of beauty, flattery, threats, a shilling,--no
      Method's more sure at moments to take hold[fa]
    Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow
      More tender, as we every day behold,
    Than that all-softening, overpowering knell,
    The Tocsin of the Soul--the dinner-bell.

                      L.

    Turkey contains no bells, and yet men dine;
      And Juan and his friend, albeit they heard
    No Christian knoll to table, saw no line
      Of lackeys usher to the feast prepared,
    Yet smelt roast-meat, beheld a huge fire shine,
      And cooks in motion with their clean arms bared,
    And gazed around them to the left and right,
    With the prophetic eye of appetite.

                      LI.

    And giving up all notions of resistance,
      They followed close behind their sable guide,
    Who little thought that his own cracked existence
      Was on the point of being set aside:
    He motioned them to stop at some small distance,
      And knocking at the gate, 't was opened wide,
    And a magnificent large hall displayed
    The Asian pomp of Ottoman parade.

                      LII.

    I won't describe; description is my "forte,"
      But every fool describes in these bright days
    His wondrous journey to some foreign court,
      And spawns his quarto, and demands your praise--
    Death to his publisher, to him 't is sport;
      While Nature, tortured twenty thousand ways,
    Resigns herself with exemplary patience
    To guide-books, rhymes, tours, sketches, illustrations.[284]

                      LIII.

    Along this hall, and up and down, some, squatted
      Upon their hams, were occupied at chess;
    Others in monosyllable talk chatted,
      And some seemed much in love with their own dress;
    And divers smoked superb pipes decorated
      With amber mouths of greater price or less;
    And several strutted, others slept, and some
    Prepared for supper with a glass of rum.[285]

                      LIV.

    As the black eunuch entered with his brace
      Of purchased Infidels, some raised their eyes
    A moment, without slackening from their pace;
      But those who sate ne'er stirred in any wise:
    One or two stared the captives in the face,
      Just as one views a horse to guess his price;
    Some nodded to the negro from their station,
    But no one troubled him with conversation.[286]

                      LV.

    He leads them through the hall, and, without stopping,
      On through a farther range of goodly rooms,
    Splendid, but silent, save in _one_, where dropping[287]
      A marble fountain echoes through the glooms
    Of night which robe the chamber, or where popping
      Some female head most curiously presumes
    To thrust its black eyes through the door or lattice,
    As wondering what the _devil_ noise that is!

                      LVI.

    Some faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls
      Gave light enough to hint their farther way,
    But not enough to show the imperial halls
      In all the flashing of their full array;
    Perhaps there's nothing--I'll not say appals,
      But saddens more by night as well as day,
    Than an enormous room without a soul[288]
    To break the lifeless splendour of the whole.

                      LVII.

    Two or three seem so little, _one_ seems nothing:
      In deserts, forests, crowds, or by the shore,
    _There_ Solitude, we know, has her full growth in
      The spots which were her realms for evermore;
    But in a mighty hall or gallery, both in
      More modern buildings and those built of yore,
    A kind of Death comes o'er us all alone,
    Seeing what's meant for many with but one.

                      LVIII.

    A neat, snug study on a winter's night,[fb]
      A book, friend, single lady, or a glass
    Of claret, sandwich, and an appetite,
      Are things which make an English evening pass--
    Though _certes_ by no means so grand a sight
      As is a theatre lit up by gas--
    _I_ pass my evenings in long galleries solely,[fc][289]
    And that's the reason I'm so melancholy.

                      LIX.

    Alas! Man makes that great which makes him little--
      I grant you in a church 't is very well:
    What speaks of Heaven should by no means be brittle,
      But strong and lasting, till no tongue can tell
    Their names who reared it; but huge houses fit ill,
      And huge tombs, worse, Mankind--since Adam fell:
    Methinks the story of the tower of Babel
    Might teach them this much better than I'm able.

                      LX.

    Babel was Nimrod's hunting-box, and then
      A town of gardens, walls, and wealth amazing,
    Where Nabuchadonosor,[290] King of men,
      Reigned, till one summer's day he took to grazing,
    And Daniel tamed the lions in their den,
      The people's awe and admiration raising;
    'T was famous, too, for Thisbe and for Pyramus,[291]
    And the calumniated queen Semiramis--

                      LXI.

    That injured Queen, by chroniclers[292] so coarse,
      Has been accused (I doubt not by conspiracy)
    Of an improper friendship for her horse
      (Love, like Religion, sometimes runs to heresy):
    This monstrous tale had probably its source
      (For such exaggerations here and there I see)
    In writing "Courser" by mistake for "Courier:"[fd]
    I wish the case could come before a jury here.[293]

                      LXII.

    But to resume,--should there be (what may not
      Be in these days?) some infidels, who don't,
    Because they can't find out the very spot
      Of that same Babel, or because they won't
    (Though Claudius Rich, Esquire, some bricks has got,
      And written lately two memoirs upon't),[294]
    Believe the Jews, those unbelievers, who
    Must be believed, though they believe not you:

                      LXIII.

    Yet let them think that Horace has expressed
      Shortly and sweetly the masonic folly
    Of those, forgetting the great place of rest,
      Who give themselves to Architecture wholly;
    We know where things and men must end at best:
      A moral (like all morals) melancholy,
    And "Et sepulchri immemor struis domos"
    Shows that we build when we should but entomb us.

                      LXIV.

    At last they reached a quarter most retired,
      Where Echo woke as if from a long slumber;
    Though full of all things which could be desired,
      One wondered what to do with such a number
    Of articles which nobody required;
      Here Wealth had done its utmost to encumber
    With furniture an exquisite apartment,
    Which puzzled Nature much to know what Art meant.

                      LXV.

    It seemed, however, but to open on
      A range or suite of further chambers, which
    Might lead to Heaven knows where; but in this one
      The moveables were prodigally rich:
    Sofas 't was half a sin to sit upon,
      So costly were they; carpets every stitch
    Of workmanship so rare, they made you wish
    You could glide o'er them like a golden fish.

                      LXVI.

    The black, however, without hardly deigning
      A glance at that which wrapped the slaves in wonder,
    Trampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining,
      As if the milky way their feet was under
    With all its stars; and with a stretch attaining
      A certain press or cupboard niched in yonder,
    In that remote recess which you may see--
    Or if you don't the fault is not in me,--

                      LXVII.

    I wish to be perspicuous--and the black,
      I say, unlocking the recess, pulled forth
    A quantity of clothes fit for the back
      Of any Mussulman, whate'er his worth:
    And of variety there was no lack--
      And yet, though I have said there was no dearth,--
    He chose himself to point out what he thought
    Most proper for the Christians he had bought.

                      LXVIII.

    The suit he thought most suitable to each
      Was, for the elder and the stouter, first
    A Candiote cloak, which to the knee might reach,
      And trousers not so tight that they would burst,
    But such as fit an Asiatic breech;
      A shawl, whose folds in Cashmire had been nursed,
    Slippers of saffron, dagger rich and handy;
    In short, all things which form a Turkish Dandy.

                      LXIX.

    While he was dressing, Baba, their black friend,
      Hinted the vast advantages which they
    Might probably attain both in the end,
      If they would but pursue the proper way
    Which Fortune plainly seemed to recommend;
      And then he added, that he needs must say,
    "'T would greatly tend to better their condition,
    If they would condescend to circumcision.

                      LXX.

    "For his own part, he really should rejoice
      To see them true believers, but no less
    Would leave his proposition to their choice."
      The other, thanking him for this excess
    Of goodness, in thus leaving them a voice
      In such a trifle, scarcely could express
    "Sufficiently" (he said) "his approbation
    Of all the customs of this polished nation.

                      LXXI.

    "For his own share--he saw but small objection
      To so respectable an ancient rite;
    And, after swallowing down a slight refection,
      For which he owned a present appetite,
    He doubted not a few hours of reflection
      Would reconcile him to the business quite."
    "Will it?" said Juan, sharply: "Strike me dead,
    But they as soon shall circumcise my head![fe]

                      LXXII.

    "Cut off a thousand heads, before----"--"Now, pray,"
      Replied the other, "do not interrupt:
    You put me out in what I had to say.
      Sir!--as I said, as soon as I have supped,
    I shall perpend if your proposal may
      Be such as I can properly accept;
    Provided always your great goodness still
    Remits the matter to our own free-will."

                      LXXIII.

    Baba eyed Juan, and said, "Be so good
      As dress yourself--" and pointed out a suit
    In which a Princess with great pleasure would
      Array her limbs; but Juan standing mute,
    As not being in a masquerading mood,
      Gave it a slight kick with his Christian foot;
    And when the old negro told him to "Get ready,"
    Replied, "Old gentleman, I'm not a lady."

                      LXXIV.

    "What you may be, I neither know nor care,"
      Said Baba; "but pray do as I desire:
    I have no more time nor many words to spare."
      "At least," said Juan, "sure I may inquire
    The cause of this odd travesty?"--"Forbear,"
      Said Baba, "to be curious; 't will transpire,
    No doubt, in proper place, and time, and season:
    I have no authority to tell the reason."

                      LXXV.

    "Then if I do," said Juan, "I'll be----"--"Hold!"
      Rejoined the negro, "pray be not provoking;
    This spirit's well, but it may wax too bold,
      And you will find us not too fond of joking."
    "What, sir!" said Juan, "shall it e'er be told
      That I unsexed my dress?" But Baba, stroking
    The things down, said, "Incense me, and I call
    Those who will leave you of no sex at all.

                      LXXVI.

    "I offer you a handsome suit of clothes:
      A woman's, true; but then there is a cause
    Why you should wear them."--"What, though my soul loathes
      The effeminate garb?"--thus, after a short pause,
    Sighed Juan, muttering also some slight oaths,
      "What the devil shall I do with all this gauze?"
    Thus he profanely termed the finest lace
    Which e'er set off a marriage-morning face.

                      LXXVII.

    And then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipped
      A pair of trousers of flesh-coloured silk;[ff]
    Next with a virgin zone he was equipped,
      Which girt a slight chemise as white as milk;
    But tugging on his petticoat, he tripped,
      Which--as we say--or as the Scotch say, _whilk_.[295]
    (The rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes
    Monarchs are less imperative than rhymes)--[fg]

                      LXXVIII.

    Whilk, which (or what you please), was owing to
      His garment's novelty, and his being awkward:
    And yet at last he managed to get through
      His toilet, though no doubt a little backward:
    The negro Baba helped a little too,
      When some untoward part of raiment stuck hard;
    And, wrestling both his arms into a gown,
    He paused, and took a survey up and down.

                      LXXIX.

    One difficulty still remained--his hair
      Was hardly long enough; but Baba found
    So many false long tresses all to spare,
      That soon his head was most completely crowned,
    After the manner then in fashion there;
      And this addition with such gems was bound
    As suited the _ensemble_ of his toilet,
    While Baba made him comb his head and oil it.

                      LXXX.

    And now being femininely all arrayed,
      With some small aid from scissors, paint, and tweezers,
    He looked in almost all respects a maid,[fh]
      And Baba smilingly exclaimed, "You see, sirs,
    A perfect transformation here displayed;
      And now, then, you must come along with me, sirs,
    That is--the Lady:" clapping his hands twice,
    Four blacks were at his elbow in a trice.

                      LXXXI.

    "You, sir," said Baba, nodding to the one,
      "Will please to accompany those gentlemen
    To supper; but you, worthy Christian nun,
      Will follow me: no trifling, sir; for when
    I say a thing, it must at once be done.
      What fear you? think you this a lion's den?
    Why, 't is a palace; where the truly wise
    Anticipate the Prophet's paradise.

                      LXXXII.

    "You fool! I tell you no one means you harm."
      "So much the better," Juan said, "for them;
    Else they shall feel the weight of this my arm,
      Which is not quite so light as you may deem.
    I yield thus far; but soon will break the charm,
      If any take me for that which I seem:
    So that I trust for every body's sake,
    That this disguise may lead to no mistake."

                      LXXXIII.

    "Blockhead! come on, and see," quoth Baba; while
      Don Juan, turning to his comrade, who
    Though somewhat grieved, could scarce forbear a smile
      Upon the metamorphosis in view,--
    "Farewell!" they mutually exclaimed: "this soil
      Seems fertile in adventures strange and new;
    One's turned half Mussulman, and one a maid,
    By this old black enchanter's unsought aid."

                      LXXXIV.

    "Farewell!" said Juan: "should we meet no more,
      I wish you a good appetite."--"Farewell!"
    Replied the other; "though it grieves me sore:
      When we next meet, we'll have a tale to tell:
    We needs must follow when Fate puts from shore.
      Keep your good name; though Eve herself once fell."
    "Nay," quoth the maid, "the Sultan's self shan't carry me,
    Unless his Highness promises to marry me."

                      LXXXV.

    And thus they parted, each by separate doors;
      Baba led Juan onward, room by room,
    Through glittering galleries, and o'er marble floors,
      Till a gigantic portal through the gloom,
    Haughty and huge, along the distance lowers;
      And wafted far arose a rich perfume:
    It seemed as though they came upon a shrine,
    For all was vast, still, fragrant, and divine.

                      LXXXVI.

    The giant door was broad, and bright, and high,
      Of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise;
    Warriors thereon were battling furiously;
      Here stalks the victor, there the vanquished lies;
    There captives led in triumph droop the eye,
      And in perspective many a squadron flies:
    It seems the work of times before the line
    Of Rome transplanted fell with Constantine.

                      LXXXVII.

    This massy portal stood at the wide close
      Of a huge hall, and on its either side
    Two little dwarfs, the least you could suppose,
      Were sate, like ugly imps, as if allied
    In mockery to the enormous gate which rose
      O'er them in almost pyramidic pride:
    The gate so splendid was in all its _features_,[296]
    You never thought about those little creatures,

                      LXXXVIII.

    Until you nearly trod on them, and then
      You started back in horror to survey
    The wondrous hideousness of those small men,
      Whose colour was not black, nor white, nor grey,
    But an extraneous mixture, which no pen
      Can trace, although perhaps the pencil may;
    They were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb--
    Monsters, who cost a no less monstrous sum.

                      LXXXIX.

    Their duty was--for they were strong, and though
      They looked so little, did strong things at times--
    To ope this door, which they could really do,
      The hinges being as smooth as Rogers' rhymes;
    And now and then, with tough strings of the bow,
      As is the custom of those Eastern climes,
    To give some rebel Pacha a cravat--
    For mutes are generally used for that.

                      XC.

    They spoke by signs--that is, not spoke at all;
      And looking like two Incubi, they glared
    As Baba with his fingers made them fall
      To heaving back the portal folds: it scared
    Juan a moment, as this pair so small,
      With shrinking serpent optics on him stared;[297]
    It was as if their little looks could poison
    Or fascinate whome'er they fixed their eyes on.

                      XCI.

    Before they entered, Baba paused to hint
      To Juan some slight lessons as his guide:
    "If you could just contrive," he said, "to stint
      That somewhat manly majesty of stride,
    'T would be as well, and--(though there's not much in 't)
      To swing a little less from side to side,
    Which has at times an aspect of the oddest;--
    And also could you look a little modest,

                      XCII.

    "'T would be convenient; for these mutes have eyes
      Like needles, which may pierce those petticoats;
    And if they should discover your disguise,
      You know how near us the deep Bosphorus floats;
    And you and I may chance, ere morning rise,
      To find our way to Marmora without boats,
    Stitched up in sacks--a mode of navigation
    A good deal practised here upon occasion."[298]

                      XCIII.

    With this encouragement he led the way
      Into a room still nobler than the last;
    A rich confusion formed a disarray
      In such sort, that the eye along it cast
    Could hardly carry anything away,
      Object on object flashed so bright and fast;
    A dazzling mass of gems, and gold, and glitter,
    Magnificently mingled in a litter.

                      XCIV.

    Wealth had done wonders--taste not much; such things
      Occur in Orient palaces, and even
    In the more chastened domes of Western kings
      (Of which I have also seen some six or seven),
    Where I can't say or gold or diamond flings
      Great lustre, there is much to be forgiven;
    Groups of bad statues, tables, chairs, and pictures,
    On which I cannot pause to make my strictures.

                      XCV.

    In this imperial hall, at distance lay
      Under a canopy, and there reclined
    Quite in a confidential queenly way,
      A lady; Baba stopped, and kneeling signed
    To Juan, who though not much used to pray,
      Knelt down by instinct, wondering in his mind
    What all this meant: while Baba bowed and bended
    His head, until the ceremony ended.

                      XCVI.

    The lady rising up with such an air
      As Venus rose with from the wave, on them
    Bent like an antelope a Paphian pair[fi]
      Of eyes, which put out each surrounding gem;
    And raising up an arm as moonlight fair,
      She signed to Baba, who first kissed the hem
    Of her deep purple robe, and, speaking low,
    Pointed to Juan who remained below.

                      XCVII.

    Her presence was as lofty as her state;
      Her beauty of that overpowering kind,
    Whose force Description only would abate:
      I'd rather leave it much to your own mind,
    Than lessen it by what I could relate
      Of forms and features; it would strike you blind
    Could I do justice to the full detail;
    So, luckily for both, my phrases fail.

                      XCVIII.

    Thus much however I may add,--her years
      Were ripe, they might make six-and-twenty springs,
    But there are forms which Time to touch forbears,
      And turns aside his scythe to vulgar things:[fj]
    Such as was Mary's, Queen of Scots; true--tears
      And Love destroy; and sapping Sorrow wrings
    Charms from the charmer, yet some never grow
    Ugly; for instance--Ninon de l'Enclos.[299]

                      XCIX.

    She spake some words to her attendants, who
      Composed a choir of girls, ten or a dozen,
    And were all clad alike; like Juan, too,
      Who wore their uniform, by Baba chosen:
    They formed a very nymph-like looking crew,[300]
      Which might have called Diana's chorus "cousin,"
    As far as outward show may correspond--
    I won't be bail for anything beyond.

                      C.

    They bowed obeisance and withdrew, retiring,
      But not by the same door through which came in
    Baba and Juan, which last stood admiring,
      At some small distance, all he saw within
    This strange saloon, much fitted for inspiring
      Marvel and praise; for both or none things win;
    And I must say, I ne'er could see the very
    Great happiness of the "Nil admirari."[301]

                      CI.

    "Not to admire is all the art I know
      (Plain truth, dear Murray, needs few flowers of speech)--
    To make men happy, or to keep them so"
      (So take it in the very words of Creech)--
    Thus Horace wrote we all know long ago;
      And thus Pope[302] quotes the precept to re-teach
    From his translation; but had _none admired_,
    Would Pope have sung, or Horace been inspired?[303]

                      CII.

    Baba, when all the damsels were withdrawn,
      Motioned to Juan to approach, and then
    A second time desired him to kneel down,
      And kiss the lady's foot; which maxim when
    He heard repeated, Juan with a frown
      Drew himself up to his full height again,
    And said, "It grieved him, but he could not stoop
    To any shoe, unless it shod the Pope."

                      CII.

    Baba, indignant at this ill-timed pride,
      Made fierce remonstrances, and then a threat
    He muttered (but the last was given aside)
      About a bow-string--quite in vain; not yet
    Would Juan bend, though 't were to Mahomet's bride:
      There's nothing in the world like _etiquette_
    In kingly chambers or imperial halls,
    As also at the Race and County Balls.

                      CIV.

    He stood like Atlas, with a world of words
      About his ears, and nathless would not bend;
    The blood of all his line's Castilian lords
      Boiled in his veins, and, rather than descend
    To stain his pedigree, a thousand swords
      A thousand times of him had made an end;
    At length perceiving the "_foot_" could not stand,
    Baba proposed that he should kiss the hand,

                      CV.

    Here was an honourable compromise,
      A half-way house of diplomatic rest,
    Where they might meet in much more peaceful guise;
      And Juan now his willingness expressed
    To use all fit and proper courtesies,
      Adding, that this was commonest and best,
    For through the South, the custom still commands
    The gentleman to kiss the lady's hands.

                      CVI.

    And he advanced, though with but a bad grace,
      Though on more _thorough-bred_[304] or fairer fingers
    No lips e'er left their transitory trace:
      On such as these the lip too fondly lingers,
    And for one kiss would fain imprint a brace,
      As you will see, if she you love shall bring hers
    In contact; and sometimes even a fair stranger's
    An almost twelvemonth's constancy endangers.

                      CVII.

    The lady eyed him o'er and o'er, and bade
      Baba retire, which he obeyed in style,
    As if well used to the retreating trade;
      And taking hints in good part all the while,
    He whispered Juan not to be afraid,
      And looking on him with a sort of smile,
    Took leave, with such a face of satisfaction,
    As good men wear who have done a virtuous action.

                      CVIII.

    When he was gone, there was a sudden change:
      I know not what might be the lady's thought,
    But o'er her bright brow flashed a tumult strange,
      And into her clear cheek the blood was brought,
    Blood-red as sunset summer clouds which range
      The verge of Heaven; and in her large eyes wrought,
    A mixture of sensations might be scanned,
    Of half voluptuousness and half command.

                      CIX.

    Her form had all the softness of her sex,
      Her features all the sweetness of the Devil,
    When he put on the Cherub to perplex[305]
      Eve, and paved (God knows how) the road to evil;
    The Sun himself was scarce more free from specks
      Than she from aught at which the eye could cavil;
    Yet, somehow, there was something somewhere wanting,
    As if she rather _ordered_ than was _granting_.--

                      CX.

    Something imperial, or imperious, threw
      A chain o'er all she did; that is, a chain
    Was thrown as 't were about the neck of you,--
      And Rapture's self will seem almost a pain
    With aught which looks like despotism in view;
      Our souls at least are free, and 't is in vain
    We would against them make the flesh obey--
    The spirit in the end will have its way.

                      CXI.

    Her very smile was haughty, though so sweet;
      Her very nod was not an inclination;
    There was a self-will even in her small feet,
      As though they were quite conscious of her station--
    They trod as upon necks; and to complete
      Her state (it is the custom of her nation),
    A poniard decked her girdle, as the sign
    She was a Sultan's bride (thank Heaven, not mine!).

                      CXII.

    "To hear and to obey" had been from birth
      The law of all around her; to fulfil
    All phantasies which yielded joy or mirth,
      Had been her slaves' chief pleasure, as her will;
    Her blood was high, her beauty scarce of earth:
      Judge, then, if her caprices e'er stood still;
    Had she but been a Christian, I've a notion
    We should have found out the "perpetual motion."

                      CXIII.

    Whate'er she saw and coveted was brought;
      Whate'er she did _not_ see, if she supposed
    It might be seen, with diligence was sought,
      And when 't was found straightway the bargain closed:
    There was no end unto the things she bought,
      Nor to the trouble which her fancies caused;
    Yet even her tyranny had such a grace,
    The women pardoned all except her face.[fk]

                      CXIV.

    Juan, the latest of her whims, had caught
      Her eye in passing on his way to sale;
    She ordered him directly to be bought,
      And Baba, who had ne'er been known to fail
    In any kind of mischief to be wrought,
      At all such auctions knew how to prevail:[fl]
    She had no prudence, but he had--and this
    Explains the garb which Juan took amiss.

                      CXV.

    His youth and features favoured the disguise,
      And should you ask how she, a Sultan's bride,
    Could risk or compass such strange phantasies,
      This I must leave sultanas to decide:
    Emperors are only husbands in wives' eyes,
      And kings and consorts oft are mystified,[fm]
    As we may ascertain with due precision,
    Some by experience, others by tradition.

                      CXVI.

    But to the main point, where we have been tending:--
      She now conceived all difficulties past,
    And deemed herself extremely condescending
      When, being made her property at last,
    Without more preface, in her blue eyes blending
      Passion and power, a glance on him she cast,
    And merely saying, "Christian, canst thou love?"
    Conceived that phrase was quite enough to move.

                      CXVII.

    And so it was, in proper time and place;
      But Juan, who had still his mind o'erflowing
    With Haidée's isle and soft Ionian face,
      Felt the warm blood, which in his face was glowing
    Rush back upon his heart, which filled apace,
      And left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing:
    These words went through his soul like Arab spears,[306]
    So that he spoke not, but burst into tears.

                      CXVIII.

    She was a good deal shocked; not shocked at tears,
      For women shed and use them at their liking;
    But there is something when man's eye appears
      Wet, still more disagreeable and striking:
    A woman's tear-drop melts, a man's half sears,
      Like molten lead, as if you thrust a pike in
    His heart to force it out, for (to be shorter)
    To them 't is a relief, to us a torture.

                      CXIX.

    And she would have consoled, but knew not how:
      Having no equals, nothing which had e'er
    Infected her with sympathy till now,
      And never having dreamt what 't was to bear
    Aught of a serious, sorrowing kind, although
      There might arise some pouting petty care
    To cross her brow, she wondered how so near
    Her eyes another's eye could shed a tear.

                      CXX.

    But Nature teaches more than power can spoil,[fn]
      And, when a strong although a strange sensation
    Moves--female hearts are such a genial soil
      For kinder feelings, whatso'er their nation,
    They naturally pour the "wine and oil,"
      Samaritans in every situation;
    And thus Gulbeyaz, though she knew not why,
    Felt an odd glistening moisture in her eye.

                      CXXI.

    But tears must stop like all things else; and soon
      Juan, who for an instant had been moved
    To such a sorrow by the intrusive tone
      Of one who dared to ask if "he _had_ loved,"
    Called back the Stoic to his eyes, which shone
      Bright with the very weakness he reproved;
    And although sensitive to beauty, he
    Felt most indignant still at not being free.

                      CXXII.

    Gulbeyaz, for the first time in her days,
      Was much embarrassed, never having met
    In all her life with aught save prayers and praise;
      And as she also risked her life to get
    Him whom she meant to tutor in love's ways
      Into a comfortable tête-à-tête,
    To lose the hour would make her quite a martyr,
    And they had wasted now almost a quarter.

                      CXXIII.

    I also would suggest the fitting time
      To gentlemen in any such like case,
    That is to say in a meridian clime--
      With us there is more law given to the chase,
    But here a small delay forms a great crime:
      So recollect that the extremest grace
    Is just two minutes for your declaration--
    A moment more would hurt your reputation.

                      CXXIV.

    Juan's was good; and might have been still better,
      But he had got Haidée into his head:
    However strange, he could not yet forget her,
      Which made him seem exceedingly ill-bred.
    Gulbeyaz, who looked on him as her debtor
      For having had him to her palace led,
    Began to blush up to the eyes, and then
    Grow deadly pale, and then blush back again.

                      CXXV.

    At length, in an imperial way, she laid
      Her hand on his, and bending on him eyes
    Which needed not an empire to persuade,
      Looked into his for love, where none replies:
    Her brow grew black, but she would not upbraid,
      That being the last thing a proud woman tries;
    She rose, and pausing one chaste moment threw
    Herself upon his breast, and there she grew.

                      CXXVI.

    This was an awkward test, as Juan found,
      But he was steeled by Sorrow, Wrath, and Pride:
    With gentle force her white arms he unwound,
      And seated her all drooping by his side,
    Then rising haughtily he glanced around,
      And looking coldly in her face he cried,
    "The prisoned eagle will not pair, nor I
    Serve a Sultana's sensual phantasy.

                      CXXVII.

    "Thou ask'st, if I can love? be this the proof
      How much I _have_ loved--that I love not _thee!_
    In this vile garb, the distaff, web, and woof,
      Were fitter for me: Love is for the free!
    I am not dazzled by this splendid roof;
      Whate'er thy power, and great it seems to be,
    Heads bow, knees bend, eyes watch around a throne,
    And hands obey--our hearts are still our own."

                      CXXVIII.

    This was a truth to us extremely trite;
      Not so to her, who ne'er had heard such things:
    She deemed her least command must yield delight,
      Earth being only made for Queens and Kings.
    If hearts lay on the left side or the right
      She hardly knew, to such perfection brings
    Legitimacy its born votaries, when
    Aware of their due royal rights o'er men.

                      CXXIX.

    Besides, as has been said, she was so fair
      As even in a much humbler lot had made
    A kingdom or confusion anywhere,
      And also, as may be presumed, she laid
    Some stress on charms, which seldom are, if e'er,
      By their possessors thrown into the shade:
    She thought hers gave a double "right divine;"
    And half of that opinion's also mine.

                      CXXX.

    Remember, or (if you can not) imagine,
      Ye! who have kept your chastity when young,
    While some more desperate dowager has been waging
      Love with you, and been in the dog-days stung[fo]
    By your refusal, recollect her raging!
      Or recollect all that was said or sung
    On such a subject; then suppose the face
    Of a young downright beauty in this case!

                      CXXXI.

    Suppose,--but you already have supposed,
      The spouse of Potiphar, the Lady Booby,[307]
    Phaedra,[308] and all which story has disclosed
      Of good examples; pity that so few by
    Poets and private tutors are exposed,[fp]
      To educate--ye youth of Europe--you by!
    But when you have supposed the few we know,
    You can't suppose Gulbeyaz' angry brow.

                      CXXXII.

    A tigress robbed of young, a lioness,
      Or any interesting beast of prey,
    Are similes at hand for the distress
      Of ladies who can _not_ have their own way;
    But though my turn will not be served with less,
      These don't express one half what I should say:
    For what is stealing young ones, few or many,
    To cutting short their hope of having _any?_

                      CXXXIII.

    The love of offspring's Nature's general law,
      From tigresses and cubs to ducks and ducklings;
    There's nothing whets the beak, or arms the claw
      Like an invasion of their babes and sucklings;
    And all who have seen a human nursery, saw
      How mothers love their children's squalls and chucklings:
    This strong extreme effect (to tire no longer
    Your patience) shows the cause must still be stronger.[fq]

                      CXXXIV.

    If I said fire flashed from Gulbeyaz' eyes,
      'T were nothing--for her eyes flashed always fire;
    Or said her cheeks assumed the deepest dyes,
      I should but bring disgrace upon the dyer,
    So supernatural was her passion's rise;
      For ne'er till now she knew a checked desire:
    Even ye who know what a checked woman is
    (Enough, God knows!) would much fall short of this.

                      CXXXV.

    Her rage was but a minute's, and 't was well--
      A moment's more had slain her; but the while
    It lasted 't was like a short glimpse of Hell:
      Nought's more sublime than energetic bile,
    Though horrible to see, yet grand to tell,
      Like Ocean warring 'gainst a rocky isle;
    And the deep passions flashing through her form
    Made her a beautiful embodied storm.

                      CXXXVI.

    A vulgar tempest 't were to a typhoon
      To match a common fury with her rage,
    And yet she did not want to reach the moon,[309]
      Like moderate Hotspur on the immortal page;[fr]
    Her anger pitched into a lower tune,
      Perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age--
    Her wish was but to "kill, kill, kill," like Lear's,[310]
    And then her thirst of blood was quenched in tears.

                      CXXXVII.

    A storm it raged, and like the storm it passed,
      Passed without words--in fact she could not speak;
    And then her sex's shame[311] broke in at last,
      A sentiment till then in her but weak,
    But now it flowed in natural and fast,
      As water through an unexpected leak;
    For she felt humbled--and humiliation
    Is sometimes good for people in her station.

                      CXXXVIII.

    It teaches them that they are flesh and blood,
      It also gently hints to them that others,
    Although of clay, are yet not quite of mud;
      That urns and pipkins are but fragile brothers,
    And works of the same pottery, bad or good,
      Though not all born of the same sires and mothers;
    It teaches--Heaven knows only what it teaches,
    But sometimes it may mend, and often reaches.

                      CXXXIX.

    Her first thought was to cut off Juan's head;
      Her second, to cut only his--acquaintance;
    Her third, to ask him where he had been bred;
      Her fourth, to rally him into repentance;
    Her fifth, to call her maids and go to bed;
      Her sixth, to stab herself; her seventh, to sentence
    The lash to Baba:--but her grand resource
    Was to sit down again, and cry--of course.

                      CXL.

    She thought to stab herself, but then she had
      The dagger close at hand, which made it awkward;
    For Eastern stays are little made to pad,
      So that a poniard pierces if 't is struck hard:
    She thought of killing Juan--but, poor lad!
      Though he deserved it well for being so backward,
    The cutting off his head was not the art
    Most likely to attain her aim--his heart.

                      CXLI.

    Juan was moved: he had made up his mind
      To be impaled, or quartered as a dish
    For dogs, or to be slain with pangs refined,
      Or thrown to lions, or made baits for fish,
    And thus heroically stood resigned,
      Rather than sin--except to his own wish:
    But all his great preparatives for dying
    Dissolved like snow before a woman crying.

                      CXLII.

    As through his palms Bob Acres' valour oozed,[312]
      So Juan's virtue ebbed, I know not how;
    And first he wondered why he had refused;
      And then, if matters could be made up now;
    And next his savage virtue he accused,
      Just as a friar may accuse his vow,
    Or as a dame repents her of her oath,
    Which mostly ends in some small breach of both.

                      CXLIII.

    So he began to stammer some excuses;
      But words are not enough in such a matter,
    Although you borrowed all that e'er the Muses
      Have sung, or even a Dandy's dandiest chatter,
    Or all the figures Castlereagh abuses;[fs]
      Just as a languid smile began to flatter
    His peace was making, but, before he ventured
    Further, old Baba rather briskly entered.

                      CXLIV.

    "Bride of the Sun! and Sister of the Moon!"
      ('T was thus he spake,) "and Empress of the Earth!
    Whose frown would put the spheres all out of tune,
      Whose smile makes all the planets dance with mirth,
    Your slave brings tidings--he hopes not too soon--
      Which your sublime attention may be worth:
    The Sun himself has sent me like a ray,
    To hint that he is coming up this way."

                      CXLV.

    "Is it," exclaimed Gulbeyaz, "as you say?
      I wish to heaven he would not shine till morning!
    But bid my women form the milky way.
      Hence, my old comet! give the stars due warning--[ft]
    And, Christian! mingle with them as you may,
      And as you'd have me pardon your past scorning-----"
    Here they were interrupted by a humming
    Sound, and then by a cry, "The Sultan's coming!"

                      CXLVI.

    First came her damsels, a decorous file,
      And then his Highness' eunuchs, black and white;
    The train might reach a quarter of a mile:
      His Majesty was always so polite
    As to announce his visits a long while
      Before he came, especially at night;
    For being the last wife of the Emperor,
    She was of course the favourite of the four.

                      CXLVII.

    His Highness was a man of solemn port,
      Shawled to the nose, and bearded to the eyes,
    Snatched from a prison to preside at court,
      His lately bowstrung brother caused his rise;
    He was as good a sovereign of the sort
      As any mentioned in the histories
    Of Cantemir, or Knōllěs, where few shine[fu]
    Save Solyman, the glory of their line.[313]

                      CXLVIII.

    He went to mosque in state, and said his prayers
      With more than "Oriental scrupulosity;"[314]
    He left to his vizier all state affairs,
      And showed but little royal curiosity:
    I know not if he had domestic cares--
      No process proved connubial animosity;
    Four wives and twice five hundred maids, unseen,
    Were ruled as calmly as a Christian queen.[fv]

                      CXLIX.

    If now and then there happened a slight slip,
      Little was heard of criminal or crime;
    The story scarcely passed a single lip--
      The sack and sea had settled all in time,
    From which the secret nobody could rip:
      The public knew no more than does this rhyme;
    No scandals made the daily press a curse--
    Morals were better, and the fish no worse.[fw]

                      CL.

    He saw with his own eyes the moon was round,
      Was also certain that the earth was square,
    Because he had journeyed fifty miles, and found
      No sign that it was circular anywhere;[fx]
    His empire also was without a bound:
      'T is true, a little troubled here and there,
    By rebel pachas, and encroaching giaours,
    But then they never came to "the Seven Towers;"[315]

                      CLI.

    Except in shape of envoys, who were sent
      To lodge there when a war broke out, according
    To the true law of nations, which ne'er meant
      Those scoundrels, who have never had a sword in
    Their dirty diplomatic hands, to vent
      Their spleen in making strife, and safely wording
    Their lies, yclept despatches, without risk or
    The singeing of a single inky whisker.

                      CLII.

    He had fifty daughters and four dozen sons,
      Of whom all such as came of age were stowed,
    The former in a palace, where like nuns
      They lived till some Bashaw was sent abroad,
    When she, whose turn it was, was wed at once,
      Sometimes at six years old[316]--though this seems odd,
    'T is true; the reason is, that the Bashaw
    Must make a present to his sire-in-law.

                      CLIII.

    His sons were kept in prison, till they grew
      Of years to fill a bowstring or the throne,
    One or the other, but which of the two
      Could yet be known unto the fates alone;
    Meantime the education they went through
      Was princely, as the proofs have always shown;
    So that the heir apparent still was found
    No less deserving to be hanged than crowned.

                      CLIV.

    His Majesty saluted his fourth spouse
      With all the ceremonies of his rank,
    Who cleared her sparkling eyes and smoothed her brows,
      As suits a matron who has played a prank;
    These must seem doubly mindful of their vows,
      To save the credit of their breaking bank:
    To no men are such cordial greetings given
    As those whose wives have made them fit for Heaven.[317]

                      CLV.

    His Highness cast around his great black eyes,
      And looking, as he always looked, perceived
    Juan amongst the damsels in disguise,
      At which he seemed no whit surprised nor grieved,
    But just remarked with air sedate and wise,[fy]
      While still a fluttering sigh Gulbeyaz heaved,
    "I see you've bought another girl; 't is pity
    That a mere Christian should be half so pretty."

                      CLVI.

    This compliment, which drew all eyes upon
      The new-bought virgin, made her blush and shake.
    Her comrades, also, thought themselves undone:
      Oh! Mahomet! that his Majesty should take
    Such notice of a giaour, while scarce to one
      Of them his lips imperial ever spake!
    There was a general whisper, toss, and wriggle,
    But etiquette forbade them all to giggle.

                      CLVII.

    The Turks do well to shut--at least, sometimes--
      The women up--because, in sad reality,
    Their chastity in these unhappy climes[fz]
      Is not a thing of that astringent quality
    Which in the North prevents precocious crimes,
      And makes our snow less pure than our morality;
    The Sun, which yearly melts the polar ice,
    Has quite the contrary effect--on vice.

                      CLVIII.

    Thus in the East they are extremely strict,
      And wedlock and a padlock mean the same:
    Excepting only when the former's picked
      It ne'er can be replaced in proper frame;
    Spoilt, as a pipe of claret is when pricked:
      But then their own polygamy's to blame;
    Why don't they knead two virtuous souls for life
    Into that moral centaur, man and wife?[318]

                      CLIX.

    Thus far our chronicle; and now we pause,
      Though not for want of matter; but 't is time,
    According to the ancient epic laws,
      To slacken sail, and anchor with our rhyme.
    Let this fifth canto meet with due applause,
      The sixth shall have a touch of the sublime;
    Meanwhile, as Homer sometimes sleeps, perhaps
    You'll pardon to my muse a few short naps.[ga]

{218}[270] [Canto V. was begun at Ravenna, October the 16th, and
finished November the 20th, 1820. It was published August 8, 1821,
together with Cantos III. and IV.]

[271] This expression of Homer has been much criticized. It hardly
answers to our Atlantic ideas of the ocean, but is sufficiently
applicable to the Hellespont, and the Bosphorus, with the Aegean
intersected with islands.

[Vide Iliad, xiv. 245, etc. Homer's "ocean-stream" was not the
Hellespont, but the rim of waters which encircled the disk of the
world.]

{219}[272] ["The pleasure of going in a barge to Chelsea is not
comparable to that of rowing upon the canal of the sea here, where, for
twenty miles together, down the Bosphorus, the most beautiful variety of
prospects present themselves. The Asian side is covered with fruit
trees, villages, and the most delightful landscapes in nature; on the
European stands Constantinople, situated on seven hills; showing an
agreeable mixture of gardens, pine and cypress trees, palaces, mosques,
and public buildings, raised one above another, with as much beauty and
appearance of symmetry as your ladyship ever saw in a cabinet adorned by
the most skilful hands, where jars show themselves above jars, mixed
with canisters, babies, and candlesticks. This is a very odd comparison:
but it gives me an exact idea of the thing."--See letter to Mr. Pope,

[274] The "Giant's Grave" is a height on the Asiatic shore of the
Bosphorus, much frequented by holiday parties; like Harrow and Highgate.

["The Giant's Mountain, 650 feet high, is almost exactly opposite
Buyukdereh ... It is called by the Turks Yoshadagh, _Mountain of
Joshua,_ because the _Giant's Grave_ on the top is, according to the
Moslem legend, the grave of Joshua. The grave was formerly called the
_Couch of Hercules;_ but the classical story is that it was the tomb of
Amycus, king of the Bebryces [on his grave grew the _laurus insana_, a
branch of which caused strife (Plin., _Hist. Nat.,_ lib. xvi. cap. xliv.
ed. 1593, ii. 198)]. The grave is 20 feet long, and 5 feet broad; it is
within a stone enclosure, and is planted with flowers and
bushes."--_Handbook for Constantinople,_ p. 103.]

{227}[279] The assassination alluded to took place on the 8th of
December, 1820, in the streets of Ravenna, not a hundred paces from the
residence of the writer. The circumstances were as described.

["December 9, 1820. I open my letter to tell you a fact, which will show
the state of this country better than I can. The commandant of the
troops is _now_ lying _dead_ in my house. He was shot at a little past
eight o'clock, about two hundred paces from my door. I was putting on my
great coat to visit Madame la Comtessa G., when I heard the shot. On
coming into the hall, I found all my servants on the balcony, exclaiming
that a man was murdered. I immediately ran down, calling on Tita (the
bravest of them) to follow me. The rest wanted to hinder us from going,
as it is the custom for everybody here, it seems, to run away from 'the
stricken deer.' ... we found him lying on his back, almost, if not
quite, dead, with five wounds; one in the heart, two in the stomach, one
in the finger, and the other in the arm. Some soldiers cocked their
guns, and wanted to hinder me from passing. However, we passed, and I
found Diego, the adjutant, crying over him like a child--a surgeon, who
said nothing of his profession--a priest, sobbing a frightened
prayer--and the commandant, all this time, on his back, on the hard,
cold pavement, without light or assistance, or anything around him but
confusion and dismay. As nobody could, or would, do anything but howl
and pray, and as no one would stir a finger to move him, for fear of
consequences, I lost my patience--made my servant and a couple of the
mob take up the body--sent off two soldiers to the guard--despatched
Diego to the Cardinal with the news, and had him carried upstairs into
my own quarters. But it was too late--he was gone.... I had him partly
stripped--made the surgeon examine him, and examined him myself. He had
been shot by cut balls or slugs. I felt one of the slugs, which had gone
through him, all but the skin.... He only said, 'O Dio!' and 'Gesu!' two
or three times, and appeared to have suffered little. Poor fellow! he
was a brave officer; but had made himself much disliked by the
people."--Letter to Moore, December 9, 1820, _Letters,_ 1901, v. 133.
The commandant's name was Del Pinto (_Life,_ p. 472).]

[285] In Turkey nothing is more common than for the Mussulmans to take
several glasses of strong spirits by way of appetiser. I have seen them
take as many as six of raki before dinner, and swear that they dined the
better for it: I tried the experiment, but fared like the Scotchman, who
having heard that the birds called kittiwakes were admirable whets, ate
six of them, and complained that "he was no hungrier than when he
began."

old age, her house was the rendezvous of wits and men of letters.
Scarron is said to have consulted her on his romances, Saint-Evremond on
his poems, Molière on his comedies, Fontenelle on his dialogues, and La

The adventures of Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, and Bellerophon are

disappointed fair ones. It is very probable that both the stories are

[313] It may not be unworthy of remark, that Bacon, in his essay on
"Empire" (Essays, No. xx.), hints that Solyman was the last of his line;
on what authority, I know not. These are his words: "The destruction of
Mustapha was so fatal to Solyman's line; as the succession of the Turks
from Solyman until this day is suspected to be untrue, and of strange
blood; for that Selymus the second was thought to be supposititious."
But Bacon, in his historical authorities, is often inaccurate. I could
give half a dozen instances from his Apophthegms only.

[Selim II. (1524-1574) succeeded his father as Sultan in 1566. Hofmann
(_Lexicon Univ_.) describes him as "meticulosus, effeminatus, ebriosus,"
but neither Demetrius Cantemir, in his _History of the Growth and Decay
of the Othman Empire_ (translated by N. Tyndal, 1734); nor _The Turkish
History_ (written by Mr. Knolles, 1701), cast any doubts on his
legitimacy. Byron complained of the omission from the notes to the first
edition of Don Juan, of his corrections of Bacon's "Apophthegms" (see
_Letters_, 1901, v. Appendix VI. pp. 597-600), in a letter to Murray,

               PREFACE TO CANTOS VI., VII., AND VIII.


THE details of the siege of Ismail in two of the following cantos
(_i.e._ the seventh and eighth) are taken from a French Work, entitled
_Histoire de la Nouvelle Russie._[319] Some of the incidents attributed
to Don Juan really occurred, particularly the circumstance of his saving
the infant, which was the actual case of the late Duc de Richelieu, then
a young volunteer in the Russian service, and afterward the founder and
benefactor of Odessa, where his name and memory can never cease to be
regarded with reverence.

In the course of these cantos, a stanza or two will be found relative to
the late Marquis of Londonderry,[320] but written some time before his
decease. Had that person's oligarchy died with him, they would have been
suppressed; as it is, I am aware of nothing in the manner of his death
or of his life to prevent the free expression of the opinions of all
whom his whole existence was consumed in endeavouring to enslave. That
he was an amiable man in _private_ life, may or may not be true: but
with this the public have nothing to do; and as to lamenting his death,
it will be time enough when Ireland has ceased to mourn for his birth.
As a minister, I, for one of millions, looked upon him as the most
despotic in intention, and the weakest in intellect, that ever
tyrannised over a country. It is the first time indeed since the Normans
that England has been insulted by a _minister_ (at least) who could not
speak English, and that Parliament permitted itself to be dictated to in
the language of Mrs. Malaprop.

Of the manner of his death little need be said, except that if a poor
radical, such as Waddington or Watson,[321] had cut his throat, he would
have been buried in a cross-road, with the usual appurtenances of the stake
and mallet. But the minister was an elegant lunatic--a sentimental
suicide--he merely cut the "carotid artery," (blessings on their learning!)
and lo! the pageant, and the Abbey! and "the syllables of dolour yelled
forth"[322] by the newspapers--and the harangue of the Coroner in a eulogy
over the bleeding body of the deceased--(an Anthony worthy of such a
Cæsar)--and the nauseous and atrocious cant of a degraded crew of
conspirators against all that is sincere and honourable. In his death he
was necessarily one of two things by the law[323]--a felon or a madman--and
in either case no great subject for panegyric.[324] In his life he
was--what all the world knows, and half of it will feel for years to come,
unless his death prove a "moral lesson" to the surviving Sejani[325] of
Europe. It may at least serve as some consolation to the nations, that
their oppressors are not happy, and in some instances judge so justly of
their own actions as to anticipate the sentence of mankind. Let us hear no
more of this man; and let Ireland remove the ashes of her Grattan from the
sanctuary of Westminster. Shall the patriot of humanity repose by the
Werther of politics!!!

With regard to the objections which have been made on another score to
the already published cantos of this poem, I shall content myself with
two quotations from Voltaire:--"La pudeur s'est enfuite des coeurs, et
s'est refugiée sur les lèvres." ... "Plus les moeurs sont dépravés, plus
les expressions deviennent mesurées; on croit regagner en langage ce
qu'on a perdu en vertu."

This is the real fact, as applicable to the degraded and hypocritical
mass which leavens the present English generation, and is the only
answer they deserve. The hackneyed and lavished title of
Blasphemer--which, with Radical, Liberal, Jacobin, Reformer, etc., are
the changes which the hirelings are daily ringing in the ears of those
who will listen--should be welcome to all who recollect on _whom_ it was
originally bestowed. Socrates and Jesus Christ were put to death
publicly as _blasphemers_, and so have been and may be many who dare to
oppose the most notorious abuses of the name of God and the mind of man.
But persecution is not refutation, nor even triumph: the "wretched
infidel," as he is called, is probably happier in his prison than the
proudest of his assailants. With his opinions I have nothing to do--they
may be right or wrong--but he has suffered for them, and that very
suffering for conscience' sake will make more proselytes to deism than
the example of heterodox[326] Prelates to Christianity, suicide
statesmen to oppression, or overpensioned homicides to the impious
alliance which insults the world with the name of "Holy!"[327] I have no
wish to trample on the dishonoured or the dead; but it would be well if
the adherents to the classes from whence those persons sprung should
abate a little of the cant which is the crying sin of this
double-dealing and false-speaking time of selfish spoilers, and----but
enough for the present.

acquaintance of Armand Emanuel, Duc de Richelieu, who took part in the

{266}[321] [Samuel Ferrand Waddington, born 1759, hop-grower and radical
politician, first came into notice as the chairman of public meetings in
favour of making peace with the French in 1793. He was the author,
_inter alia_, of _A Key to a Delicate Investigation_, 1812, and _An
Address to the People of the United Kingdom_, 1812. He was alive in
1822. James Watson (1766-1838), a radical agitator of the following of
Thomas Spence, was engaged, in the autumn of 1816, in an abortive
conspiracy to blow up cavalry barracks, barricade the streets, and seize
the Bank and the Tower. He was tried for high treason before Lord
Ellenborough, and acquitted.]

gently; but as the legitimates have always the law in their mouths, let
them here make the most of it.

[324] [Mr. Joseph Carttar, of Deptford, coroner for the County of Kent,
addressed the jury at some length. The following sentences are taken
from the report of the inquest, contained in _The Annual Biography and
Obituary for the year 1823_, vol. vii. p. 57: "As a public man, it is
impossible for me to weigh his character in any scales that I can hold.
In private life I believe the world will admit that a more amiable man
could not be found.... If it should unfortunately appear that there is
not sufficient evidence to prove what is generally considered the
indication of a disordered mind, I trust that the jury will pay some
attention to my humble opinion, which is, that no man can be in his
proper senses at the moment he commits so rash an act as self-murder.
...The Bible declares that a man clings to nothing so strongly as his
own life, I therefore view it as an axiom, and an abstract principle,
that a man must necessarily be out of his mind at the moment of
destroying himself." Byron, probably, read the report of the inquest in
Cobbett's _Weekly Register_ (August 17, 1822, vol. 43, pp. 389-425). The
"eulogy" was in perfectly good taste, but there can be little doubt that
if "Waddington or Watson" had cut _their_ "carotid arteries," the
verdict would have been different.]

[325] From this number must be excepted Canning. Canning is a genius,
almost a universal one, an orator, a wit, a poet, a statesman; and no
man of talent can long pursue the path of his late predecessor, Lord C.
If ever man saved his country, Canning _can_, but _will_ he? I for one,
hope so.

[The phrase, "great moral lesson," was employed by the Duke of
Wellington, _à propos_ of the restoration of pictures and statues to
their "rightful owners," in a despatch addressed to Castlereagh, under
date, Paris, September 19, 1815 (_The Dispatches, etc._ (ed. by Colonel
Gurwood), 1847, viii. 270). The words, "moral lesson," as applied to the
French generally, are to be found in Scott's _Field of Waterloo_
(conclusion, stanza vi. line 3), which was written about the same time
as the despatch. Byron quotes them in his "Ode from the French," stanza
iv. line 8 (see _Poetical Works_, 1900, iii. 434, note 1). There is a
satirical allusion to the Duke's "assumption of the didactic" about
teaching a "great moral lesson" in the Preface to the first number of
the _Liberal_ (1822, p. xi.).]

{267}[326] When Lord Sandwich said "he did not know the difference
between orthodoxy and heterodoxy," Warburton, the bishop, replied,
"Orthodoxy, my lord, is _my doxy_, and heterodoxy is _another man's_
doxy." A prelate of the present day has discovered, it seems, a _third_
kind of doxy, which has not greatly exalted in the eyes of the elect
that which Bentham calls "Church-of-Englandism."

             CANTO THE SIXTH.[328]

                      I.

    "There is a tide in the affairs of men,
      Which,--taken at the flood,"--you know the rest,[329]
    And most of us have found it now and then:
      At least we think so, though but few have guessed
    The moment, till too late to come again.
      But no doubt everything is for the best--
    Of which the surest sign is in the end:
    When things are at the worst they sometimes mend.

                      II.

    There is a tide in the affairs of women,
      Which, taken at the flood, leads--God knows where:
    Those navigators must be able seamen
      Whose charts lay down its currents to a hair;
    Not all the reveries of Jacob Behmen[330]
      With its strange whirls and eddies can compare:
    Men with their heads reflect on this and that--
    But women with their hearts on Heaven knows what![gb]

                      III.

    And yet a headlong, headstrong, downright She,
      Young, beautiful, and daring--who would risk
    A throne--the world--the universe--to be
      Beloved in her own way--and rather whisk
    The stars from out the sky, than not be free[gc]
      As are the billows when the breeze is brisk--
    Though such a She's a devil (if there be one),
    Yet she would make full many a Manichean.

                      IV.

    Thrones, worlds, _et cetera_, are so oft upset
      By commonest ambition, that when Passion
    O'erthrows the same, we readily forget,
      Or at the least forgive, the loving rash one.
    If Anthony be well remembered yet,
      'T is not his conquests keep his name in fashion,
    But Actium, lost for Cleopatra's eyes,
    Outbalances all Cæsar's victories.[gd]

                      V.

    He died at fifty for a queen of forty;
      I wish their years had been fifteen and twenty,[ge]
    For then wealth, kingdoms, worlds are but a sport--I
      Remember when, though I had no great plenty
    Of worlds to lose, yet still, to pay my court, I
      Gave what I had--a heart;[331] as the world went, I
    Gave what was worth a world; for worlds could never
    Restore me those pure feelings, gone for ever.

                      VI.

    'T was the boy's "mite," and, like the "widow's," may
      Perhaps be weighed hereafter, if not now;
    But whether such things do or do not weigh,
      All who have loved, or love, will still allow
    Life has nought like it. God is Love, they say,
      And Love's a god, or was before the brow
    Of Earth was wrinkled by the sins and tears
    Of--but Chronology best knows the years.

                      VII.

    We left our hero and third heroine in
      A kind of state more awkward than uncommon,
    For gentlemen must sometimes risk their skin
      For that sad tempter, a forbidden woman:
    Sultans too much abhor this sort of sin,
      And don't agree at all with the wise Roman,
    Heroic, stoic Cato, the sententious,
    Who lent his lady to his friend Hortensius.[332]

                      VIII.

    I know Gulbeyaz was extremely wrong;
      I own it, I deplore it, I condemn it;
    But I detest all fiction even in song,
      And so must tell the truth, howe'er you blame it.
    Her reason being weak, her passions strong,
      She thought that her Lord's heart (even could she claim it)
    Was scarce enough; for he had fifty-nine
    Years, and a fifteen-hundredth concubine.

                      IX.

    I am not, like Cassio, "an arithmetician,"
      But by "the bookish theoric"[333] it appears,
    If 't is summed up with feminine precision,
      That, adding to the account his Highness' years,
    The fair Sultana erred from inanition;
      For, were the Sultan just to all his dears,
    She could but claim the fifteen-hundredth part
    Of what should be monopoly--the heart.

                      X.

    It is observed that ladies are litigious
      Upon all legal objects of possession,
    And not the least so when they are religious,
      Which doubles what they think of the transgression:
    With suits and prosecutions they besiege us,
      As the tribunals show through many a session,
    When they suspect that any one goes shares
    In that to which the law makes them sole heirs.

                      XI.

    Now, if this holds good in a Christian land,
      The heathen also, though with lesser latitude,[gf]
    Are apt to carry things with a high hand,
      And take, what Kings call "an imposing attitude;"
    And for their rights connubial make a stand,
      When their liege husbands treat them with ingratitude;
    And as four wives must have quadruple claims,
    The Tigris hath its jealousies like Thames.

                      XII.

    Gulbeyaz was the fourth, and (as I said)
      The favourite; but what's favour amongst four?
    Polygamy may well be held in dread,
      Not only as a sin, but as a bore:
    Most wise men with one moderate woman wed,[gg]
      Will scarcely find philosophy for more;
    And all (except Mahometans) forbear
    To make the nuptial couch a "Bed of Ware."[334]

                      XIII.

    His Highness, the sublimest of mankind,--[gh]
      So styled according to the usual forms
    Of every monarch, till they are consigned
      To those sad hungry Jacobins the worms,
    Who on the very loftiest kings have dined,--
      His Highness gazed upon Gulbeyaz' charms,
    Expecting all the welcome of a lover
    (A "Highland welcome"[335] all the wide world over).

                      XIV.

    Now here we should distinguish; for howe'er
      Kisses, sweet words, embraces, and all that,
    May look like what it is--neither here nor there,[gi]
      They are put on as easily as a hat,
    Or rather bonnet, which the fair sex wear,
      Trimmed either heads or hearts to decorate,
    Which form an ornament, but no more part
    Of heads, than their caresses of the heart.

                      XV.

    A slight blush, a soft tremor, a calm kind
      Of gentle feminine delight, and shown
    More in the eyelids than the eyes, resigned
      Rather to hide what pleases most unknown,
    Are the best tokens (to a modest mind)[gj]
      Of Love, when seated on his loveliest throne,
    A sincere woman's breast,--for over-_warm_
    Or over-_cold_ annihilates the charm.

                      XVI.

    For over-warmth, if false, is worse than truth;
      If true, 't is no great lease of its own fire;
    For no one, save in very early youth,
      Would like (I think) to trust all to desire,
    Which is but a precarious bond, in sooth,
      And apt to be transferred to the first buyer
    At a sad discount: while your over chilly
    Women, on t' other hand, seem somewhat silly.

                      XVII.

    That is, we cannot pardon their bad taste,
      For so it seems to lovers swift or slow,
    Who fain would have a mutual flame confessed,
      And see a sentimental passion glow,
    Even were St. Francis' paramour their guest,
      In his monastic concubine of snow;--[336]
    In short, the maxim for the amorous tribe is
    Horatian, "_Medio tu tutissimus ibis_"[337]

                      XVIII.

    The "tu" 's _too_ much,--but let it stand,--the verse
      Requires it, that's to say, the English rhyme,
    And not the pink of old hexameters;
      But, after all, there's neither tune nor time
    In the last line, which cannot well be worse,[gk]
      And was thrust in to close the octave's chime:
    I own no prosody can ever rate it
    As a rule, but _Truth_ may, if you translate it.

                      XIX.

    If fair Gulbeyaz overdid her part,
      I know not--it succeeded, and success
    Is much in most things, not less in the heart
      Than other articles of female dress.
    Self-love in Man, too, beats all female art;[gl]
      They lie, we lie, all lie, but love no less:
    And no one virtue yet, except starvation,
    Could stop that worst of vices--propagation.

                      XX.

    We leave this royal couple to repose:
      A bed is not a throne, and they may sleep,
    Whate'er their dreams be, if of joys or woes:
      Yet disappointed joys are woes as deep
    As any man's clay mixture undergoes.
      Our least of sorrows are such as we _weep_;
    'T is the vile daily drop on drop which wears
    The soul out (like the stone) with petty cares.[gm]

                      XXI.

    A scolding wife, a sullen son, a bill
      To pay, unpaid, protested, or discounted
    At a per-centage; a child cross, dog ill,
      A favourite horse fallen lame just as he's mounted,
    A bad old woman making a worse will,[338]
      Which leaves you minus of the cash you counted[gn]
    As certain;--these are paltry things, and yet
    I've rarely seen the man they did not fret.

                      XXII.

    I'm a philosopher; confound them all![go]
      Bills, beasts, and men, and--no! not womankind![gp]
    With one good hearty curse I vent my gall,
      And then my Stoicism leaves nought behind
    Which it can either pain or evil call,
      And I can give my whole soul up to mind;
    Though what _is_ soul, or mind, their birth or growth,
    Is more than I know--the deuce take them both![gq]

                      XXIII.

    So now all things are damned one feels at ease,
      As after reading Athanasius' curse,
    Which doth your true believer so much please:
      I doubt if any now could make it worse
    O'er his worst enemy when at his knees,
      'T is so sententious, positive, and terse,
    And decorates the Book of Common Prayer,
    As doth a rainbow the just clearing air.

                      XXIV.

    Gulbeyaz and her lord were sleeping, or
      At least one of them!--Oh, the heavy night,
    When wicked wives, who love some bachelor,[gr]
      Lie down in dudgeon to sigh for the light
    Of the grey morning, and look vainly for
      Its twinkle through the lattice dusky quite--
    To toss, to tumble, doze, revive, and quake
    Lest their too lawful bed-fellow should wake![gs]

                      XXV.

    These are beneath the canopy of heaven,
      Also beneath the canopy of beds
    Four-posted and silk-curtained, which are given
      For rich men and their brides to lay their heads
    Upon, in sheets white as what bards call "driven
      Snow,"[339] Well! 't is all hap-hazard when one weds.
    Gulbeyaz was an empress, but had been
    Perhaps as wretched if a _peasants quean_.

                      XXVI.

    Don Juan in his feminine disguise,[340]
      With all the damsels in their long array,
    Had bowed themselves before th' imperial eyes,
      And at the usual signal ta'en their way
    Back to their chambers, those long galleries
      In the seraglio, where the ladies lay
    Their delicate limbs; a thousand bosoms there
    Beating for Love, as the caged bird's for air.

                      XXVII.

    I love the sex, and sometimes would reverse
      The Tyrant's[341] wish, "that Mankind only had
    One neck, which he with one fell stroke might pierce:"
      My wish is quite as wide, but not so bad,[gt]
    And much more tender on the whole than fierce;
      It being (not _now_, but only while a lad)
    That Womankind had but one rosy mouth,[gu]
    To kiss them all at once from North to South.

                      XXVIII.

    Oh, enviable Briareus! with thy hands
      And heads, if thou hadst all things multiplied
    In such proportion!--But my Muse withstands
      The giant thought of being a Titan's bride,
    Or travelling in Patagonian lands;
      So let us back to Lilliput, and guide
    Our hero through the labyrinth of Love
    In which we left him several lines above.

                      XXIX.

    He went forth with the lovely Odalisques,[342]
      At the given signal joined to their array;
    And though he certainly ran many risks,
      Yet he could not at times keep, by the way,
    (Although the consequences of such frisks
      Are worse than the worst damages men pay
    In moral England, where the thing's a tax,)
    From ogling all their charms from breasts to backs.

                      XXX.

    Still he forgot not his disguise:--along
      The galleries from room to room they walked,
    A virgin-like and edifying throng,
      By eunuchs flanked; while at their head there stalked
    A dame who kept up discipline among
      The female ranks, so that none stirred or talked,
    Without her sanction on their she-parades:
    Her title was "the Mother of the Maids."

                      XXXI.

    Whether she was a "Mother," I know not,
      Or whether they were "Maids" who called her Mother;
    But this is her Seraglio title, got
      I know not how, but good as any other;
    So Cantemir[343] can tell you, or De Tott:[344]
      Her office was to keep aloof or smother
    All bad propensities in fifteen hundred
    Young women, and correct them when they blundered.

                      XXXII.

    A goodly sinecure, no doubt! but made
      More easy by the absence of all men--
    Except his Majesty,--who, with her aid,
      And guards, and bolts, and walls, and now and then
    A slight example, just to cast a shade
      Along the rest, contrived to keep this den
    Of beauties cool as an Italian convent,
    Where all the passions have, alas! but one vent.

                      XXXIII.

    And what is that? Devotion, doubtless--how
      Could you ask such a question?--but we will
    Continue. As I said, this goodly row
      Of ladies of all countries at the will[345]
    Of one good man, with stately march and slow,
      Like water-lilies floating down a rill--
    Or rather lake--for _rills_ do _not_ run _slowly_,--
    Paced on most maiden-like and melancholy.

                      XXXIV.

    But when they reached their own apartments, there,
      Like birds, or boys, or bedlamites broke loose,
    Waves at spring-tide, or women anywhere
      When freed from bonds (which are of no great use
    After all), or like Irish at a fair,
      Their guards being gone, and as it were a truce
    Established between them and bondage, they
    Began to sing, dance, chatter, smile, and play.

                      XXXV.

    Their talk, of course, ran most on the new comer;
      Her shape, her hair, her air, her everything:
    Some thought her dress did not so much become her,
      Or wondered at her ears without a ring;
    Some said her years were getting nigh their summer,
      Others contended they were but in spring;
    Some thought her rather masculine in height,
    While others wished that she had been so quite.

                      XXXVI.

    But no one doubted on the whole, that she
      Was what her dress bespoke, a damsel fair,
    And fresh, and "beautiful exceedingly,"[346]
      Who with the brightest Georgians[347] might compare:
    They wondered how Gulbeyaz, too, could be
      So silly as to buy slaves who might share
    (If that his Highness wearied of his bride)
    Her Throne and Power, and everything beside.

                      XXXVII.

    But what was strangest in this virgin crew,
      Although her beauty was enough to vex,
    After the first investigating view,
      They all found out as few, or fewer, specks
    In the fair form of their companion new,
      Than is the custom of the gentle sex,
    When they survey, with Christian eyes or Heathen,
    In a new face "the ugliest creature breathing."

                      XXXVIII.

    And yet they had their little jealousies,
      Like all the rest; but upon this occasion,
    Whether there are such things as sympathies
      Without our knowledge or our approbation,
    Although they could not see through his disguise,
      All felt a soft kind of concatenation,
    Like Magnetism, or Devilism, or what
    You please--we will not quarrel about that:

                      XXXIX.

    But certain 't is they all felt for their new
      Companion something newer still, as 't were
    A sentimental friendship through and through,
      Extremely pure, which made them all concur
    In wishing her their sister, save a few
      Who wished they had a brother just like her,
    Whom, if they were at home in sweet Circassia,
    They would prefer to Padisha[348] or Pacha.

                      XL.

    Of those who had most genius for this sort
      Of sentimental friendship, there were three,
    Lolah, Katinka,[349] and Dudù--in short
      (To save description), fair as fair can be
    Were they, according to the best report,
      Though differing in stature and degree,
    And clime and time, and country and complexion--
    They all alike admired their new connection.

                      XLI.

    Lolah was dusk as India and as warm;
      Katinka was a Georgian, white and red,
    With great blue eyes, a lovely hand and arm,
      And feet so small they scarce seemed made to tread,
    But rather skim the earth; while Dudù's form
      Looked more adapted to be put to bed,
    Being somewhat large, and languishing, and lazy,
    Yet of a beauty that would drive you crazy.

                      XLII.

    A kind of sleepy Venus seemed Dudù,
      Yet very fit to "murder sleep"[350] in those
    Who gazed upon her cheek's transcendent hue,
      Her Attic forehead, and her Phidian nose:
    Few angles were there in her form, 't is true,
      Thinner she might have been, and yet scarce lose;
    Yet, after all, 't would puzzle to say where
    It would not spoil some separate charm to _pare_.

                      XLIII.

    She was not violently lively, but
      Stole on your spirit like a May-day breaking;
    Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet, half-shut,
      They put beholders in a tender taking;
    She looked (this simile's quite new) just cut
      From marble, like Pygmalion's statue waking,
    The mortal and the marble still at strife,
    And timidly expanding into Life.

                      XLIV.

    Lolah demanded the new damsel's name--
      "Juanna."--Well, a pretty name enough.
    Katinka asked her also whence she came--
      "From Spain."--"But where _is_ Spain?"--"Don't ask such stuff,
    Nor show your Georgian ignorance--for shame!"
      Said Lolah, with an accent rather rough,
    To poor Katinka: "Spain's an island near
    Morocco, betwixt Egypt and Tangier."

                      XLV.

    Dudù said nothing, but sat down beside
      Juanna, playing with her veil or hair;
    And, looking at her steadfastly, she sighed,
      As if she pitied her for being there,
    A pretty stranger without friend or guide,
      And all abashed, too, at the general stare
    Which welcomes hapless strangers in all places,
    With kind remarks upon their mien and faces.

                      XLVI.

    But here the Mother of the Maids drew near,
      With "Ladies, it is time to go to rest.
    I'm puzzled what to do with _you_, my dear!"
      She added to Juanna, their new guest:
    "Your coming has been unexpected here,
      And every couch is occupied; you had best
    Partake of mine; but by to-morrow early
    We will have all things settled for you fairly."

                      XLVII.

    Here Lolah interposed--"Mamma, you know
      You don't sleep soundly, and I cannot bear
    That anybody should disturb you so;
      I'll take Juanna; we're a slenderer pair
    Than you would make the half of;--don't say no;
      And I of your young charge will take due care."
    But here Katinka interfered, and said,
    "She also had compassion and a bed."

                      XLVIII.

    "Besides, I hate to sleep alone," quoth she.
      The matron frowned: "Why so?"--"For fear of ghosts,"
    Replied Katinka; "I am sure I see
      A phantom upon each of the four posts;
    And then I have the worst dreams that can be,
      Of Guebres, Giaours, and Ginns, and Gouls in hosts."
    The dame replied, "Between your dreams and you,
    I fear Juanna's dreams would be but few.

                      XLIX.

    "You, Lolah, must continue still to lie
      Alone, for reasons which don't matter; you
    The same, Katinka, until by and by:
      And I shall place Juanna with Dudù,
    Who's quiet, inoffensive, silent, shy,
      And will not toss and chatter the night through.
    What say you, child?"--Dudù said nothing, as
    Her talents were of the more silent class;

                      L.

    But she rose up, and kissed the matron's brow
      Between the eyes, and Lolah on both cheeks,
    Katinka too; and with a gentle bow
      (Curt'sies are neither used by Turks nor Greeks)
    She took Juanna by the hand to show
      Their place of rest, and left to both their piques,
    The others pouting at the matron's preference
    Of Dudù, though they held their tongues from deference.

                      LI.

    It was a spacious chamber (Oda is
      The Turkish title), and ranged round the wall
    Were couches, toilets--and much more than this
      I might describe, as I have seen it all,
    But it suffices--little was amiss;
      'T was on the whole a nobly furnished hall,
    With all things ladies want, save one or two,
    And even those were nearer than they knew.

                      LII.

    Dudù, as has been said, was a sweet creature,
      Not very dashing, but extremely winning,
    With the most regulated charms of feature,
      Which painters cannot catch like faces sinning
    Against proportion--the wild strokes of nature
      Which they hit off at once in the beginning,
    Full of expression, right or wrong, that strike,
    And pleasing, or unpleasing, still are like.

                      LIII.

    But she was a soft landscape of mild earth,
      Where all was harmony, and calm, and quiet,
    Luxuriant, budding; cheerful without mirth,
      Which, if not happiness, is much more nigh it
    Than are your mighty passions and so forth,
      Which, some call "the Sublime:" I wish they'd try it:
    I've seen your stormy seas and stormy women,
    And pity lovers rather more than seamen.

                      LIV.

    But she was pensive more than melancholy,
      And serious more than pensive, and serene,
    It may be, more than either--not unholy
      Her thoughts, at least till now, appear to have been.
    The strangest thing was, beauteous, she was wholly
      Unconscious, albeit turned of quick seventeen,
    That she was fair, or dark, or short, or tall;
    She never thought about herself at all.

                      LV.

    And therefore was she kind and gentle as
      The Age of Gold (when gold was yet unknown,
    By which its nomenclature came to pass;[gv]
      Thus most appropriately has been shown
    "Lucus à _non_ lucendo," _not_ what _was_,
      But what _was not_; a sort of style that's grown
    Extremely common in this age, whose metal
    The Devil may decompose, but never settle:[gw]

                      LVI.

    I think it may be of "Corinthian Brass,"[351]
      Which was a mixture of all metals, but
    The brazen uppermost). Kind reader! pass
      This long parenthesis: I could not shut
    It sooner for the soul of me, and class
      My faults even with your own! which meaneth, Put
    A kind construction upon them and me:
    But _that_ you won't--then don't--I am not less free.

                      LVII.

    'T is time we should return to plain narration,
      And thus my narrative proceeds:--Dudù,
    With every kindness short of ostentation,
      Showed Juan, or Juanna, through and through
    This labyrinth of females, and each station
      Described--what's strange--in words extremely few:
    I have but one simile, and that's a blunder,
    For wordless woman, which is _silent_ thunder.[gx]

                      LVIII.

    And next she gave her (I say _her_, because
      The gender still was epicene, at least
    In outward show, which is a saving clause)
      An outline of the customs of the East,
    With all their chaste integrity of laws,
      By which the more a Harem is increased,
    The stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties
    Of any supernumerary beauties.

                      LIX.

    And then she gave Juanna a chaste kiss:
      Dudú was fond of kissing--which I'm sure
    That nobody can ever take amiss,
      Because 't is pleasant, so that it be pure,
    And between females means no more than this--
      That they have nothing better near, or newer.
    "Kiss" rhymes to "bliss" in fact as well as verse--
    I wish it never led to something worse.

                      LX.

    In perfect innocence she then unmade
      Her toilet, which cost little, for she was
    A child of Nature, carelessly arrayed:
      If fond of a chance ogle at her glass,
    'T was like the fawn, which, in the lake displayed,
      Beholds her own shy, shadowy image pass,
    When first she starts, and then returns to peep,
    Admiring this new native of the deep.

                      LXI.

    And one by one her articles of dress
      Were laid aside; but not before she offered
    Her aid to fair Juanna, whose excess
      Of modesty declined the assistance proffered:
    Which passed well off--as she could do no less;
      Though by this _politesse_ she rather suffered,
    Pricking her fingers with those cursed pins,
    Which surely were invented for our sins,--

                      LXII.

    Making a woman like a porcupine,
      Not to be rashly touched. But still more dread,
    Oh ye! whose fate it is, as once 't was mine,
      In early youth, to turn a lady's maid;--
    I did my very boyish best to shine
      In tricking her out for a masquerade:
    The pins were placed sufficiently, but not
    Stuck all exactly in the proper spot.

                      LXIII.

    But these are foolish things to all the wise,
      And I love Wisdom more than she loves me;
    My tendency is to philosophise
      On most things, from a tyrant to a tree;
    But still the spouseless virgin _Knowledge_ flies.
      What are we? and whence came we? what shall be
    Our _ultimate_ existence? what's our present?
    Are questions answerless, and yet incessant.

                      LXIV.

    There was deep silence in the chamber: dim
      And distant from each other burned the lights,
    And slumber hovered o'er each lovely limb
      Of the fair occupants: if there be sprites,
    They should have walked there in their sprightliest trim,
      By way of change from their sepulchral sites,
    And shown themselves as ghosts of better taste
    Than haunting some old ruin or wild waste.

                      LXV.

    Many and beautiful lay those around,
      Like flowers of different hue, and clime, and root,
    In some exotic garden sometimes found,
      With cost, and care, and warmth induced to shoot.
    One with her auburn tresses lightly bound,
      And fair brows gently drooping, as the fruit
    Nods from the tree, was slumbering with soft breath,
    And lips apart, which showed the pearls beneath.

                      LXVI.

    One with her flushed cheek laid on her white arm,
      And raven ringlets gathered in dark crowd
    Above her brow, lay dreaming soft and warm;
      And smiling through her dream, as through a cloud
    The moon breaks, half unveiled each further charm,
      As, slightly stirring in her snowy shroud,
    Her beauties seized the unconscious hour of night
    All bashfully to struggle into light.

                      LXVII.

    This is no bull, although it sounds so; for
      'T was night, but there were lamps, as hath been said.
    A third's all pallid aspect offered more
      The traits of sleeping sorrow, and betrayed
    Through the heaved breast the dream of some far shore
      Belovéd and deplored; while slowly strayed
    (As night-dew, on a cypress glittering, tinges
    The black bough) tear-drops through her eyes' dark fringes.

                      LXVIII.

    A fourth as marble, statue-like and still,
      Lay in a breathless, hushed, and stony sleep;
    White, cold, and pure, as looks a frozen rill,
      Or the snow minaret on an Alpine steep,
    Or Lot's wife done in salt,--or what you will;--
      My similes are gathered in a heap,
    So pick and choose--perhaps you'll be content
    With a carved lady on a monument.

                      LXIX.

    And lo! a fifth appears;--and what is she?
      A lady of a "certain age,"[352] which means
    Certainly agéd--what her years might be
      I know not, never counting past their teens;
    But there she slept, not quite so fair to see,
      As ere that awful period intervenes
    Which lays both men and women on the shelf,
    To meditate upon their sins and self.

                      LXX.

    But all this time how slept, or dreamed, Dudú?
      With strict inquiry I could ne'er discover,
    And scorn to add a syllable untrue;
      But ere the middle watch was hardly over,
    Just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue,
      And phantoms hovered, or might seem to hover,
    To those who like their company, about
    The apartment, on a sudden she screamed out:

                      LXXI.

    And that so loudly, that upstarted all
      The Oda, in a general commotion:
    Matron and maids, and those whom you may call
      Neither, came crowding like the waves of Ocean,
    One on the other, throughout the whole hall,
      All trembling, wondering, without the least notion
    More than I have myself of what could make
    The calm Dudù so turbulently wake.

                      LXXII.

    But wide awake she was, and round her bed.
      With floating draperies and with flying hair,
    With eager eyes, and light but hurried tread,
      And bosoms, arms, and ankles glancing bare,
    And bright as any meteor ever bred
      By the North Pole,--they sought her cause of care,
    For she seemed agitated, flushed, and frightened,
    Her eye dilated, and her colour heightened.

                      LXXIII.

    But what is strange--and a strong proof how great
      A blessing is sound sleep--Juanna lay
    As fast as ever husband by his mate
      In holy matrimony snores away.
    Not all the clamour broke her happy state
      Of slumber, ere they shook her,--so they say
    At least,--and then she, too, unclosed her eyes,
    And yawned a good deal with discreet surprise.[gy]

                      LXXIV.

    And now commenced a strict investigation,
      Which, as all spoke at once, and more than once
    Conjecturing, wondering, asking a narration,
      Alike might puzzle either wit or dunce
    To answer in a very clear oration.
      Dudú had never passed for wanting sense,
    But being "no orator as Brutus is,"[353]
    Could not at first expound what was amiss.

                      LXXV.

    At length she said, that in a slumber sound
      She dreamed a dream, of walking in a wood--
    A "wood obscure," like that where Dante found[354]
      Himself in at the age when all grow good;[gz]
    Life's half-way house, where dames with virtue crowned
      Run much less risk of lovers turning rude;
    And that this wood was full of pleasant fruits,
    And trees of goodly growth and spreading roots;

                      LXXVI.

    And in the midst a golden apple grew,--
      A most prodigious pippin--but it hung
    Rather too high and distant; that she threw
      Her glances on it, and then, longing, flung
    Stones and whatever she could pick up, to
      Bring down the fruit, which still perversely clung
    To its own bough, and dangled yet in sight,
    But always at a most provoking height;[ha]

                      LXXVII.

    That on a sudden, when she least had hope,
      It fell down of its own accord before
    Her feet; that her first movement was to stoop
      And pick it up, and bite it to the core;
    That just as her young lip began to ope[hb]
      Upon the golden fruit the vision bore,
    A bee flew out, and stung her to the heart,
    And so--she woke with a great scream and start.

                      LXXVIII.

    All this she told with some confusion and
      Dismay, the usual consequence of dreams
    Of the unpleasant kind, with none at hand
      To expound their vain and visionary gleams.
    I've known some odd ones which seemed really planned
      Prophetically, or that which one deems
    A "strange coincidence," to use a phrase
    By which such things are settled now-a-days.[355]

                      LXXIX.

    The damsels, who had thoughts of some great harm,
      Began, as is the consequence of fear,
    To scold a little at the false alarm
      That broke for nothing on their sleeping ear.
    The matron, too, was wroth to leave her warm
      Bed for the dream she had been obliged to hear,
    And chafed at poor Dudù, who only sighed,
    And said, that she was sorry she had cried.

                      LXXX.

    "I've heard of stories of a cock and bull;
      But visions of an apple and a bee,
    To take us from our natural rest, and pull
      The whole Oda from their beds at half-past three,
    Would make us think the moon is at its full.
      You surely are unwell, child! we must see,
    To-morrow, what his Highness's physician
    Will say to this hysteric of a vision.

                      LXXXI.

    "And poor Juanna, too, the child's first night
      Within these walls, to be broke in upon
    With such a clamour--I had thought it right
      That the young stranger should not lie alone,
    And, as the quietest of all, she might
      With you, Dudù, a good night's rest have known:
    But now I must transfer her to the charge
    Of Lolah--though her couch is not so large."

                      LXXXII.

    Lolah's eyes sparkled at the proposition;
      But poor Dudù, with large drops in her own,
    Resulting from the scolding or the vision,
      Implored that present pardon might be shown
    For this first fault, and that on no condition
      (She added in a soft and piteous tone)
    Juanna should be taken from her, and
    Her future dreams should be all kept in hand.

                      LXXXIII.

    She promised never more to have a dream,
      At least to dream so loudly as just now;
    She wondered at herself how she could scream--
      'T was foolish, nervous, as she must allow,
    A fond hallucination, and a theme
      For laughter--but she felt her spirits low,
    And begged they would excuse her; she'd get over
    This weakness in a few hours, and recover.

                      LXXXIV.

    And here Juanna kindly interposed,
      And said she felt herself extremely well
    Where she then was, as her sound sleep disclosed,
      When all around rang like a tocsin bell;
    She did not find herself the least disposed
      To quit her gentle partner, and to dwell
    Apart from one who had no sin to show,
    Save that of dreaming once "mal-à-propos."

                      LXXXV.

    As thus Juanna spoke, Dudù turned round
      And hid her face within Juanna's breast:
    Her neck alone was seen, but that was found
      The colour of a budding rose's crest.[hc]
    I can't tell why she blushed, nor can expound
      The mystery of this rupture of their test;
    All that I know is, that the facts I state
    Are true as Truth has ever been of late,

                      LXXXVI.

    And so good night to them,--or, if you will,
      Good morrow--for the cock had crown, and light
    Began to clothe each Asiatic hill,
      And the mosque crescent struggled into sight
    Of the long caravan, which in the chill
      Of dewy dawn wound slowly round each height
    That stretches to the stony belt, which girds
    Asia, where Kaff looks down upon the Kurds.[356]

                      LXXXVII.

    With the first ray, or rather grey of morn,
      Gulbeyaz rose from restlessness; and pale
    As Passion rises, with its bosom worn,
      Arrayed herself with mantle, gem, and veil.
    The Nightingale that sings with the deep thorn,
      Which fable places in her breast of wail,
    Is lighter far of heart and voice than those
    Whose headlong passions form their proper woes.

                      LXXXVIII.

    And that's the moral of this composition,
      If people would but see its real drift;--
    But _that_ they will not do without suspicion,
      Because all gentle readers have the gift
    Of closing 'gainst the light their orbs of vision:
      While gentle writers also love to lift
    Their voices 'gainst each other, which is natural,
    The numbers are too great for them to flatter all.

                      LXXXIX.

    Rose the Sultana from a bed of splendour,
      Softer than the soft Sybarite's, who cried[357]
    Aloud because his feelings were too tender
      To brook a ruffled rose-leaf by his side,--
    So beautiful that Art could little mend her,
      Though pale with conflicts between Love and Pride;--
    So agitated was she with her error,
    She did not even look into the mirror.

                      XC.

    Also arose about the self-same time,
      Perhaps a little later, her great Lord,
    Master of thirty kingdoms so sublime,
      And of a wife by whom he was abhorred;
    A thing of much less import in that clime--
      At least to those of incomes which afford
    The filling up their whole connubial cargo--
    Than where two wives are under an embargo.

                      XCI.

    He did not think much on the matter, nor
      Indeed on any other: as a man
    He liked to have a handsome paramour
      At hand, as one may like to have a fan,
    And therefore of Circassians had good store,
      As an amusement after the Divan;
    Though an unusual fit of love, or duty,
    Had made him lately bask in his bride's beauty.

                      XCII.

    And now he rose; and after due ablutions
      Exacted by the customs of the East,
    And prayers and other pious evolutions,
      He drank six cups of coffee at the least,
    And then withdrew to hear about the Russians,
      Whose victories had recently increased
    In Catherine's reign, whom Glory still adores,
    As greatest of all sovereigns and w----s.

                      XCIII.

    But oh, thou grand legitimate Alexander![hd][358]
      Her son's son, let not this last phrase offend
    Thine ear, if it should reach--and now rhymes wander
      Almost as far as Petersburgh, and lend
    A dreadful impulse to each loud meander
      Of murmuring Liberty's wide waves, which blend
    Their roar even with the Baltic's--so you be
    Your father's son, 't is quite enough for me.

                      XCIV.

    To call men love-begotten, or proclaim[he]
      Their mothers as the antipodes of Timon,
    That hater of Mankind, would be a shame,
      A libel, or whate'er you please to rhyme on:
    But people's ancestors are History's game;[hf]
      And if one Lady's slip could leave a crime on
    All generations, I should like to know
    What pedigree the best would have to show?[359]

                      XCV.

    Had Catherine and the Sultan understood
      Their own true interests, which Kings rarely know,
    Until 't is taught by lessons rather rude,
      There was a way to end their strife, although
    Perhaps precarious, had they but thought good,
      Without the aid of Prince or Plenipo:
    She to dismiss her guards and he his Harem,
    And for their other matters, meet and share 'em.

                      XCVI.

    But as it was, his Highness had to hold
      His daily council upon ways and means
    How to encounter with this martial scold,
      This modern Amazon and Queen of queans;
    And the perplexity could not be told
      Of all the pillars of the State, which leans
    Sometimes a little heavy on the backs
    Of those who cannot lay on a new tax.

                      XCVII.

    Meantime Gulbeyaz when her King was gone,
      Retired into her boudoir, a sweet place
    For love or breakfast; private, pleasing, lone,
      And rich with all contrivances which grace
    Those gay recesses:--many a precious stone
      Sparkled along its roof, and many a vase
    Of porcelain held in the fettered flowers,
    Those captive soothers of a captive's hours.

                      XCVIII.

    Mother of pearl, and porphyry, and marble,
      Vied with each other on this costly spot;
    And singing birds without were heard to warble;
      And the stained glass which lighted this fair grot
    Varied each ray;--but all descriptions garble
      The true effect,[360] and so we had better not
    Be too minute; an outline is the best,--
    A lively reader's fancy does the rest.

                      XCIX.

    And here she summoned Baba, and required
      Don Juan at his hands, and information
    Of what had passed since all the slaves retired,
      And whether he had occupied their station:
    If matters had been managed as desired,
      And his disguise with due consideration
    Kept up; and above all, the where and how
    He had passed the night, was what she wished to know.

                      C.

    Baba, with some embarrassment, replied
      To this long catechism of questions, asked
    More easily than answered,--that he had tried
      His best to obey in what he had been tasked;
    But there seemed something that he wished to hide,
      Which Hesitation more betrayed than masked;
    He scratched his ear, the infallible resource
    To which embarrassed people have recourse.

                      CI.

    Gulbeyaz was no model of true patience,
      Nor much disposed to wait in word or deed;
    She liked quick answers in all conversations;
      And when she saw him stumbling like a steed
    In his replies, she puzzled him for fresh ones;
      And as his speech grew still more broken-kneed,
    Her cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,
    And her proud brow's blue veins to swell and darkle.

                      CII.

    When Baba saw these symptoms, which he knew
      To bode him no great good, he deprecated
    Her anger, and beseeched she'd hear him through--
      He could not help the thing which he related:
    Then out it came at length, that to Dudù
      Juan was given in charge, as hath been stated;
    But not by Baba's fault, he said, and swore on
    The holy camel's hump, besides the Koran.

                      CIII.

    The chief dame of the Oda,[361] upon whom
      The discipline of the whole Harem bore,
    As soon as they re-entered their own room,
      For Baba's function stopped short at the door,
    Had settled all; nor could he then presume
      (The aforesaid Baba) just then to do more,
    Without exciting such suspicion as
    Might make the matter still worse than it was.

                      CIV.

    He hoped, indeed he thought, he could be sure,
      Juan had not betrayed himself; in fact
    'T was certain that his conduct had been pure,
      Because a foolish or imprudent act
    Would not alone have made him insecure,
      But ended in his being found out and _sacked,_
    And thrown into the sea.--Thus Baba spoke
    Of all save Dudù's dream, which was no joke.

                      CV.

    This he discreetly kept in the back ground,
      And talked away--and might have talked till now,
    For any further answer that he found,
      So deep an anguish wrung Gulbeyaz' brow:
    Her cheek turned ashes, ears rung, brain whirled round,
      As if she had received a sudden blow,
    And the heart's dew of pain sprang fast and chilly
    O'er her fair front, like Morning's on a lily.

                      CVI.

    Although she was not of the fainting sort,
      Baba thought she would faint, but there he erred--
    It was but a convulsion, which though short
      Can never be described; we all have heard,[hg]
    And some of us have felt thus "_all amort_"[362]
      When things beyond the common have occurred;--
    Gulbeyaz proved in that brief agony
    What she could ne'er express--then how should I?

                      CVII.

    She stood a moment as a Pythoness
      Stands on her tripod, agonized, and full
    Of inspiration gathered from distress,
      When all the heart-strings like wild horses pull
    The heart asunder;--then, as more or less
      Their speed abated or their strength grew dull,
    She sunk down on her seat by slow degrees,
    And bowed her throbbing head o'er trembling knees.

                      CVIII.

    Her face declined and was unseen; her hair
      Fell in long tresses like the weeping willow,
    Sweeping the marble underneath her chair,
      Or rather sofa (for it was all pillow,
    A low, soft ottoman), and black Despair
      Stirred up and down her bosom like a billow,
    Which rushes to some shore whose shingles check
    Its farther course, but must receive its wreck.

                      CIX.

    Her head hung down, and her long hair in stooping
      Concealed her features better than a veil;
    And one hand o'er the ottoman lay drooping,
      White, waxen, and as alabaster pale:
    Would that I were a painter! to be grouping
      All that a poet drags into detail!
    Oh that my words were colours! but their tints
    May serve perhaps as outlines or slight hints.

                      CX.

    Baba, who knew by experience when to talk
      And when to hold his tongue, now held it till
    This passion might blow o'er, nor dared to balk
      Gulbeyaz' taciturn or speaking will.
    At length she rose up, and began to walk
      Slowly along the room, but silent still,
    And her brow cleared, but not her troubled eye;
    The wind was down, but still the sea ran high.

                      CXI.

    She stopped, and raised her head to speak-but paused
      And then moved on again with rapid pace;
    Then slackened it, which is the march most caused
      By deep emotion:--you may sometimes trace
    A feeling in each footstep, as disclosed
      By Sallust in his Catiline, who, chased
    By all the demons of all passions, showed
    Their work even by the way in which he trode[363].

                      CXII.

    Gulbeyaz stopped and beckoned Baba:--"Slave!
      Bring the two slaves!" she said in a low tone,
    But one which Baba did not like to brave,
      And yet he shuddered, and seemed rather prone
    To prove reluctant, and begged leave to crave
      (Though he well knew the meaning) to be shown
    What slaves her Highness wished to indicate,
    For fear of any error, like the late.

                      CXIII.

    "The Georgian and her paramour," replied
      The Imperial Bride--and added, "Let the boat
    Be ready by the secret portal's side:
      You know the rest." The words stuck in her throat,
    Despite her injured love and fiery pride;
      And of this Baba willingly took note,
    And begged by every hair of Mahomet's beard,
    She would revoke the order he had heard.

                      CXIV.

    "To hear is to obey," he said; "but still,
      Sultana, think upon the consequence:
    It is not that I shall not all fulfil
      Your orders, even in their severest sense;
    But such precipitation may end ill,
      Even at your own imperative expense:
    I do not mean destruction and exposure,
    In case of any premature disclosure;

                      CXV.

    "But your own feelings. Even should all the rest
      Be hidden by the rolling waves, which hide
    Already many a once love-beaten breast
      Deep in the caverns of the deadly tide--
    You love this boyish, new, Seraglio guest,
      And if this violent remedy be tried--
    Excuse my freedom, when I here assure you,
    That killing him is not the way to cure you."

                      CXVI.

    "What dost thou know of Love or feeling?--Wretch!
      Begone!" she cried, with kindling eyes--"and do
    My bidding!" Baba vanished, for to stretch
      His own remonstrance further he well knew
    Might end in acting as his own "Jack Ketch;"
      And though he wished extremely to get through
    This awkward business without harm to others,
    He still preferred his own neck to another's.

                      CXVII.

    Away he went then upon his commission,
      Growling and grumbling in good Turkish phrase
    Against all women of whate'er condition,
      Especially Sultanas and their ways;
    Their obstinacy, pride, and indecision,
      Their never knowing their own mind two days,
    The trouble that they gave, their immorality,
    Which made him daily bless his own neutrality.

                      CXVIII.

    And then he called his brethren to his aid,
      And sent one on a summons to the pair,
    That they must instantly be well arrayed,
      And above all be combed even to a hair,
    And brought before the Empress, who had made
      Inquiries after them with kindest care:
    At which Dudù looked strange, and Juan silly;
    But go they must at once, and will I--nill I.

                      CXIX.

    And here I leave them at their preparation
      For the imperial presence, wherein whether
    Gulbeyaz showed them both commiseration,
      Or got rid of the parties altogether,
    Like other angry ladies of her nation,--
      Are things the turning of a hair or feather
    May settle; but far be 't from me to anticipate
    In what way feminine caprice may dissipate.

                      CXX.

    I leave them for the present with good wishes,
      Though doubts of their well doing, to arrange
    Another part of History; for the dishes
      Of this our banquet we must sometimes change;
    And trusting Juan may escape the fishes,
      (Although his situation now seems strange,
    And scarce secure),--as such digressions _are_ fair,
    The Muse will take a little touch at warfare.

End of Canto 6th.

[339] [The comparison of Queen Caroline to snow may be traced to an
article in the _Times_ of August 23, 1820: "The Queen may now, we
believe, be considered as triumphing! For the first three years at least
of her Majesty's painful peregrinations, she stands before her husband's
admiring subjects 'as white as unsunned snows.'" Political bards and
lampoonists of the king's party thanked the _Times_ for "giving them
that word."]

{276}[340] [According to Gronow (_Reminiscences_, 1889, i. 62), a
practical joke of Dan Mackinnon's (_vide ante_, p. 69, _footnote_) gave
Byron a hint for this scene in the harem: "Lord Wellington was curious
about visiting a convent near Lisbon, and the lady abbess made no
difficulty. Mackinnon hearing this contrived to get clandestinely within
the sacred walls ... at all events, when Lord Wellington arrived Dan
Mackinnon was to be seen among the nuns, dressed out in their sacred
costume, with his whiskers shaved; and, as he possessed good features,
he was declared to be one of the best-looking among those chaste dames.
It was supposed that this adventure, which was known to Lord Byron,
suggested a similar episode in _Don Juan_."]

Circassians who were presented for sale to Nicolas Ernest Kleeman (see
his _Voyage de Vienne, etc._, 1780, pp. 142, 143) at Kaffa, in the
Crimea. Of the first he writes, "Elle me baisa la main, et par l'ordre
de son maître, elle se promena en long et en large, pour me faire
remarquer sa taille mince et aisée. Elle avoit un joli petit pied....
Quand elle a en ôté son voile elle a présenté à mes yeux une beauté
très-attrayante; ses cheveux étoient blonds argentés; elle avoit de
grands yeux bleux, le nez un peu long, et les lèvres appétissantes. Sa
figure étoit régulière, son teint blanc, délicat, les joues couvertes
d'un charmant vermilion.... La seconde étoit un peu petite, assez
grasse, et avoit les cheveux roux, l'air sensuel et revenant." Kleeman
pretended to offer terms, took notes, and retired. But the Circassians
are before us still.]

the Countess Guiccioli endeavoured to break the announcement of
Allegra's death (April, 1822). "'I understand,' said he; 'it is enough;
say no more.' A mortal paleness spread itself over his face, his
strength failed him, and he sunk into a seat. His look was fixed, and

    O LOVE! O Glory! what are ye who fly

    There's not a meteor in the polar sky

      If this be the right reading--'t is no matter;
    The fact's about the same, I am secure;

    A town which did a famous siege endure,

    The fortress is called Ismail, and is placed
      Upon the Danube's left branch and left bank,[370]
    With buildings in the Oriental taste,
      But still a fortress of the foremost rank,
    Or was at least, unless 't is since defaced,
      Which with your conquerors is a common prank:
    It stands some eighty versts from the high sea,
    And measures round of toises thousands three.[371]

                      X.

    Within the extent of this fortification
      A borough is comprised along the height
    Upon the left, which from its loftier station
      Commands the city, and upon its site
    A Greek had raised around this elevation
      A quantity of palisades _upright_,
    So placed as to _impede_ the fire of those
    Who held the place, and to _assist_ the foe's.[372]

                      XI.

    This circumstance may serve to give a notion
      Of the high talents of this new Vauban:
    But the town ditch below was deep as Ocean,
      The rampart higher than you'd wish to hang:
    But then there was a great want of precaution
      (Prithee, excuse this engineering slang),
    Nor work advanced, nor covered way was there,[373]
    To hint, at least, "Here is no thoroughfare."

                      XII.

    But a stone bastion, with a narrow gorge,
      And walls as thick as most skulls born as yet;
    Two batteries, cap-à-pie, as our St. George,
      Casemated[374] one, and t' other "a barbette,"[375]
    Of Danube's bank took formidable charge;
      While two-and-twenty cannon duly set
    Rose over the town's right side, in bristling tier,
    Forty feet high, upon a cavalier.[376]

                      XIII.

    But from the river the town's open quite,
      Because the Turks could never be persuaded
    A Russian vessel e'er would heave in sight;[377]
      And such their creed was till they were invaded,
    When it grew rather late to set things right:
      But as the Danube could not well be waded,
    They looked upon the Muscovite flotilla,
    And only shouted, "Allah!" and "Bis Millah!"

                      XIV.

    The Russians now were ready to attack;
      But oh, ye goddesses of War and Glory!
    How shall I spell the name of each Cossacque
      Who were immortal, could one tell their story?
    Alas! what to their memory can lack?
      Achilles' self was not more grim and gory
    Than thousands of this new and polished nation,
    Whose names want nothing but--pronunciation.

                      XV.

    Still I'll record a few, if but to increase
      Our euphony: there was Strongenoff, and Strokonoff,
    Meknop, Serge Lwow, Arséniew of modern Greece,
      And Tschitsshakoff, and Roguenoff, and Chokenoff,[378]
    And others of twelve consonants apiece;
      And more might be found out, if I could poke enough
    Into gazettes; but Fame (capricious strumpet),
    It seems, has got an ear as well as trumpet,

                      XVI.

    And cannot tune those discords of narration,[hk]
      Which may be names at Moscow, into rhyme;
    Yet there were several worth commemoration,
      As e'er was virgin of a nuptial chime;
    Soft words, too, fitted for the peroration
      Of Londonderry drawling against time,
    Ending in "ischskin," "ousckin," "iffskchy," "ouski,"
    Of whom we can insert but Rousamouski,[379]

                      XVII.

    Scherematoff and Chrematoff, Koklophti,
      Koclobski, Kourakin, and Mouskin Pouskin,
    All proper men of weapons, as e'er scoffed high[380]
      Against a foe, or ran a sabre through skin:
    Little cared they for Mahomet or Mufti,
      Unless to make their kettle-drums a new skin
    Out of their hides, if parchment had grown dear,
    And no more handy substitute been near.

                      XVIII.

    Then there were foreigners of much renown,
      Of various nations, and all volunteers;
    Not fighting for their country or its crown,
      But wishing to be one day brigadiers;
    Also to have the sacking of a town;--
      A pleasant thing to young men at their years.
    'Mongst them were several Englishmen of pith,
    Sixteen called Thomson, and nineteen named Smith.

                      XIX.

    Jack Thomson and Bill Thomson;--all the rest
      Had been called _"Jemmy,"_ after the great bard;
    I don't know whether they had arms or crest,
      But such a godfather's as good a card.
    Three of the Smiths were Peters; but the best
      Amongst them all, hard blows to inflict or ward,
    Was _he_, since so renowned "in country quarters
    At Halifax;"[381] but now he served the Tartars.

                      XX.

    The rest were Jacks and Gills and Wills and Bills,
      But when I've added that the elder Jack Smith
    Was born in Cumberland among the hills,
      And that his father was an honest blacksmith,
    I've said all _I_ know of a name that fills
      Three lines of the despatch in taking "Schmacksmith,"
    A village of Moldavia's waste, wherein
    He fell, immortal in a bulletin.

                      XXI.

    I wonder (although Mars no doubt's a god I
      Praise) if a man's name in a _bulletin_
    May make up for a _bullet in_ his body?
      I hope this little question is no sin,
    Because, though I am but a simple noddy,
      I think one Shakespeare puts the same thought in
    The mouth of some one in his plays so doting,
    Which many people pass for wits by quoting.[382]

                      XXII.

    Then there were Frenchmen, gallant, young, and gay;
      But I'm too great a patriot to record
    Their Gallic names upon a glorious day;
      I'd rather tell ten lies than say a word
    Of truth;--such truths are treason; they betray
      Their country; and as traitors are abhorred,
    Who name the French in English, save to show
    How Peace should make John Bull the Frenchman's foe.

                      XXIII.

    The Russians, having built two batteries on
      An isle near Ismail, had two ends in view;
    The first was to bombard it, and knock down
      The public buildings and the private too,
    No matter what poor souls might be undone:[hl]
      The city's shape suggested this, 't is true,
    Formed like an amphitheatre--each dwelling
    Presented a fine mark to throw a shell in.[383]

                      XXIV.

    The second object was to profit by
      The moment of the general consternation,
    To attack the Turk's flotilla, which lay nigh
      Extremely tranquil, anchored at its station:
    But a third motive was as probably
      To frighten them into capitulation;[384]
    A phantasy which sometimes seizes warriors,
    Unless they are game as bull-dogs and fox-terriers.[hm]

                      XXV.

    A habit rather blameable, which is
      That of despising those we combat with,
    Common in many cases, was in this
      The cause[385] of killing Tchitchitzkoff and Smith--
    One of the valorous "Smiths" whom we shall miss
      Out of those nineteen who late rhymed to "pith;"
    But 't is a name so spread o'er "Sir" and "Madam,"
    That one would think the _first_ who bore it _"Adam."_

                      XXVI.

    The Russian batteries were incomplete,
      Because they were constructed in a hurry;[386]
    Thus the same cause which makes a verse want feet,
      And throws a cloud o'er Longman and John Murray,
    When the sale of new books is not so fleet
      As they who print them think is necessary,
    May likewise put off for a time what story
    Sometimes calls "Murder," and at others "Glory."

                      XXVII.

    Whether it was their engineer's stupidity,
      Their haste or waste, I neither know nor care,
    Or some contractor's personal cupidity,
      Saving his soul by cheating in the ware
    Of homicide, but there was no solidity
      In the new batteries erected there;
    They either missed, or they were never missed,
    And added greatly to the missing list.

                      XXVIII.

    A sad miscalculation about distance
      Made all their naval matters incorrect;
    Three fireships lost their amiable existence
      Before they reached a spot to take effect;
    The match was lit too soon, and no assistance
      Could remedy this lubberly defect;
    They blew up in the middle of the river,
    While, though 't was dawn, the Turks slept fast as ever.[387]

                      XXIX.

    At seven they rose, however, and surveyed
      The Russ flotilla getting under way;
    'T was nine, when still advancing undismayed,
      Within a cable's length their vessels lay
    Off Ismail, and commenced a cannonade,
      Which was returned with interest, I may say,
    And by a fire of musketry and grape,
    And shells and shot of every size and shape.[388]

                      XXX.

    For six hours bore they without intermission
      The Turkish fire, and, aided by their own
    Land batteries, worked their guns with great precision;
      At length they found mere cannonade alone
    By no means would produce the town's submission,
      And made a signal to retreat at one.
    One bark blew up, a second near the works
    Running aground, was taken by the Turks.[389]

                      XXXI.

    The Moslem, too, had lost both ships and men;
      But when they saw the enemy retire,
    Their Delhis[390] manned some boats, and sailed again,
      And galled the Russians with a heavy fire,
    And tried to make a landing on the main;
      But here the effect fell short of their desire:
    Count Damas drove them back into the water
    Pell-mell, and with a whole gazette of slaughter.[391]

                      XXXII.

    "If" (says the historian here) "I could report
      All that the Russians did upon this day,
    I think that several volumes would fall short,
      And I should still have many things to say;"[392]
    And so he says no more--but pays his court
      To some distinguished strangers in that fray;
    The Prince de Ligne, and Langeron, and Damas,
    Names great as any that the roll of Fame has.[393]

                      XXXIII.

    This being the case, may show us what Fame _is_:
      For out of these three "_preux Chevaliers_," how
    Many of common readers give a guess
      That such existed? (and they may live now
    For aught we know.) Renown's all hit or miss;
      There's fortune even in Fame, we must allow.
    'T is true, the Memoirs of the Prince de Ligne[394]
    Have half withdrawn from _him_ Oblivion's screen.

                      XXXIV.

    But here are men who fought in gallant actions
      As gallantly as ever heroes fought,
    But buried in the heap of such transactions
      Their names are rarely found, nor often sought.
    Thus even good fame may suffer sad contractions,
      And is extinguished sooner than she ought:
    Of all our modern battles, I will bet
    You can't repeat nine names from each Gazette.

                      XXXV.

    In short, this last attack, though rich in glory,
      Showed that _somewhere, somehow_, there was a fault,
    And Admiral Ribas[395] (known in Russian story)
      Most strongly recommended an assault;
    In which he was opposed by young and hoary,
      Which made a long debate; but I must halt,
    For if I wrote down every warrior's speech,
    I doubt few readers e'er would mount the breach.

                      XXXVI.

    There was a man, if that he was a man,
      Not that his manhood could be called in question,
    For had he not been Hercules, his span
      Had been as short in youth as indigestion
    Made his last illness, when, all worn and wan,
      He died beneath a tree, as much unblest on
    The soil of the green province he had wasted,
    As e'er was locust on the land it blasted.

                      XXXVII.

    This was Potemkin[396]--a great thing in days
      When homicide and harlotry made great;
    If stars and titles could entail long praise,
      His glory might half equal his estate.
    This fellow, being six foot high, could raise
      A kind of phantasy proportionate
    In the then Sovereign of the Russian people,
    Who measured men as you would do a steeple.

                      XXXVIII.

    While things were in abeyance, Ribas sent
      A courier to the Prince, and he succeeded
    In ordering matters after his own bent;
      I cannot tell the way in which he pleaded,
    But shortly he had cause to be content.
      In the mean time, the batteries proceeded,
    And fourscore cannon on the Danube's border
    Were briskly fired and answered in due order.[397]

                      XXXIX.

    But on the thirteenth, when already part
      Of the troops were embarked, the siege to raise,
    A courier on the spur inspired new heart
      Into all panters for newspaper praise,[hn]
    As well as dilettanti in War's art,
      By his despatches (couched in pithy phrase)
    Announcing the appointment of that lover of
    Battles to the command, Field-Marshal Souvaroff.[398]

                      XL.

    The letter of the Prince to the same Marshal
      Was worthy of a Spartan, had the cause
    Been one to which a good heart could be partial--
      Defence of freedom, country, or of laws;
    But as it was mere lust of Power to o'er-arch all
      With its proud brow, it merits slight applause,
    Save for its style, which said, all in a trice,
    "You will take Ismail at whatever price."[399]

                      XLI.

    "Let there be Light! said God, and there was Light!"
      "Let there be Blood!" says man, and there's a sea!
    The fiat of this spoiled child of the Night
      (For Day ne'er saw his merits) could decree
    More evil in an hour, than thirty bright
      Summers could renovate, though they should be
    Lovely as those which ripened Eden's fruit;
    For War cuts up not only branch, but root.

                      XLII.

    Our friends, the Turks, who with loud "Allahs" now
      Began to signalise the Russ retreat,[400]
    Were damnably mistaken; few are slow
      In thinking that their enemy is beat,[401]
    (Or _beaten_, if you insist on grammar, though
      I never think about it in a heat,)
    But here I say the Turks were much mistaken,
    Who hating hogs, yet wished to save their bacon.

                      XLIII.

    For, on the sixteenth, at full gallop, drew
      In sight two horsemen, who were deemed Cossacques
    For some time, till they came in nearer view:
      They had but little baggage at their backs,
    For there were but _three_ shirts between the two;
      But on they rode upon two Ukraine hacks,
    Till, in approaching, were at length descried
    In this plain pair, Suwarrow and his guide.[402]

                      XLIV.

    "Great joy to London now!" says some great fool,
      When London had a grand illumination,
    Which to that bottle-conjuror, John Bull,
      Is of all dreams the first hallucination;
    So that the streets of coloured lamps are full,
      That sage (said John) surrenders at discretion[ho]
    His purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense,
    To gratify, like a huge moth, this _one_ sense.

                      XLV.

    'T is strange that he should further "Damn his eyes,"
      For they are damned; that once all-famous oath
    Is to the Devil now no further prize,
      Since John has lately lost the use of both.
    Debt he calls Wealth, and taxes Paradise;
      And Famine, with her gaunt and bony growth,
    Which stare him in the face, he won't examine,
    Or swears that Ceres hath begotten Famine.

                      XLVI.

    But to the tale;--great joy unto the camp!
      To Russian, Tartar, English, French, Cossacque,
    O'er whom Suwarrow shone like a gas lamp,
      Presaging a most luminous attack;
    Or like a wisp along the marsh so damp,
      Which leads beholders on a boggy walk,
    He flitted to and fro a dancing light,
    Which all who saw it followed, wrong or right.

                      XLVII.

    But, certes, matters took a different face;
      There was enthusiasm and much applause,
    The fleet and camp saluted with great grace,
      And all presaged good fortune to their cause.
    Within a cannot-shot length of the place
      They drew, constructed ladders, repaired flaws
    In former works, made new, prepared fascines,
    And all kinds of benevolent machines.

                      XLVIII.

    'T is thus the spirit of a single mind
      Makes that of multitudes take one direction,
    As roll the waters to the breathing wind,
      Or roams the herd beneath the bull's protection;
    Or as a little dog will lead the blind,
      Or a bell-wether form the flock's connection
    By tinkling sounds, when they go forth to victual;
    Such is the sway of your great men o'er little.

                      XLIX.

    The whole camp rung with joy; you would have thought
      That they were going to a marriage feast
    (This metaphor, I think, holds good as aught,
      Since there is discord after both at least):
    There was not now a luggage boy but sought
      Danger and spoil with ardour much increased;
    And why? because a little--odd--old man,
    Stripped to his shirt, was come to lead the van.

                      L.

    But so it was; and every preparation
      Was made with all alacrity: the first
    Detachment of three columns took its station,
      And waited but the signal's voice to burst
    Upon the foe: the second's ordination
      Was also in three columns, with a thirst
    For Glory gaping o'er a sea of Slaughter:
    The third, in columns two, attacked by water.[403]

                      LI.

    New batteries were erected, and was held
      A general council, in which Unanimity,
    That stranger to most councils, here prevailed,[404]
      As sometimes happens in a great extremity;[hp]
    And every difficulty being dispelled,
      Glory began to dawn with due sublimity,[hq]
    While Souvaroff, determined to obtain it,
    Was teaching his recruits to use the bayonet.[405]

                      LII.

    It is an actual fact, that he, commander
      In chief, in proper person deigned to drill
    The awkward squad, and could afford to squander
      His time, a corporal's duty to fulfil;
    Just as you'd break a sucking salamander
      To swallow flame, and never take it ill:[hr]
    He showed them how to mount a ladder (which
    Was not like Jacob's) or to cross a ditch.[406]

                      LIII.

    Also he dressed up, for the nonce, fascines
      Like men with turbans, scimitars, and dirks,
    And made them charge with bayonet these machines,
      By way of lesson against actual Turks;[407]
    And when well practised in these mimic scenes,
      He judged them proper to assail the works,--
    (At which your wise men sneered in phrases witty),[hs]
    He made no answer--but he took the city.

                      LIV.

    Most things were in this posture on the eve
      Of the assault, and all the camp was in
    A stern repose; which you would scarce conceive;
      Yet men resolved to dash through thick and thin
    Are very silent when they once believe
      That all is settled:--there was little din,
    For some were thinking of their home and friends,
    And others of themselves and latter ends.[ht]

                      LV.

    Suwarrow chiefly was on the alert,
      Surveying, drilling, ordering, jesting, pondering;
    For the man was, we safely may assert,
      A thing to wonder at beyond most wondering;
    Hero, buffoon, half-demon, and half-dirt,
      Praying, instructing, desolating, plundering--Now
    Mars, now Momus--and when bent to storm
    A fortress, Harlequin in uniform.[408]

                      LVI.

    The day before the assault, while upon drill--
      For this great conqueror played the corporal--
    Some Cossacques, hovering like hawks round a hill,
      Had met a party towards the Twilight's fall,
    One of whom spoke their tongue--or well or ill,
      'T was much that he was understood at all;
    But whether from his voice, or speech, or manner,
    They found that he had fought beneath their banner.

                      LVII.

    Whereon immediately at his request
      They brought him and his comrades to head-quarters;
    Their dress was Moslem, but you might have guessed
      That these were merely masquerading Tartars,
    And that beneath each Turkish-fashioned vest
      Lurked Christianity--which sometimes barters
    Her inward grace for outward show, and makes
    It difficult to shun some strange mistakes.

                      LVIII.

    Suwarrow, who was standing in his shirt
      Before a company of Calmucks, drilling,
    Exclaiming, fooling, swearing at the inert,
      And lecturing on the noble art of killing,--
    For deeming human clay but common dirt
      This great philosopher was thus instilling
    His maxims,[409] which to martial comprehension
    Proved death in battle equal to a pension;--

                      LIX.

    Suwarrow, when he saw this company
      Of Cossacques and their prey, turned round and cast
    Upon them his slow brow and piercing eye:--
      "Whence come ye?"--"From Constantinople last,
    Captives just now escaped," was the reply.
      "What are ye?"--"What you see us." Briefly passed
    This dialogue; for he who answered knew
    To whom he spoke, and made his words but few.

                      LX.

    "Your names?"--"Mine's Johnson, and my comrade's Juan;
      The other two are women, and the third
    Is neither man nor woman." The Chief threw on
      The party a slight glance, then said," I have heard
    _Your_ name before, the second is a new one:
      To bring the other three here was absurd:
    But let that pass:--I think I have heard your name
    In the Nikolaiew regiment?"--"The same."

                      LXI.

    "You served at Widdin?"--"Yes."--"You led the attack?"
      "I did."--"What next?"--"I really hardly know"--
    "You were the first i' the breach?"--"I was not slack
      At least to follow those who might be so"--"What
    followed?"--"A shot laid me on my back,
      And I became a prisoner to the foe"--
    "You shall have vengeance, for the town surrounded
    Is twice as strong as that where you were wounded.

                      LXII.

    "Where will you serve?"--"Where'er you please."--"I know
      You like to be the hope of the forlorn,
    And doubtless would be foremost on the foe
      After the hardships you've already borne.
    And this young fellow--say what can he do?
      He with the beardless chin and garments torn?"--
    "Why, General, if he hath no greater fault
    In War than Love, he had better lead the assault"--

                      LXIII.

    "He shall if that he dare." Here Juan bowed
      Low as the compliment deserved. Suwarrow
    Continued: "Your old regiment's allowed,
      By special providence, to lead to-morrow,
    Or, it may be, to-night, the assault: I have vowed
      To several Saints, that shortly plough or harrow
    Shall pass o'er what was Ismail, and its tusk[410]
    Be unimpeded by the proudest mosque.

                      LXIV.

    "So now, my lads, for Glory!"--Here he turned
      And drilled away in the most classic Russian,
    Until each high heroic bosom burned
      For cash and conquest, as if from a cushion
    A preacher had held forth (who nobly spurned
      All earthly goods save tithes) and bade them push on
    To slay the Pagans who resisted, battering
    The armies of the Christian Empress Catherine.

                      LXV.

    Johnson, who knew by this long colloquy
      Himself a favourite, ventured to address
    Suwarrow, though engaged with accents high
      In his resumed amusement. "I confess
    My debt in being thus allowed to die
      Among the foremost; but if you'd express
    Explicitly our several posts, my friend
    And self would know what duty to attend."

                      LXVI.

    "Right! I was busy, and forgot. Why, you
      Will join your former regiment, which should be
    Now under arms. Ho! Katskoff, take him to"--
      (Here he called up a Polish orderly)
    "His post, I mean the regiment Nikolaiew:
      The stranger stripling may remain with me;
    He's a fine boy. The women may be sent
    To the other baggage, or to the sick tent."

                      LXVII.

    But here a sort of scene began to ensue:
      The ladies,--who by no means had been bred
    To be disposed of in a way so new,
      Although their Harem education led,
    Doubtless, to that of doctrines the most true,
      Passive obedience,--now raised up the head
    With flashing eyes and starting tears, and flung
    Their arms, as hens their wings about their young,

                      LXVIII.

    O'er the promoted couple of brave men
      Who were thus honoured by the greatest Chief
    That ever peopled Hell with heroes slain,
      Or plunged a province or a realm in grief.
    Oh, foolish mortals! Always taught in vain!
      Oh, glorious Laurel! since for one sole leaf
    Of thine imaginary deathless tree,
    Of blood and tears must flow the unebbing sea.[hu]

                      LXIX.

    Suwarrow, who had small regard for tears,
      And not much sympathy for blood, surveyed
    The women with their hair about their ears
      And natural agonies, with a slight shade
    Of feeling: for however Habit sears
      Men's hearts against whole millions, when their trade
    Is butchery, sometimes a single sorrow
    Will touch even heroes--and such was Suwarrow.

                      LXX.

    He said,--and in the kindest Calmuck tone,--
      "Why, Johnson, what the devil do you mean
    By bringing women here? They shall be shown
      All the attention possible, and seen
    In safety to the waggons, where alone
      In fact they can be safe. You should have been
    Aware this kind of baggage never thrives;
    Save wed a year, I hate recruits with wives"--

                      LXXI.

    "May it please your Excellency," thus replied
      Our British friend, "these are the wives of others,
    And not our own. I am too qualified
      By service with my military brothers
    To break the rules by bringing one's own bride
      Into a camp: I know that nought so bothers
    The hearts of the heroic on a charge,
    As leaving a small family at large.

                      LXXII.

    "But these are but two Turkish ladies, who
      With their attendant aided our escape,
    And afterwards accompanied us through
      A thousand perils in this dubious shape.
    To me this kind of life is not so new;
      To them, poor things, it is an awkward scrape:
    I therefore, if you wish me to fight freely,
    Request that they may both be used genteelly."

                      LXXIII.

    Meantime these two poor girls, with swimming eyes,
      Looked on as if in doubt if they could trust
    Their own protectors; nor was their surprise
      Less than their grief (and truly not less just)
    To see an old man, rather wild than wise
      In aspect, plainly clad, besmeared with dust,
    Stripped to his waistcoat, and that not too clean,
    More feared than all the Sultans ever seen.

                      LXXIV.

    For everything seemed resting on his nod,
      As they could read in all eyes. Now to them,
    Who were accustomed, as a sort of god,
      To see the Sultan, rich in many a gem,
    Like an imperial peacock stalk abroad
      (That royal bird, whose tail's a diadem,)
    With all the pomp of Power, it was a doubt
    How Power could condescend to do without.

                      LXXV.

    John Johnson, seeing their extreme dismay,
      Though little versed in feelings oriental,
    Suggested some slight comfort in his way:
      Don Juan, who was much more sentimental,
    Swore they should see him by the dawn of day,
      Or that the Russian army should repent all:
    And, strange to say, they found some consolation
    In this--for females like exaggeration.

                      LXXVI.

    And then with tears, and sighs, and some slight kisses,
      They parted for the present--these to await,
    According to the artillery's hits or misses,
      What sages call Chance, Providence, or Fate--
    (Uncertainty is one of many blisses,
      A mortgage on Humanity's estate;)[hv]
    While their belovéd friends began to arm,
    To burn a town which never did them harm.

                      LXXVII.

    Suwarrow,--who but saw things in the gross.
      Being much too gross to see them in detail,
    Who calculated life as so much dross,
      And as the wind a widowed nation's wail,
    And cared as little for his army's loss
      (So that their efforts should at length prevail)
    As wife and friends did for the boils of Job,--
    What was 't to him to hear two women sob?

                      LXXVIII.

    Nothing.--The work of Glory still went on
      In preparations for a cannonade
    As terrible as that of Ilion,
      If Homer had found mortars ready made;
    But now, instead of slaying Priam's son,
      We only can but talk of escalade,
    Bombs, drums, guns, bastions, batteries, bayonets, bullets--
    Hard words, which stick in the soft Muses' gullets.

                      LXXIX.

    Oh, thou eternal Homer! who couldst charm
      All ears, though long; all ages, though so short,
    By merely wielding with poetic arm
      Arms to which men will never more resort,
    Unless gunpowder should be found to harm
      Much less than is the hope of every court,
    Which now is leagued young Freedom to annoy;
    But they will not find Liberty a Troy:--

                      LXXX.

    Oh, thou eternal Homer! I have now
      To paint a siege, wherein more men were slain,
    With deadlier engines and a speedier blow,
      Than in thy Greek gazette of that campaign;
    And yet, like all men else, I must allow,
      To vie with thee would be about as vain
    As for a brook to cope with Ocean's flood,--
    But still we moderns equal you in blood:[hw]

                      LXXXI.

    If not in poetry, at least in fact;
      And fact is Truth, the grand desideratum!
    Of which, howe'er the Muse describes each act,
      There should be ne'ertheless a slight substratum.
    But now the town is going to be attacked;
      Great deeds are doing--how shall I relate 'em?
    Souls of immortal Generals! Phoebus watches
    To colour up his rays from your despatches.[hx]

                      LXXXII.

    Oh, ye great bulletins of Bonaparte!
      Oh, ye less grand long lists of killed and wounded!
    Shade of Leonidas, who fought so hearty,
      When my poor Greece was once, as now, surrounded!
    Oh, Cæsar's Commentaries! now impart, ye
      Shadows of Glory! (lest I be confounded),
    A portion of your fading twilight hues--
    So beautiful, so fleeting--to the Muse.

                      LXXXIII.

    When I call "fading" martial immortality,
      I mean, that every age and every year,
    And almost every day, in sad reality,
      Some sucking hero is compelled to rear,
    Who, when we come to sum up the totality
      Of deeds to human happiness most dear,
    Turns out to be a butcher in great business,
    Afflicting young folks with a sort of dizziness.

                      LXXXIV.

    Medals, rank, ribands, lace, embroidery, scarlet,
      Are things immortal to immortal man,
    As purple to the Babylonian harlot;[hy]
      An uniform to boys is like a fan
    To women; there is scarce a crimson varlet
      But deems himself the first in Glory's van.
    But Glory's glory; and if you would find
    What _that_ is--ask the pig who sees the wind!

                      LXXXV.

    At least _he feels it_, and some say he _sees_,
      Because he runs before it like a pig;
    Or, if that simple sentence should displease,
      Say, that he scuds before it like a brig,
    A schooner, or--but it is time to ease
      This Canto, ere my Muse perceives fatigue.
    The next shall ring a peal to shake all people,
    Like a bob-major from a village steeple.

                      LXXXVI.

    Hark! through the silence of the cold, dull night,
      The hum of armies gathering rank on rank!
    Lo! dusky masses steal in dubious sight
      Along the leaguered wall and bristling bank
    Of the armed river, while with straggling light
      The stars peep through the vapours dim and dank,
    Which curl in various wreaths:--how soon the smoke
    Of Hell shall pall them in a deeper cloak!

                      LXXXVII.

    Here pause we for the present--as even then
      That awful pause, dividing Life from Death,
    Struck for an instant on the hearts of men,--
      Thousands of whom were drawing their last breath!
    A moment--and all will be Life again!
      The march! the charge! the shouts of either faith,
    Hurrah! and Allah! and one moment more--
    The death-cry drowning in the Battle's roar.[hz][411]

Andrault, Comte de Langeron, born at Paris, January 13, 1763, on the
outbreak of the Revolution (1790) took service in the Russian Army. He
fought against the Swedes in 1790, and the Turks in 1791, and, after
serving as a volunteer in the army of the Duke of Brunswick (1792-93),
returned to Russia, and was raised to the rank of general in 1799. He
commanded a division of the Russian Army in the German campaign of 1813,
and entered Paris with Blücher, March 30, 1814. He was afterwards
Governor of Odessa and of New Russia; and, a second time, fought against
the Turks in 1828. He died at St. Petersburg, July 4, 1831. Joseph
Elizabeth Roger, Comte de Damas d'Antigny, born at Paris, September 4,
1765, owed his commission in the Russian Army to the influence of the
Prince de Ligne. He fought against the Turks in 1787-88, and was
distinguished for bravery and daring. At the Restoration in 1814 he
re-entered the French Army, was made Governor of Lyons; shared the
temporary exile of Louis XVIII. at Ghent in 1815, and, in the following
year, as commandant of a division, took part in repressing the
revolutionary disturbances in the central and southern departments of
France. He died at Cirey, September 3, 1823.--_La Grande Encyclopédie_.]

{314}[396] [Prince (Gregor Alexandrovitch) Potemkin, born 1736, died
October 15, 1791. "He alighted from his carriage in the midst of the
highway, threw himself on the grass, and died under a tree" (_Life of
Catherine II_., by W. Tooke, 1880, iii. 324). His character has been
drawn by Louis Philippe, Comte de Ségur, who, writes Tooke (_ibid_., p.
326), "lived a long time in habits of intimacy with him, and was so
obliging as to delineate it at our solicitation." "In his person were
collected the most opposite defects and advantages of every kind. He was
avaricious and ostentatious, ... haughty and obliging, politic and
confiding, licentious and superstitious, bold and timid, ambitious and
indiscreet; lavish of his bounties to his relations, his mistresses, and
his favourites, yet frequently paying neither his household nor his
creditors. His consequence always depended on a woman, and he was always
unfaithful to her. Nothing could equal the activity of his mind, nor the
indolence of his body. No dangers could appal his courage; no
difficulties force him to abandon his projects. But the success of an
enterprise always brought on disgust.... Everything with him was
desultory; business, pleasure, temper, carriage. His presence was a
restraint on every company. He was morose to all that stood in awe of
him, and caressed all such as accosted him with familiarity.... None had
read less than he; few people were better informed.... One while he
formed the project of becoming Duke of Courland; at another he thought
of bestowing on himself the crown of Poland. He frequently gave
intimations of an intention to make himself a bishop, or even a simple
monk. He built a superb palace, and wanted to sell it before it was
finished. In his youth he had pleased her [Catherine] by the ardour of
his passion, by his valour, and by his masculine beauty.... Become the
rival of Orloff, he performed for his sovereign whatever the most
romantic passion could inspire. He put out his eye, to free it from a
blemish which diminished his beauty. Banished by his rival, he ran to
meet death in battle, and returned with glory."]

{315}[397] ["Ce projet, remis à un autre jour, éprouva encore les plus
grandes difficultés; son courage les surmonta: il ne s'agíssait que de

batteries; on comptait, le 12 décembre, quatre-vingts pièces de canon

field of battle (_Hist, de la_ N.R., 1827, ii. pp, 205, 206) summarizes
the Journal of the Duc de Richelieu. The original passage runs as
follows:--

"L'arrivée du comte Souvorow produisit un grand effet parmi les
troupes.... La manière d'être plus que simple, puis-qu'il logeait sous
une canonnière, et qu'il n'avait pas même de chaises dans sa tente, son
affabilité, sa bonhomie lui conciliaient l'affection de tous les
individus de son armée. Cet homme singulier qui ressemble plus à un chef
de cosaques ou de Tartares, qu'au général d'une armée européenne, est
doué d'une intrépidité et d'une hardiesse peu communes.... La manière de
vivre, de s'habiller et de parler du comte Souvorow, est aussi
singulière que ses opinions militaires.... II mangeait dans sa tente
assis par terre autour d'une natte sur laquelle il prenait le plus
détestable repas. L'apres-midi, un semblable repas lui servait de
souper, il s'endormait ensuite pendant quelques heures, passait une
partie de la nuit à chanter, et a la pointe du jour il sortait presque
nu et se roulait sur l'herbe assurant que cet exercice lui était
necessaire pour le preserver des rhumatismes.... Sa manière de
s'exprimer dans toutes les langues est aussi singulière que toute sa
façon d'être, ses phrases sont incohérentes, et s'il n'est pas insensé,
il dit et fait du moins tout ce qu'il faut pour le paraître; mais il est
heureux et cette quality dont le Cardinal Mazarin faisait tant de cas,
est, à bon droit, fort estimée de l'Impératrice et du Prince Potemkin
... Le moment de l'arrivée du Comte Souvorow fut annonce par une
décharge générale des batteries ou camp et de la flotte."--_Journal de mon

[408] [For a detailed account of Suvóroff's personal characteristics,
see _The Life of Field-Marshal Souvaroff_, by L.M.P. Tranchant de
Laverne, 1814, pp. 267-291; and _Suvóroff_, by Lieut.-Colonel Spalding,
1890, pp. 222-229.

Byron's epithet "buffoon" (line 5) may, perhaps, be traced to the
following anecdote recorded by Tranchant de Laverne (p. 281): "During
the first war of Poland ... he published, in the order of the day, that
at the first crowing of the cock the troops would march to attack the
enemy, and caused the spy to send word that the Russians would be upon
them some time after midnight. But about eight o'clock Souvarof ran
through the camp, imitating the crowing of a cock.... The enemy,
completely surprised, lost a great number of men."

For his "praying" (line 6), _vide ibid._, pp. 272, 273: "He made a short
prayer after each meal, and again when going to bed. He usually
performed his devotions before an image of St. Nicholas, the patron
saint of Russia."

"Half-dirt" (line 5) is, however, a calumny (_ibid_. p. 272): "It was
his custom to rise at the earliest dawn; several buckets of cold water
were thrown over his naked body."

The same writer (p. 268) repudiates the charges of excessive barbarity
and cruelty brought against Suvóroff by C.F.P. Masson, in his _Mémoires
Secrets sur la Russie_ (_vide_, e.g., ed. 1800, i. 311): "Souvorow ne
scroit que le plus ridicule bouffon, s'il n'étoit pas montré le plus
barbare guerrier. C'est un monstre, qui renferme dans le corps d'un
singe l'âme d'un chien de boucher. Attila, son compatriote, et don't il
descend, peut-être ne fut ni si heureux, ni si féroce."

Suvóroff did not regard himself as "half-demon." "Your pencil," he
reminded the artist Müller, "will delineate the features of my face.
These are visible: but my inner man is hidden. I must tell you that I
have shed rivers of blood. I tremble, but I love my neighbour. In my
whole life I have made no one unhappy; not an insect hath perished by my
hand. I was little; I was big. In fortune's ebb and flow, relying on
God, I stood immovable--even as now." (_Suvóroff_, 1890, p. 228,
note.)]

                CANTO THE EIGHTH.

                      I.

    Oh, blood and thunder! and oh, blood and wounds!
      These are but vulgar oaths, as you may deem,
    Too gentle reader! and most shocking sounds:--
      And so they are; yet thus is Glory's dream
    Unriddled, and as my true Muse expounds
      At present such things, since they are her theme,
    So be they her inspirers! Call them Mars,
    Bellona, what you will--they mean but wars.

                      II.

    All was prepared--the fire, the sword, the men
      To wield them in their terrible array,--
    The army, like a lion from his den,
      Marched forth with nerve and sinews bent to slay,--
    A human Hydra, issuing from its fen
      To breathe destruction on its winding way,
    Whose heads were heroes, which cut off in vain
    Immediately in others grew again.

                      III.

    History can only take things in the gross;
      But could we know them in detail, perchance
    In balancing the profit and the loss,
      War's merit it by no means might enhance,
    To waste so much gold for a little dross,
      As hath been done, mere conquest to advance.
    The drying up a single tear has more
    Of honest fame, than shedding seas of gore.

                      IV.

    And why?--because it brings self-approbation;
      Whereas the other, after all its glare,
    Shouts, bridges, arches, pensions from a nation,
      Which (it may be) has not much left to spare,
    A higher title, or a loftier station,
      Though they may make Corruption gape or stare,
    Yet, in the end, except in Freedom's battles,
    Are nothing but a child of Murder's rattles.

                      V.

    And such they are--and such they will be found:
      Not so Leonidas and Washington,
    Whose every battle-field is holy ground,
      Which breathes of nations saved, not worlds undone.
    How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!
      While the mere victor's may appal or stun
    The servile and the vain--such names will be
    A watchword till the Future shall be free.

                      VI.

    The night was dark, and the thick mist allowed
      Nought to be seen save the artillery's flame,
    Which arched the horizon like a fiery cloud,
      And in the Danube's waters shone the same--[412]
    A mirrored Hell! the volleying roar, and loud
      Long booming of each peal on peal, o'ercame
    The ear far more than thunder; for Heaven's flashes
    Spare, or smite rarely--Man's make millions ashes!

                      VII.

    The column ordered on the assault scarce passed
      Beyond the Russian batteries a few toises,
    When up the bristling Moslem rose at last,
      Answering the Christian thunders with like voices:
    Then one vast fire, air, earth, and stream embraced,
      Which rocked as 't were beneath the mighty noises;
    While the whole rampart blazed like Etna, when
    The restless Titan hiccups in his den;[413]

                      VIII.

    And one enormous shout of "Allah!"[414] rose
      In the same moment, loud as even the roar
    Of War's most mortal engines, to their foes
      Hurling defiance: city, stream, and shore
    Resounded "Allah!" and the clouds which close
      With thickening canopy the conflict o'er,
    Vibrate to the Eternal name. Hark! through
    All sounds it pierceth--"Allah! Allah Hu!"[415]

                      IX.

    The columns were in movement one and all,
      But of the portion which attacked by water,
    Thicker than leaves the lives began to fall,[416]
      Though led by Arseniew, that great son of slaughter,
    As brave as ever faced both bomb and ball.
      "Carnage" (so Wordsworth tells you) "is God's daughter:"[417]
    If _he_ speak truth, she is Christ's sister, and
    Just now behaved as in the Holy Land.

                      X.

    The Prince de Ligne was wounded in the knee;
      Count Chapeau-Bras,[ia]--too, had a ball between
    His cap and head,[418] which proves the head to be
      Aristocratic as was ever seen,
    Because it then received no injury
      More than the cap; in fact, the ball could mean
    No harm unto a right legitimate head;
    "Ashes to ashes"--why not lead to lead?

                      XI.

    Also the General Markow, Brigadier,
      Insisting on removal of _the Prince_
    Amidst some groaning thousands dying near,--
      All common fellows, who might writhe and wince,
    And shriek for water into a deaf ear,--
      The General Markow, who could thus evince
    His sympathy for rank, by the same token,
    To teach him greater, had his own leg broken.[419]

                      XII.

    Three hundred cannon threw up their emetic,
      And thirty thousand muskets flung their pills
    Like hail, to make a bloody Diuretic.[420]
      Mortality! thou hast thy monthly bills:
    Thy plagues--thy famines--thy physicians--yet tick,
      Like the death-watch, within our ears the ills
    Past, present, and to come;--but all may yield
    To the true portrait of one battle-field;

                      XIII.

    There the still varying pangs, which multiply
      Until their very number makes men hard
    By the infinities of agony,
      Which meet the gaze, whate'er it may regard--
    The groan, the roll in dust, the all-_white_ eye
      Turned back within its socket,--these reward
    Your rank and file by thousands, while the rest
    May win perhaps a riband at the breast!

                      XIV.

    Yet I love Glory;--Glory's a great thing:--
      Think what it is to be in your old age
    Maintained at the expense of your good King:
      A moderate pension shakes full many a sage,
    And Heroes are but made for bards to sing,
      Which is still better--thus, in verse, to wage
    Your wars eternally, besides enjoying
    Half-pay for life, make Mankind worth destroying.

                      XV.

    The troops, already disembarked, pushed on
      To take a battery on the right: the others,
    Who landed lower down, their landing done,
      Had set to work as briskly as their brothers:
    Being grenadiers, they mounted one by one,
      Cheerful as children climb the breasts of mothers,
    O'er the intrenchment and the palisade,[421]
    Quite orderly, as if upon parade.

                      XVI.

    And this was admirable: for so hot
      The fire was, that were red Vesuvius loaded,
    Besides its lava, with all sorts of shot
      And shells or hells, it could not more have goaded.
    Of officers a third fell on the spot,
      A thing which Victory by no means boded
    To gentlemen engaged in the assault:
    Hounds, when the huntsman tumbles, are at fault.

                      XVII.

    But here I leave the general concern
      To track our Hero on his path of Fame:
    He must his laurels separately earn--
      For fifty thousand heroes, name by name,
    Though all deserving equally to turn
      A couplet, or an elegy to claim,
    Would form a lengthy lexicon of Glory,
    And, what is worse still, a much longer story:

                      XVIII.

    And therefore we must give the greater number
      To the Gazette--which doubtless fairly dealt
    By the deceased, who lie in famous slumber
      In ditches, fields, or wheresoe'er they felt
    Their clay for the last time their souls encumber;--
      Thrice happy he whose name has been well spelt
    In the despatch: I knew a man whose loss
    Was printed _Grove_, although his name was Grose.[422]

                      XIX.

    Juan and Johnson joined a certain corps,
      And fought away with might and main, not knowing
    The way which they had never trod before,
      And still less guessing where they might be going;
    But on they marched, dead bodies trampling o'er,
      Firing, and thrusting, slashing, sweating, glowing,
    But fighting thoughtlessly enough to win,
    To their _two_ selves, _one_ whole bright bulletin.

                      XX.

    Thus on they wallowed in the bloody mire
      Of dead and dying thousands,--sometimes gaining
    A yard or two of ground, which brought them nigher
      To some odd angle for which all were straining;
    At other times, repulsed by the close fire,
      Which really poured as if all Hell were raining
    Instead of Heaven, they stumbled backwards o'er
    A wounded comrade, sprawling in his gore.

                      XXI.

    Though 't was Don Juan's first of fields, and though
      The nightly muster and the silent march
    In the chill dark, when Courage does not glow
      So much as under a triumphal arch,
    Perhaps might make him shiver, yawn, or throw
      A glance on the dull clouds (as thick as starch,
    Which stiffened Heaven) as if he wished for day;--
    Yet for all this he did not run away.

                      XXII.

    Indeed he could not. But what if he had?
      There _have been_ and _are_ heroes who begun
    With something not much better, or as bad:
      Frederick the Great from Molwitz[423] deigned to run,
    For the first and last time; for, like a pad,
      Or hawk, or bride, most mortals after one
    Warm bout are broken in to their new tricks,
    And fight like fiends for pay or politics.

                      XXIII.

    He was what Erin calls, in her sublime
      Old Erse or Irish, or it may be _Punic_;--
    (The antiquarians[424]--who can settle Time,
      Which settles all things, Roman, Greek, or Runic--
    Swear that Pat's language sprung from the same clime
      With Hannibal, and wears the Tyrian tunic
    Of Dido's alphabet--and this is rational
    As any other notion, and not national;)--

                      XXIV.

    But Juan was quite "a broth of a boy,"
      A thing of impulse and a child of song;
    Now swimming in the sentiment of joy,
      Or the _sensation_ (if that phrase seem wrong),
    And afterward, if he must needs destroy,
      In such good company as always throng
    To battles, sieges, and that kind of pleasure,
    No less delighted to employ his leisure;

                      XXV.

    But always without malice: if he warred
      Or loved, it was with what we call "the best
    Intentions," which form all Mankind's _trump card_,
      To be produced when brought up to the test.
    The statesman--hero--harlot--lawyer--ward
      Off each attack, when people are in quest
    Of their designs, by saying they _meant well_;
    'T is pity "that such meaning should pave Hell."[425]

                      XXVI.

    I almost lately have begun to doubt
      Whether Hell's pavement--if it be so _paved_--
    Must not have latterly been quite worn out,
      Not by the numbers good intent hath saved,
    But by the mass who go below without
      Those ancient good intentions, which once shaved
    And smoothed the brimstone of that street of Hell
    Which bears the greatest likeness to Pall Mall.[ib]

                      XXVII.

    Juan, by some strange chance, which oft divides
      Warrior from warrior in their grim career,
    Like chastest wives from constant husbands' sides
      Just at the close of the first bridal year,
    By one of those odd turns of Fortune's tides,
      Was on a sudden rather puzzled here,
    When, after a good deal of heavy firing,
    He found himself alone, and friends retiring.

                      XXVIII.

    I don't know how the thing occurred--it might
      Be that the greater part were killed or wounded,
    And that the rest had faced unto the right
      About; a circumstance which has confounded
    Cæsar himself, who, in the very sight
      Of his whole army, which so much abounded
    In courage, was obliged to snatch a shield,
    And rally back his Romans to the field.[426]

                      XXIX.

    Juan, who had no shield to snatch, and was
      No Cæsar, but a fine young lad, who fought
    He knew not why, arriving at this pass,
      Stopped for a minute, as perhaps he ought
    For a much longer time; then, like an ass
      (Start not, kind reader, since great Homer[427] thought
    This simile enough for Ajax, Juan
    Perhaps may find it better than a new one);

                      XXX.

    Then, like an ass, he went upon his way,
      And, what was stranger, never looked behind;
    But seeing, flashing forward, like the day
      Over the hills, a fire enough to blind
    Those who dislike to look upon a fray,
      He stumbled on, to try if he could find
    A path, to add his own slight arm and forces
    To corps, the greater part of which were corses.

                      XXXI.

    Perceiving then no more the commandant
      Of his own corps, nor even the corps, which had
    Quite disappeared--the gods know how! (I can't
      Account for everything which may look bad
    In history; but we at least may grant
      It was not marvellous that a mere lad,
    In search of Glory, should look on before,
    Nor care a pinch of snuff about his corps:)--[ic]

                      XXXII.

    Perceiving nor commander nor commanded,
      And left at large, like a young heir, to make
    His way to--where he knew not--single handed;
      As travellers follow over bog and brake
    An "ignis fatuus;" or as sailors stranded
      Unto the nearest hut themselves betake;
    So Juan, following Honour and his nose,
    Rushed where the thickest fire announced most foes.[428]

                      XXXIII.

    He knew not where he was, nor greatly cared,
      For he was dizzy, busy, and his veins
    Filled as with lightning--for his spirit shared
      The hour, as is the case with lively brains;
    And where the hottest fire was seen and heard,
      And the loud cannon pealed his hoarsest strains,
    He rushed, while earth and air were sadly shaken
    By thy humane discovery, Friar Bacon![id][429]

                      XXXIV.

    And as he rushed along, it came to pass he
      Fell in with what was late the second column,
    Under the orders of the General Lascy,
      But now reduced, as is a bulky volume
    Into an elegant extract (much less massy)
      Of heroism, and took his place with solemn
    Air 'midst the rest, who kept their valiant faces
    And levelled weapons still against the Glacis.[ie]

                      XXXV.

    Just at this crisis up came Johnson too,
      Who had "retreated," as the phrase is when
    Men run away much rather than go through
      Destruction's jaws into the Devil's den;
    But Johnson was a clever fellow, who
      Knew when and how "to cut and come again,"
    And never ran away, except when running
    Was nothing but a valorous kind of cunning.

                      XXXVI.

    And so, when all his corps were dead or dying,
      Except Don Juan, a mere novice, whose
    More virgin valour never dreamt of flying,
      From ignorance of danger, which indues
    Its votaries, like Innocence relying
      On its own strength, with careless nerves and thews,--
    Johnson retired a little, just to rally
    Those who catch cold in "shadows of Death's valley."

                      XXXVII.

    And there, a little sheltered from the shot,
      Which rained from bastion, battery, parapet,
    Rampart, wall, casement, house--for there was not
      In this extensive city, sore beset
    By Christian soldiery, a single spot
      Which did not combat like the Devil, as yet,--
    He found a number of Chasseurs, all scattered
    By the resistance of the chase they battered.

                      XXXVIII.

    And these he called on; and, what 's strange, they came
      Unto his call, unlike "the spirits from
    The vasty deep," to whom you may exclaim,
      Says Hotspur, long ere they will leave their home:--[430]
    Their reasons were uncertainty, or shame
      At shrinking from a bullet or a bomb,
    And that odd impulse, which in wars or creeds[if]
    Makes men, like cattle, follow him who leads.

                      XXXIX.

    By Jove! he was a noble fellow, Johnson,
      And though his name, than Ajax or Achilles,
    Sounds less harmonious, underneath the sun soon
      We shall not see his likeness: he could kill his
    Man quite as quietly as blows the Monsoon
      Her steady breath (which some months the same _still_ is):
    Seldom he varied feature, hue, or muscle,
    And could be very busy without bustle;

                      XL.

    And therefore, when he ran away, he did so
      Upon reflection, knowing that behind
    He would find others who would fain be rid so
      Of idle apprehensions, which like wind
    Trouble heroic stomachs. Though their lids so
      Oft are soon closed, all heroes are not blind,
    But when they light upon immediate death,
    Retire a little, merely to take breath.

                      XLI.

    But Johnson only ran off, to return
      With many other warriors, as we said,
    Unto that rather somewhat misty bourne,
      Which Hamlet tells us is a pass of dread.[431]
    To Jack, howe'er, this gave but slight concern:
      His soul (like galvanism upon the dead)
    Acted upon the living as on wire,
    And led them back into the heaviest fire.

                      XLII.

    Egad! they found the second time what they
      The first time thought quite terrible enough
    To fly from, malgré all which people say
      Of Glory, and all that immortal stuff
    Which fills a regiment (besides their pay,
      That daily shilling which makes warriors tough)--
    They found on their return the self-same welcome,
    Which made some _think_, and others _know_, a _hell_ come.

                      XLIII.

    They fell as thick as harvests beneath hail,
      Grass before scythes, or corn below the sickle,
    Proving that trite old truth, that Life's as frail
      As any other boon for which men stickle.
    The Turkish batteries thrashed them like a flail,
      Or a good boxer, into a sad pickle
    Putting the very bravest, who were knocked
    Upon the head before their guns were cocked.

                      XLIV.

    The Turks behind the traverses and flanks
      Of the next bastion, fired away like devils,
    And swept, as gales sweep foam away, whole ranks:
      However, Heaven knows how, the Fate who levels
    Towns--nations--worlds, in her revolving pranks,
      So ordered it, amidst these sulphury revels,
    That Johnson, and some few who had not scampered,
    Reached the interior "talus"[432] of the rampart.[433]

                      XLV.

    First one or two, then five, six, and a dozen
      Came mounting quickly up, for it was now
    All neck or nothing, as, like pitch or rosin,
      Flame was showered forth above, as well 's below,
    So that you scarce could say who best had chosen,
      The gentlemen that were the first to show
    Their martial faces on the parapet,
    Or those who thought it brave to wait as yet.

                      XLVI.

    But those who scaled, found out that their advance
      Was favoured by an accident or blunder:
    The Greek or Turkish Cohorn's[434] ignorance
      Had pallisadoed in a way you'd wonder
    To see in forts of Netherlands or France--
      (Though these to our Gibraltar must knock under)--
    Right in the middle of the parapet
    Just named, these palisades were primly set:[435]

                      XLVII.

    So that on either side some nine or ten
      Paces were left, whereon you could contrive
    To march; a great convenience to our men,
      At least to all those who were left alive,
    Who thus could form a line and fight again;
      And that which farther aided them to strive
    Was, that they could kick down the palisades,
    Which scarcely rose much higher than grass blades.[436]

                      XLVIII.

    Among the first,--I will not say _the first_,
      For such precedence upon such occasions
    Will oftentimes make deadly quarrels burst
      Out between friends as well as allied nations:
    The Briton must be bold who really durst
      Put to such trial John Bull's partial patience,
    As say that Wellington at Waterloo
    Was beaten,--though the Prussians say so too;--

                      XLIX.

    And that if Blucher, Bulow, Gneisenau,
      And God knows who besides in "au" and "ow,"
    Had not come up in time to cast an awe[437]
      Into the hearts of those who fought till now
    As tigers combat with an empty craw,
      The Duke of Wellington had ceased to show
    His Orders--also to receive his pensions,
    Which are the heaviest that our history mentions.

                      L.

    But never mind;--"God save the King!" and _Kings!_
      For if _he_ don't, I doubt if _men_ will longer--
    I think I hear a little bird, who sings
      The people by and by will be the stronger:
    The veriest jade will wince whose harness wrings
      So much into the raw as quite to wrong her
    Beyond the rules of posting,--and the mob
    At last fall sick of imitating Job.

                      LI.

    At first it grumbles, then it swears, and then,
      Like David, flings smooth pebbles 'gainst a Giant;
    At last it takes to weapons such as men
      Snatch when Despair makes human hearts less pliant.
    Then comes "the tug of war;"--'t will come again,
      I rather doubt; and I would fain say "fie on 't,"
    If I had not perceived that Revolution
    Alone can save the earth from Hell's pollution.

                      LII.

    But to continue:--I say not _the_ first,
      But of the first, our little friend Don Juan
    Walked o'er the walls of Ismail, as if nursed
      Amidst such scenes--though this was quite a new one
    To him, and I should hope to _most_. The thirst
      Of Glory, which so pierces through and through one,
    Pervaded him--although a generous creature,
    As warm in heart as feminine in feature.[ig]

                      LIII.

    And here he was--who upon Woman's breast,
      Even from a child, felt like a child; howe'er
    The Man in all the rest might be confessed,
      To him it was Elysium to be there;
    And he could even withstand that awkward test
      Which Rousseau points out to the dubious fair,
    "Observe your lover when he _leaves_ your arms;"
    But Juan never _left_ them--while they had charms,

                      LIV.

    Unless compelled by Fate, or wave, or wind,
      Or near relations--who are much the same.
    But _here_ he was!--where each tie that can bind
      Humanity must yield to steel and flame:
    And _he_ whose very body was all mind,
      Flung here by Fate or Circumstance, which tame
    The loftiest, hurried by the time and place,
    Dashed on like a spurred blood-horse in a race.

                      LV.

    So was his blood stirred while he found resistance,
      As is the hunter's at the five-bar gate,
    Or double post and rail, where the existence
      Of Britain's youth depends upon their weight--The
    lightest being the safest: at a distance
      He hated cruelty, as all men hate
    Blood, until heated--and even then his own
    At times would curdle o'er some heavy groan.

                      LVI.

    The General Lascy, who had been hard pressed,
      Seeing arrive an aid so opportune
    As were some hundred youngsters all abreast,
      Who came as if just dropped down from the moon
    To Juan, who was nearest him, addressed
      His thanks, and hopes to take the city soon,
    Not reckoning him to be a "base Bezonian"[438]
    (As Pistol calls it), but a young Livonian.[439]

                      LVII.

    Juan, to whom he spoke in German, knew
      As much of German as of Sanscrit, and
    In answer made an inclination to
      The General who held him in command;
    For seeing one with ribands, black and blue,
      Stars, medals, and a bloody sword in hand,
    Addressing him in tones which seemed to thank,
    He recognised an officer of rank.

                      LVIII.

    Short speeches pass between two men who speak
      No common language; and besides, in time
    Of war and taking towns, when many a shriek
      Rings o'er the dialogue, and many a crime
    Is perpetrated ere a word can break
      Upon the ear, and sounds of horror chime
    In like church-bells, with sigh, howl, groan, yell, prayer,
    There cannot be much conversation there.

                      LIX.

    And therefore all we have related in
      Two long octaves, passed in a little minute;
    But in the same small minute, every sin
      Contrived to get itself comprised within it.
    The very cannon, deafened by the din,
      Grew dumb, for you might almost hear a linnet,
    As soon as thunder, 'midst the general noise
    Of Human Nature's agonizing voice!

                      LX.

    The town was entered. Oh Eternity!--
      "God made the country, and man made the town,"
    So Cowper says[440]--and I begin to be
      Of his opinion, when I see cast down
    Rome--Babylon-Tyre-Carthage--Nineveh--
      All walls men know, and many never known;
    And pondering on the present and the past,
    To deem the woods shall be our home at last:--

                      LXI.

    Of all men, saving Sylla,[441] the man-slayer,
      Who passes for in life and death most lucky,
    Of the great names which in our faces stare,
      The General Boon, back-woodsman of Kentucky,[442]
    Was happiest amongst mortals anywhere;
      For killing nothing but a bear or buck, he
    Enjoyed the lonely, vigorous, harmless days
    Of his old age in wilds of deepest maze.

                      LXII.

    Crime came not near him--she is not the child
      Of solitude; Health shrank not from him--for
    Her home is in the rarely trodden wild,
      Where if men seek her not, and death be more
    Their choice than life, forgive them, as beguiled
      By habit to what their own hearts abhor--
    In cities caged. The present case in point I
    Cite is, that Boon lived hunting up to ninety;

                      LXIII.

    And, what's still stranger, left behind a name
      For which men vainly decimate the throng,
    Not only famous, but of that _good_ fame,
      Without which Glory's but a tavern song--
    Simple, serene, the _antipodes_ of Shame,
      Which Hate nor Envy e'er could tinge with wrong;
    An active hermit, even in age the child
    Of Nature--or the Man of Ross[443] run wild.

                      LXIV.

    'T is true he shrank from men even of his nation,
      When they built up unto his darling trees,--
    He moved some hundred miles off, for a station
      Where there were fewer houses and more ease;
    The inconvenience of civilisation
      Is, that you neither can be pleased nor please;
    But where he met the individual man,
    He showed himself as kind as mortal can.

                      LXV.

    He was not all alone: around him grew
      A sylvan tribe of children of the chase,
    Whose young, unwakened world was ever new,
      Nor sword nor sorrow yet had left a trace
    On her unwrinkled brow, nor could you view
      A frown on Nature's or on human face;
    The free-born forest found and kept them free,
    And fresh as is a torrent or a tree.

                      LXVI.

    And tall, and strong, and swift of foot were they,
      Beyond the dwarfing city's pale abortions,
    Because their thoughts had never been the prey
      Of care or gain: the green woods were their portions;
    No sinking spirits told them they grew grey,
      No fashion made them apes of her distortions;
    Simple they were, not savage--and their rifles,
    Though very true, were not yet used for trifles.

                      LXVII.

    Motion was in their days, Rest in their slumbers,
      And Cheerfulness the handmaid of their toil;
    Nor yet too many nor too few their numbers;
      Corruption could not make their hearts her soil;
    The lust which stings, the splendour which encumbers,
      With the free foresters divide no spoil;
    Serene, not sullen, were the solitudes
    Of this unsighing people of the woods.

                      LXVIII.

    So much for Nature:--by way of variety,
      Now back to thy great joys, Civilisation!
    And the sweet consequence of large society,
      War--pestilence--the despot's desolation,
    The kingly scourge, the lust of notoriety,
      The millions slain by soldiers for their ration,
    The scenes like Catherine's boudoir at threescore,[444]
    With Ismail's storm to soften it the more.

                      LXIX.

    The town was entered: first one column made
      Its sanguinary way good--then another;
    The reeking bayonet and the flashing blade
      Clashed 'gainst the scimitar, and babe and mother
    With distant shrieks were heard Heaven to upbraid:--
      Still closer sulphury clouds began to smother
    The breath of morn and man, where foot by foot
    The maddened Turks their city still dispute.

                      LXX.

    Koutousow,[445] he who afterwards beat back
      (With some assistance from the frost and snow)
    Napoleon on his bold and bloody track,
      It happened was himself beat back just now:
    He was a jolly fellow, and could crack
      His jest alike in face of friend or foe,
    Though Life, and Death, and Victory were at stake;[446]
    But here it seemed his jokes had ceased to take:

                      LXXI.

    For having thrown himself into a ditch,
      Followed in haste by various grenadiers,
    Whose blood the puddle greatly did enrich,
      He climbed to where the parapet appears;
    But there his project reached its utmost pitch
      ('Mongst other deaths the General Ribaupierre's
    Was much regretted), for the Moslem men
    Threw them all down into the ditch again.[447]

                      LXXII.

    And had it not been for some stray troops landing
      They knew not where, being carried by the stream
    To some spot, where they lost their understanding,
      And wandered up and down as in a dream,
    Until they reached, as daybreak was expanding,
      That which a portal to their eyes did seem,--
    The great and gay Koutousow might have lain
    Where three parts of his column yet remain.[448]

                      LXXIII.

    And scrambling round the rampart, these same troops,
      After the taking of the "Cavalier,"[449]
    Just as Koutousow's most "forlorn" of "hopes"
      Took, like chameleons, some slight tinge of fear,
    Opened the gate called "Kilia," to the groups[450]
      Of baffled heroes, who stood shyly near,
    Sliding knee-deep in lately frozen mud,
    Now thawed into a marsh of human blood.

                      LXXIV.

    The Kozacks, or, if so you please, Cossacques--
      (I don't much pique myself upon orthography,
    So that I do not grossly err in facts,
      Statistics, tactics, politics, and geography)--
    Having been used to serve on horses' backs,
      And no great dilettanti in topography
    Of fortresses, but fighting where it pleases
    Their chiefs to order,--were all cut to pieces.[451]

                      LXXV.

    Their column, though the Turkish batteries thundered
      Upon them, ne'ertheless had reached the rampart,[452]
    And naturally thought they could have plundered
      The city, without being farther hampered;
    But as it happens to brave men, they blundered--
      The Turks at first pretended to have scampered,
    Only to draw them 'twixt two bastion corners,[453]
    From whence they sallied on those Christian scorners.

                      LXXVI.

    Then being taken by the tail--a taking
      Fatal to bishops as to soldiers--these[ih]
    Cossacques were all cut off as day was breaking,
      And found their lives were let at a short lease--But
    perished without shivering or shaking,
      Leaving as ladders their heaped carcasses,
    O'er which Lieutenant-Colonel Yesouskoi
    Marched with the brave battalion of Polouzki:--[454]

                      LXXVII.

    This valiant man killed all the Turks he met,
      But could not eat them, being in his turn
    Slain by some Mussulmans,[455] who would not yet,
      Without resistance, see their city burn.
    The walls were won, but 't was an even bet
      Which of the armies would have cause to mourn:
    'T was blow for blow, disputing inch by inch,
    For one would not retreat, nor 't other flinch.

                      LXXVIII.

    Another column also suffered much:--
      And here we may remark with the historian,
    You should but give few cartridges to such
      Troops as are meant to march with greatest glory on:
    When matters must be carried by the touch
      Of the bright bayonet, and they all should hurry on;
    They sometimes, with a hankering for existence,
    Keep merely firing at a foolish distance.[456]

                      LXXIX.

    A junction of the General Meknop's men
      (Without the General, who had fallen some time
    Before, being badly seconded just then)
      Was made at length with those who dared to climb
    The death-disgorging rampart once again;
      And, though the Turk's resistance was sublime,
    They took the bastion, which the Seraskier
    Defended at a price extremely dear.[457]

                      LXXX.

    Juan and Johnson, and some volunteers,
      Among the foremost, offered him good quarter,
    A word which little suits with Seraskiers,
      Or at least suited not this valiant Tartar.
    He died, deserving well his country's tears,
      A savage sort of military martyr:
    An English naval officer, who wished
    To make him prisoner, was also dished:

                      LXXXI.

    For all the answer to his proposition
      Was from a pistol-shot that laid him dead;[458]
    On which the rest, without more intermission,
      Began to lay about with steel and lead--
    The pious metals most in requisition
      On such occasions: not a single head
    Was spared;--three thousand Moslems perished here,
    And sixteen bayonets pierced the Seraskier.[459]

                      LXXXII.

    The city's taken--only part by part--
      And Death is drunk with gore: there's not a street
    Where fights not to the last some desperate heart
      For those for whom it soon shall cease to beat.[460]
    Here War forgot his own destructive art
      In more destroying Nature; and the heat
    Of Carnage, like the Nile's sun-sodden slime,
    Engendered monstrous shapes of every crime.

                      LXXXIII.

    A Russian officer, in martial tread
      Over a heap of bodies, felt his heel
    Seized fast, as if 't were by the serpent's head
      Whose fangs Eve taught her human seed to feel;
    In vain he kicked, and swore, and writhed, and bled,
      And howled for help as wolves do for a meal--
    The teeth still kept their gratifying hold,
    As do the subtle snakes described of old.[ii]

                      LXXXIV.

    A dying Moslem, who had felt the foot
      Of a foe o'er him, snatched at it, and bit
    The very tendon which is most acute--
      (That which some ancient Muse or modern wit
    Named after thee, Achilles!) and quite through 't
      He made the teeth meet, nor relinquished it
    Even with his life--for (but they lie) 't is said
    To the live leg still clung the severed head.

                      LXXXV.

    However this may be, 't is pretty sure
      The Russian officer for life was lamed,
    For the Turk's teeth stuck faster than a skewer,
      And left him 'midst the invalid and maimed:
    The regimental surgeon could not cure
      His patient, and, perhaps, was to be blamed
    More than the head of the inveterate foe,
    Which was cut off, and scarce even then let go.

                      LXXXVI.

    But then the fact's a fact--and 't is the part
      Of a true poet to escape from fiction
    Whene'er he can; for there is little art
      in leaving verse more free from the restriction
    Of Truth than prose, unless to suit the mart
      For what is sometimes called poetic diction,
    And that outrageous appetite for lies
    Which Satan angles with for souls, like flies.[ij]

                      LXXXVII.

    The city's taken, but not rendered!--No!
      There's not a Moslem that hath yielded sword:
    The blood may gush out, as the Danube's flow
      Rolls by the city wall; but deed nor word
    Acknowledge aught of dread of Death or foe:
      In vain the yell of victory is roared
    By the advancing Muscovite--the groan
    Of the last foe is echoed by his own.

                      LXXXVIII.

    The bayonet pierces and the sabre cleaves,
      And human lives are lavished everywhere,
    As the year closing whirls the scarlet leaves[ik]
      When the stripped forest bows to the bleak air,
    And groans; and thus the peopled city grieves,
      Shorn of its best and loveliest, and left bare;
    But still it falls in vast and awful splinters,
    As oaks blown down with all their thousand winters.

                      LXXXIX.

    It is an awful topic--but 't is not
      My cue for any time to be terrific:
    For checkered as is seen our human lot
      With good, and bad, and worse, alike prolific
    Of melancholy merriment, to quote
      Too much of one sort would be soporific;--
    Without, or with, offence to friends or foes,
    I sketch your world exactly as it goes.

                      XC.

    And one good action in the midst of crimes
      Is "quite refreshing," in the affected phrase[461]
    Of these ambrosial, Pharisaic times,
      With all their pretty milk-and-water ways,
    And may serve therefore to bedew these rhymes,
      A little scorched at present with the blaze
    Of conquest and its consequences, which
    Make Epic poesy so rare and rich.

                      XCI.

    Upon a taken bastion, where there lay
      Thousands of slaughtered men, a yet warm group
    Of murdered women, who had found their way
      To this vain refuge, made the good heart droop
    And shudder;--while, as beautiful as May,
      A female child of ten years tried to stoop
    And hide her little palpitating breast
    Amidst the bodies lulled in bloody rest.[462]

                      XCII.

    Two villanous Cossacques pursued the child
      With flashing eyes and weapons: matched with _them_,
    The rudest brute that roams Siberia's wild
      Has feelings pure and polished as a gem,--
    The bear is civilised, the wolf is mild;
      And whom for this at last must we condemn?
    Their natures? or their sovereigns, who employ
    All arts to teach their subjects to destroy?

                      XCIII.

    Their sabres glittered o'er her little head,
      Whence her fair hair rose twining with affright,
    Her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead:
      When Juan caught a glimpse of this sad sight,
    I shall not say exactly what he _said_,
      Because it might not solace "ears polite;"[463]
    But what he _did_, was to lay on their backs,
    The readiest way of reasoning with Cossacques.

                      XCIV.

    One's hip he slashed, and split the other's shoulder,
      And drove them with their brutal yells to seek
    If there might be chirurgeons who could solder
      The wounds they richly merited,[464] and shriek
    Their baffled rage and pain; while waxing colder
      As he turned o'er each pale and gory cheek,
    Don Juan raised his little captive from
    The heap a moment more had made her tomb.

                      XCV.

    And she was chill as they, and on her face
      A slender streak of blood announced how near
    Her fate had been to that of all her race;
      For the same blow which laid her mother here
    Had scarred her brow, and left its crimson trace,
      As the last link with all she had held dear;[465]
    But else unhurt, she opened her large eyes,
    And gazed on Juan with a wild surprise.

                      XCVI.

    Just at this instant, while their eyes were fixed
      Upon each other, with dilated glance,
    In Juan's look, pain, pleasure, hope, fear, mixed
      With joy to save, and dread of some mischance
    Unto his protégée; while hers, transfixed
      With infant terrors, glared as from a trance,
    A pure, transparent, pale, yet radiant face,
    Like to a lighted alabaster vase:--[466]

                      XCVII.

    Up came John Johnson (I will not say _"Jack,"_
      For that were vulgar, cold, and common-place
    On great occasions, such as an attack
      On cities, as hath been the present case):
    Up Johnson came, with hundreds at his back,
      Exclaiming--"Juan! Juan! On, boy! brace
    Your arm, and I'll bet Moscow to a dollar,
    That you and I will win St. George's collar.[467]

                      XCVIII.

    "The Seraskier is knocked upon the head,
      But the stone bastion still remains, wherein
    The old Pacha sits among some hundreds dead,
      Smoking his pipe quite calmly 'midst the din
    Of our artillery and his own: 't is said
      Our killed, already piled up to the chin,
    Lie round the battery; but still it batters,
    And grape in volleys, like a vineyard, scatters.

                      XCIX.

    "Then up with me!"--But Juan answered, "Look
      Upon this child--I saved her--must not leave
    Her life to chance; but point me out some nook
      Of safety, where she less may shrink and grieve,
    And I am with you."--Whereon Johnson took
      A glance around--and shrugged--and twitched his sleeve
    And black silk neckcloth--and replied, "You're right;
    Poor thing! what's to be done? I'm puzzled quite."

                      C.

    Said Juan--"Whatsoever is to be
      Done, I'll not quit her till she seems secure
    Of present life a good deal more than we."--
      Quoth Johnson--"_Neither_ will I quite insure;
    But at the least _you_ may die gloriously."--
      Juan replied--" At least I will endure
    Whate'er is to be borne--but not resign
    This child, who is parentless, and therefore mine."

                      CI.

    Johnson said--"Juan, we've no time to lose;
      The child's a pretty child--a very pretty--
    I never saw such eyes--but hark! now choose
      Between your fame and feelings, pride and pity:--
    Hark! how the roar increases!--no excuse
      Will serve when there is plunder in a city;--
    I should be loath to march without you, but,
    By God! we'll be too late for the first cut."

                      CII.

    But Juan was immovable; until
      Johnson, who really loved him in his way,
    Picked out amongst his followers with some skill
      Such as he thought the least given up to prey,
    And, swearing, if the infant came to ill
      That they should all be shot on the next day,--
    But if she were delivered safe and sound,
    They should at least have fifty rubles round,

                      CIII.

    And all allowances besides of plunder
      In fair proportion with their comrades;--then
    Juan consented to march on through thunder,
      Which thinned at every step their ranks of men:
    And yet the rest rushed eagerly--no wonder,
      For they were heated by the hope of gain,
    A thing which happens everywhere each day--
    No hero trusteth wholly to half pay.

                      CIV.

    And such is Victory, and such is Man!
      At least nine tenths of what we call so:--God
    May have another name for half we scan
      As human beings, or his ways are odd.
    But to our subject: a brave Tartar Khan--
      Or "Sultan," as the author (to whose nod
    In prose I bend my humble verse) doth call
    This chieftain--somehow would not yield at all:

                      CV.

    But flanked by _five_ brave sons (such is polygamy,
      That she spawns warriors by the score, where none
    Are prosecuted for that false crime bigamy),
      He never would believe the city won
    While Courage clung but to a single twig.--Am I
      Describing Priam's, Peleus', or Jove's son?
    Neither--but a good, plain, old, temperate man,
    Who fought with his five children in the van.[468]

                      CVI.

    To _take_ him was the point.--The truly brave,
      When they behold the brave oppressed with odds,
    Are touched with a desire to shield and save;--
      A mixture of wild beasts and demi-gods
    Are they--now furious as the sweeping wave,
      Now moved with pity: even as sometimes nods
    The rugged tree unto the summer wind,
    Compassion breathes along the savage mind.

                      CVII.

    But he would _not_ be _taken_, and replied
      To all the propositions of surrender
    By mowing Christians down on every side,
      As obstinate as Swedish Charles at Bender.[469]
    His five brave boys no less the foe defied;
      Whereon the Russian pathos grew less tender
    As being a virtue, like terrestrial patience,[il]
    Apt to wear out on trifling provocations.

                      CVIII.

    And spite of Johnson and of Juan, who
      Expended all their Eastern phraseology
    In begging him, for God's sake, just to show
      So much less fight as might form an apology
    For _them_ in saving such a desperate foe--
      He hewed away, like Doctors of Theology
    When they dispute with sceptics; and with curses
    Struck at his friends, as babies beat their nurses.

                      CIX.

    Nay, he had wounded, though but slightly, both
      Juan and Johnson; whereupon they fell,
    The first with sighs, the second with an oath,
      Upon his angry Sultanship, pell-mell,
    And all around were grown exceeding wroth
      At such a pertinacious infidel,
    And poured upon him and his sons like rain,
    Which they resisted like a sandy plain

                      CX.

    That drinks and still is dry. At last they perished--
      His second son was levelled by a shot;
    His third was sabred; and the fourth, most cherished
      Of all the five, on bayonets met his lot;
    The fifth, who, by a Christian mother nourished,
      Had been neglected, ill-used, and what not,
    Because deformed, yet died all game and bottom,[im]
    To save a Sire who blushed that he begot him.

                      CXI.

    The eldest was a true and tameless Tartar,
      As great a scorner of the Nazarene
    As ever Mahomet picked out for a martyr,
      Who only saw the black-eyed girls in green,
    Who make the beds of those who won't take quarter
      On earth, in Paradise; and when once seen,
    Those houris, like all other pretty creatures,
    Do just whate'er they please, by dint of features.

                      CXII.

    And what they pleased to do with the young Khan
      In Heaven I know not, nor pretend to guess;
    But doubtless they prefer a fine young man
      To tough old heroes, and can do no less;[in]
    And that's the cause no doubt why, if we scan
      A field of battle's ghastly wilderness,
    For one rough, weather-beaten, veteran body,
    You'll find ten thousand handsome coxcombs bloody.

                      CXIII.

    Your houris also have a natural pleasure
      In lopping off your lately married men,
    Before the bridal hours have danced their measure
      And the sad, second moon grows dim again,
    Or dull Repentance hath had dreary leisure
      To wish him back a bachelor now and then:
    And thus your Houri (it may be) disputes
    Of these brief blossoms the immediate fruits.

                      CXIV.

    Thus the young Khan, with Houris in his sight,
      Thought not upon the charms of four young brides,
    But bravely rushed on his first heavenly night.
      In short, howe'er _our_ better faith derides,
    These black-eyed virgins make the Moslems fight,
      As though there were one Heaven and none besides--
    Whereas, if all be true we hear of Heaven
    And Hell, there must at least be six or seven.

                      CXV.

    So fully flashed the phantom on his eyes,
      That when the very lance was in his heart,
    He shouted "Allah!" and saw Paradise
      With all its veil of mystery drawn apart,
    And bright Eternity without disguise
      On his soul, like a ceaseless sunrise, dart:--
    With Prophets--Houris--Angels--Saints, descried
    In one voluptuous blaze,--and then he died,--[io]

                      CXVI.

    But with a heavenly rapture on his face.
      The good old Khan, who long had ceased to see
    Houris, or aught except his florid race,
      Who grew like cedars round him gloriously--
    When he beheld his latest hero grace
      The earth, which he became like a felled tree,
    Paused for a moment from the fight, and cast
    A glance on that slain son, his first and last.

                      CXVII.

    The soldiers, who beheld him drop his point,
      Stopped as if once more willing to concede
    Quarter, in case he bade them not "aroynt!"
      As he before had done. He did not heed
    Their pause nor signs: his heart was out of joint,
      And shook (till now unshaken) like a reed,
    As he looked down upon his children gone,
    And felt--though done with life--he was alone.[470]

                      CXVIII.

    But 't was a transient tremor:--with a spring
      Upon the Russian steel his breast he flung,
    As carelessly as hurls the moth her wing
      Against the light wherein she dies: he clung
    Closer, that all the deadlier they might wring,
      Unto the bayonets which had pierced his young;
    And throwing back a dim look on his sons,
    In one wide wound poured forth his soul at once.

                      CXIX.

    'T is strange enough--the rough, tough soldiers, who
      Spared neither sex nor age in their career
    Of carnage, when this old man was pierced through,
      And lay before them with his children near,
    Touched by the heroism of him they slew,
      Were melted for a moment; though no tear
    Flowed from their bloodshot eyes, all red with strife,
    They honoured such determined scorn of Life.

                      CXX.

    But the stone bastion still kept up its fire,
      Where the chief Pacha calmly held his post:
    Some twenty times he made the Russ retire,
      And baffled the assaults of all their host;
    At length he condescended to inquire
      If yet the city's rest were won or lost;
    And being told the latter, sent a Bey
    To answer Ribas' summons to give way.[471]

                      CXXI.

    In the mean time, cross-legged, with great sang-froid,
      Among the scorching ruins he sat smoking
    Tobacco on a little carpet;--Troy
      Saw nothing like the scene around;--yet looking
    With martial Stoicism, nought seemed to annoy
      His stern philosophy; but gently stroking
    His beard, he puffed his pipe's ambrosial gales,
    As if he had three lives, as well as tails.[472]
                      CXXII.

    The town was taken--whether he might yield
      Himself or bastion, little mattered now:
    His stubborn valour was no future shield.
      Ismail's no more! The Crescent's silver bow
    Sunk, and the crimson Cross glared o'er the field,
      But red with no _redeeming_ gore: the glow
    Of burning streets, like moonlight on the water,
    Was imaged back in blood, the sea of slaughter.[ip]

                      CXXIII.

    All that the mind would shrink from of excesses--
      All that the body perpetrates of bad;
    All that we read--hear--dream, of man's distresses--
      All that the Devil would do if run stark mad;
    All that defies the worst which pen expresses,--
      All by which Hell is peopled, or as sad
    As Hell--mere mortals who their power abuse--
    Was here (as heretofore and since) let loose.

                      CXXIV.

    If here and there some transient trait of pity
      Was shown, and some more noble heart broke through
    Its bloody bond, and saved, perhaps, some pretty
      Child, or an agéd, helpless man or two--
    What's this in one annihilated city,
      Where thousand loves, and ties, and duties grew?
    Cockneys of London! Muscadins of Paris!
    Just ponder what a pious pastime War is.[iq]

                      CXXV.

    Think how the joys of reading a Gazette
      Are purchased by all agonies and crimes:
    Or if these do not move you, don't forget
      Such doom may be your own in after-times.
    Meantime the Taxes, Castlereagh, and Debt,
      Are hints as good as sermons, or as rhymes.
    Read your own hearts and Ireland's present story,
    Then feed her famine fat with Wellesley's glory.

                      CXXVI.

    But still there is unto a patriot nation,
      Which loves so well its country and its King,
    A subject of sublimest exultation--
      Bear it, ye Muses, on your brightest wing!
    Howe'er the mighty locust, Desolation,
      Strip your green fields, and to your harvests cling,
    Gaunt famine never shall approach the throne--
    Though Ireland starve, great George weighs twenty stone.[473]

                      CXXVII.

    But let me put an end unto my theme:
      There was an end of Ismail--hapless town!
    Far flashed her burning towers o'er Danube's stream,
      And redly ran his blushing waters down.
    The horrid war-whoop and the shriller scream
      Rose still; but fainter were the thunders grown:
    Of forty thousand who had manned the wall,
    Some hundreds breathed--the rest were silent all![474]

                      CXXVIII.

    In one thing ne'ertheless 't is fit to praise
      The Russian army upon this occasion,
    A virtue much in fashion now-a-days,
      And therefore worthy of commemoration:[ir]
    The topic's tender, so shall be my phrase--
      Perhaps the season's chill, and their long station
    In Winter's depth, or want of rest and victual,
    Had made them chaste;--they ravished very little.

                      CXXIX.

    Much did they slay, more plunder, and no less
      Might here and there occur some violation
    In the other line;--but not to such excess
      As when the French, that dissipated nation,
    Take towns by storm: no causes can I guess,
      Except cold weather and commiseration;[is]
    But all the ladies, save some twenty score,
    Were almost as much virgins as before.

                      CXXX.

    Some odd mistakes, too, happened in the dark,
      Which showed a want of lanterns, or of taste--
    Indeed the smoke was such they scarce could mark
      Their friends from foes,--besides such things from haste
    Occur, though rarely, when there is a spark
      Of light to save the venerably chaste:
    But six old damsels, each of seventy years,
    Were all deflowered by different grenadiers.

                      CXXXI.

    But on the whole their continence was great;
      So that some disappointment there ensued
    To those who had felt the inconvenient state
      Of "single blessedness," and thought it good
    (Since it was not their fault, but only fate,
      To bear these crosses) for each waning prude
    To make a Roman sort of Sabine wedding,
    Without the expense and the suspense of bedding.

                      CXXII.

    Some voices of the buxom middle-aged
      Were also heard to wonder in the din
    (Widows of forty were these birds long caged)
      "Wherefore the ravishing did not begin!"
    But while the thirst for gore and plunder raged,
      There was small leisure for superfluous sin;
    But whether they escaped or no, lies hid
    In darkness--I can only hope they did.

                      CXXXIII.

    Suwarrow now was conqueror--a match
      For Timour or for Zinghis in his trade.
    While mosques and streets, beneath his eyes, like thatch
      Blazed, and the cannon's roar was scarce allayed,
    With bloody hands he wrote his first despatch;
      And here exactly follows what he said:--
    "Glory to _God_ and to the Empress!" (_Powers
    Eternal! such names mingled!_) "Ismail's ours."[475]

                      CXXXIV.

    Methinks these are the most tremendous words,
      Since "MENE, MENE, TEKEL," and "UPHARSIN,"
    Which hands or pens have ever traced of swords.
      Heaven help me! I'm but little of a parson:
    What Daniel read was short-hand of the Lord's,
      Severe, sublime; the prophet wrote no farce on
    The fate of nations;--but this Russ so witty
    Could rhyme, like Nero, o'er a burning city.

                      CXXXV.

    He wrote this Polar melody, and set it,
      Duly accompanied by shrieks and groans,
    Which few will sing, I trust, but none forget it--
      For I will teach, if possible, the stones
    To rise against Earth's tyrants. Never let it
      Be said that we still truckle unto thrones;--
    But ye--our children's children! think how we
    Showed _what things were_ before the World was free!

                      CXXXVI.

    That hour is not for us, but 't is for you:
      And as, in the great joy of your Millennium,
    You hardly will believe such things were true
      As now occur, I thought that I would pen you 'em;
    But may their very memory perish too!--
      Yet if perchance remembered, still disdain you 'em
    More than you scorn the savages of yore,
    Who _painted_ their _bare_ limbs, but _not_ with gore.

                      CXXXVII.

    And when you hear historians talk of thrones,
      And those that sate upon them, let it be
    As we now gaze upon the mammoth's bones,
      And wonder what old world such things could see,
    Or hieroglyphics on Egyptian stones,
      The pleasant riddles of futurity--
    Guessing at what shall happily be hid,
    As the real purpose of a pyramid.

                      CXXXVIII.

    Reader! I have kept my word,--at least so far
      As the first Canto promised. You have now
    Had sketches of Love--Tempest--Travel--War,--
      All very accurate, you must allow,
    And _Epic_, if plain truth should prove no bar;
      For I have drawn much less with a long bow
    Than my forerunners. Carelessly I sing,
    But Phoebus lends me now and then a string,

                      CXXXIX.

    With which I still can harp, and carp, and fiddle.
      What further hath befallen or may befall
    The hero of this grand poetic riddle,
      I by and by may tell you, if at all:
    But now I choose to break off in the middle,
      Worn out with battering Ismail's stubborn wall,
    While Juan is sent off with the despatch,
    For which all Petersburgh is on the watch.

                      CXL.

    This special honour was conferred, because
      He had behaved with courage and humanity--
    Which last men like, when they have time to pause
      From their ferocities produced by vanity.
    His little captive gained him some applause
      For saving her amidst the wild insanity
    Of carnage,--and I think he was more glad in her
    Safety, than his new order of St. Vladimir.

                      CXLI.

    The Moslem orphan went with her protector,
      For she was homeless, houseless, helpless; all
    Her friends, like the sad family of Hector,
      Had perished in the field or by the wall:
    Her very place of birth was but a spectre
      Of what it had been; there the Muezzin's call
    To prayer was heard no more!--and Juan wept,
    And made a vow to shield her, which he kept.

Louis François Duc de Richelieu, the Marshal of France (1696-1780),
served under Catherine II., and afterwards under the Czar Paul. On the
restoration of Louis XVIII. he entered the King's household; and after
the battle of Waterloo took office as President of the Council and
Minister for Foreign Affairs. His _Journal de mon Voyage en Allemagne_,
which was then unpublished, was placed at the disposal of the Marquis de
Castelnau (see _Hist. de la Nouvelle Russie_, 1827, i. 241). It has been
printed in full by the _Société Impériale d'Histoire de Russie_, 1886,
tom. liv. pp. 111-198. See for further mention of the manuscript, _Le
Duc de Richelieu_, par Raoul de Cisternes, 1898, Preface, p. 3, note 1.
He died May 17, 1822, two months before Cantos VI., VII., VIII. were
completed.]

[422] A fact: see the Waterloo Gazettes. I recollect remarking at the
time to a friend:--"_There_ is _fame!_ a man is killed, his name is
Grose, and they print it Grove." I was at college with the deceased, who
was a very amiable and clever man, and his society in great request for
his wit, gaiety, and "Chansons à boire."

[In the _London Gazette Extraordinary_ of June 22, 1815, Captain Grove,
1st Guards, is among the list of killed. In the supplement to the
_London Gazette_, published July 3, 1815, the mistake was corrected, and
the entry runs, "1st Guards, 3d Batt. Lieut. Edward Grose, (Captain)." I
am indebted to the courtesy of the Registrar of the University of
Cambridge for the information that Edward Grose matriculated at St.
John's College as a pensioner, December 7, 1805. Thanks to the
"misprint" in the _Gazette_, and to Byron, he is "a name for
ever."--_Vir nullâ non donatus lauru!_]

{337}[423] [At the Battle of Mollwitz, April 10, 1741, "the king
vanishes for sixteen hours into the regions of Myth 'into Fairyland,'
... of the king's flight ... the king himself, who alone could have told
us fully, maintained always rigorous silence, and nowhere drops the
least hint. So that the small fact has come down to us involved in a
great bulk of fabulous cobwebs, mostly of an ill-natured character, set
a-going by Voltaire, Valori, and others."--Carlyle's _Frederick the

[Charles Vallancey (1721-1812), general in the Royal Engineers,
published an "Essay on the Celtic Language," etc., in 1782. "The
language [the Iberno-Celtic]," he writes (p. 4), "we are now going to
explain, had such an affinity with the Punic, that it may be said to
have been, in a great degree, the language of Hanibal (_sic_), Hamilcar,
and of Asdrubal." Sir Laurence Parsons (1758-1841), second Earl of
Rosse, represented the University of Dublin 1782-90, and afterwards
King's County, in the Irish House of Commons. He was an opponent of the
Union. In a pamphlet entitled _Defence of the Antient History of
Ireland_, published in 1795, he maintains (p. 158) "that the
Carthaginian and the Irish language being originally the same, either
the Carthaginians must have been descended from the Irish, or the Irish
from the Carthaginians."]

surrounded the twelfth and the seventh legions, and killed all the
officers. Had not Cæsar snatched a buckler from one of his own men,
forced his way through the combatants before him, and rushed upon the

[442] [Daniel Boone (1735-1820) was the grandson of an English settler,
George Boone, of Exeter. His great work in life was the conquest of
Kentucky. Following in the steps of another pioneer, John Finley, he
left his home in North Carolina in May, 1769, and, after numerous
adventures, effected a settlement on the Kentucky river. He constructed
a fort, which he named Boonesborough, and carried on a protracted
campaign with varying but final success against the Indians. When
Kentucky was admitted into the Union, February 4, 1791, he failed to
make good his title to his property at Boonesborough, and withdrew to
Mount Pleasant, beyond the Ohio. Thence, in 1795, he removed to
Missouri, then a Spanish possession. Napoleon wrested Missouri from the
Spaniards, only to sell the territory to the United States, with the
result that in 1810 he was confirmed in the possession of 850 out of the
8000 acres which he had acquired in 1795. "Boone was then seventy-five
years of age, hale and strong. The charm of the hunter's life clung to
him to the last, and in his eighty-second year he went on a hunting
excursion to the mouth of the Kansas river."--Appleton's _Encyclopedia,
etc_., art. "Boone." His fine and gracious nature reveals itself in his
autobiography (_The Adventures of Colonel Daniel Boon, Formerly a
Hunter; Containing a Narrative of the Wars of Kentucky_; Imlay's _North
America_, 1793, ii. 52-54). "One day," he writes (pp. 330, _sq_.), "I
undertook a tour through the country, and the diversity and beauties of
nature ... expelled every gloomy and vexatious thought. Just at the
close of day the gentle gales retired, and left the place to the
disposal of a profound calm. Not a breeze shook the most tremulous leaf.
I had gained the summit of a commanding ridge, and, looking round with
astonishing delight, beheld the ample plains, the beauteous tracts
below. On the other hand, I surveyed the famous river Ohio, that rolled
in silent dignity, marking the western boundary of Kentucky with
inconceivable grandeur. ... All things were still. I kindled a fire near
a fountain of sweet water, and feasted on the loins of a buck, which a
few hours before I had killed.... No populous city, with all the
varieties of commerce and stately structures, could afford so much
pleasure to my mind as the beauties of nature I found here." (See, too,

{370}[475] In the original Russian--

    "Slava bogu! slava vam!
    Krépost vzata i ya tam;"

a kind of couplet; for he was a poet.

[J.H. Castéra (_Vie de Catherine II._, 1797, ii. 374) relates this
incident in connection with the fall of Turtukey (or Tutrakaw) in
Bulgaria, giving the words in French, "Gloire à Dieu! Louange à
Catherine! Toutoukai est pris. Souwaroff y est entré." W. Tooke (_Life
of Catherine II._, 1800, iii. 278). Castéra's translator, gives the
original Russian with an English version. But according to Spalding
(_Suvóroff_, 1890, pp. 42, 43), the words, which were written on a scrap
of paper, and addressed to Soltikoff, ran thus: "Your Excellency, we
have conquered. Glory to God! Glory to you! Alexander Suvóroff." When
Ismail was taken he wrote to Potemkin, "The Russian standard floats
above the walls of Ismail," and to the Empress, "Proud Ismail lies at
your Majesty's feet." The tenour of the poetical message on the fall of
Tutrakaw recalls the triumphant piety of the Emperor William I. of
Germany. See, too, for "mad Suwarrow's rhymes," Canto IX. stanza lx.

                 CANTO THE NINTH.

                      I.[476]

    Oh, Wellington! (or "Villainton"[477]--for Fame[it]
      Sounds the heroic syllables both ways;
    France could not even conquer your great name,
      But punned it down to this facetious phrase--
    Beating or beaten she will laugh the same,)
      You have obtained great pensions and much praise:
    Glory like yours should any dare gainsay,
    Humanity would rise, and thunder "Nay!"[478]

                      II.

    I don't think that you used Kinnaird quite well
      In Marinèt's affair[479]--in fact, 't was shabby,
    And like some other things won't do to tell
      Upon your tomb in Westminster's old Abbey.
    Upon the rest 't is not worth while to dwell,
      Such tales being for the tea-hours of some tabby;[480]
    But though your years as _man_ tend fast to zero,
    In fact your Grace is still but a _young Hero_.

                      III.

    Though Britain owes (and pays you too) so much,
      Yet Europe doubtless owes you greatly more:
    You have repaired Legitimacy's crutch,
      A prop not quite so certain as before:
    The Spanish, and the French, as well as Dutch,
      Have seen, and felt, how strongly you _restore_;
    And Waterloo has made the world your debtor
    (I wish your bards would sing it rather better).

                      IV.

    You are "the best of cut-throats:"[481]--do not start;
      The phrase is Shakespeare's, and not misapplied:--
    War's a brain-spattering, windpipe-slitting art,
      Unless her cause by right be sanctified.
    If you have acted _once_ a generous part,
      The World, not the World's masters, will decide,
    And I shall be delighted to learn who,
    Save you and yours, have gained by Waterloo?

                      V.

    I am no flatterer--you've supped full of flattery:[482]
      They say you like it too--'t is no great wonder.
    He whose whole life has been assault and battery,
      At last may get a little tired of thunder;
    And swallowing eulogy much more than satire, he
      May like being praised for every lucky blunder,
    Called "Saviour of the Nations"--not yet saved,--
    And "Europe's Liberator"--still enslaved.[483]

                      VI.

    I've done. Now go and dine from off the plate
      Presented by the Prince of the Brazils,
    And send the sentinel before your gate
      A slice or two from your luxurious meals:[484]
    He fought, but has not fed so well of late.
      Some hunger, too, they say the people feels:--
    There is no doubt that you deserve your ration,
    But pray give back a little to the nation.

                      VII.

    I don't mean to reflect--a man so great as
      You, my lord Duke! is far above reflection:
    The high Roman fashion, too, of Cincinnatus,
      With modern history has but small connection:
    Though as an Irishman you love potatoes,
      You need not take them under your direction;
    And half a million for your Sabine farm
    Is rather dear!--I'm sure I mean no harm.

                      VIII.

    Great men have always scorned great recompenses:
      Epaminondas saved his Thebes, and died,
    Not leaving even his funeral expenses:[485]
      George Washington had thanks, and nought beside,
    Except the all-cloudless glory (which few men's is)
      To free his country: Pitt too had his pride,
    And as a high-souled Minister of state is
    Renowned for ruining Great Britain gratis.[486]

                      IX.

    Never had mortal man such opportunity,
      Except Napoleon, or abused it more:
    You might have freed fallen Europe from the unity
      Of Tyrants, and been blest from shore to shore:
    And _now_--what is your fame? Shall the Muse tune it ye?
      _Now_--that the rabble's first vain shouts are o'er?
    Go! hear it in your famished country's cries!
    Behold the World! and curse your victories!

                      X.

    As these new cantos touch on warlike feats,
      To _you_ the unflattering Muse deigns to inscribe[iu]
    Truths, that you will not read in the Gazettes,
      But which 't is time to teach the hireling tribe
    Who fatten on their country's gore, and debts,
      Must be recited--and without a bribe.
    You _did great_ things, but not being _great_ in mind,
    Have left _undone_ the _greatest_--and mankind.

                      XI.

    Death laughs--Go ponder o'er the skeleton
      With which men image out the unknown thing
    That hides the past world, like to a set sun
      Which still elsewhere may rouse a brighter spring--
    Death laughs at all you weep for!--look upon
      This hourly dread of all! whose _threatened sting_
    Turns Life to terror, even though in its sheath:
    Mark! how its lipless mouth grins without breath!

                      XII.

    Mark! how it laughs and scorns at all you are!
      And yet _was_ what you are; from _ear_ to _ear_
    It _laughs not_--there is now no fleshy bar
     So called; the Antic long hath ceased to _hear_,
    But still he _smiles_; and whether near or far,
      He strips from man that mantle (far more dear
    Than even the tailor's), his incarnate skin,[iv]
    White, black, or copper--the dead bones will grin.

                      XIII.

    And thus Death laughs,--it is sad merriment,
      But still it _is_ so; and with such example
    Why should not Life be equally content
      With his Superior, in a smile to trample
    Upon the nothings which are daily spent
      Like bubbles on an Ocean much less ample
    Than the Eternal Deluge, which devours
    Suns as rays--worlds like atoms--years like hours?

                      XIV.

    "To be, or not to be? _that_ is the question,"
      Says Shakespeare,[487] who just now is much in fashion.
    I am neither Alexander nor Hephæstion,
      Nor ever had for _abstract_ fame much passion;
    But would much rather have a sound digestion
      Than Buonaparte's cancer:--could I dash on
    Through fifty victories to shame or fame--
    Without a stomach what were a good name?

                      XV.

    _"O dura ilia messorum!"_[488]--"Oh
      Ye rigid guts of reapers!" I translate[iw]
    For the great benefit of those who know
      What indigestion is--that inward fate
    Which makes all Styx through one small liver flow.
      A peasant's sweat is worth his lord's estate:
    Let _this_ one toil for bread--_that_ rack for rent,
    He who sleeps best may be the most content.

                      XVI.

    "To be, or not to be?"--Ere I decide,
      I should be glad to know that which _is being_.
    'T is true we speculate both far and wide,
      And deem, because we _see_, we are _all-seeing_:
    For my part, I'll enlist on neither side,
      Until I see both sides for once agreeing.
    For me, I sometimes think that Life is Death,
    Rather than Life a mere affair of breath.

                      XVII.

    _"Que scais-je"_[489] was the motto of Montaigne,
      As also of the first academicians:
    That all is dubious which man may attain,
      Was one of their most favourite positions.
    There's no such thing as certainty, that's plain
      As any of Mortality's conditions;
    So little do we know what we're about in
    This world, I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.

                      XVIII.

    It is a pleasant voyage perhaps to float,
      Like Pyrrho,[490] on a sea of speculation;
    But what if carrying sail capsize the boat?
      Your wise men don't know much of navigation;
    And swimming long in the abyss of thought
      Is apt to tire: a calm and shallow station
    Well nigh the shore, where one stoops down and gathers
    Some pretty shell, is best for moderate bathers.

                      XIX.

    "But Heaven," as Cassio says, "is above all--[491]
      No more of this, then, let us pray!" We have
    Souls to save, since Eve's slip and Adam's fall,
      Which tumbled all mankind into the grave,
    Besides fish, beasts, and birds. "The sparrow's fall
      Is special providence,"[492] though how _it_ gave
    Offence, we know not; probably it perched
    Upon the tree which Eve so fondly searched.

                      XX.

    Oh! ye immortal Gods! what is Theogony?
      Oh! thou, too, mortal man! what is Philanthropy?
    Oh! World, which was and is, what is Cosmogony?
      Some people have accused me of Misanthropy;
    And yet I know no more than the mahogany
      That forms this desk, of what they mean;--_Lykanthropy_[493]
    I comprehend, for without transformation
    Men become wolves on any slight occasion.

                      XXI.

    But I, the mildest, meekest of mankind,
      Like Moses, or Melancthon,[494] who have ne'er[ix]
    Done anything exceedingly unkind,--
      And (though I could not now and then forbear
    Following the bent of body or of mind)
      Have always had a tendency to spare,--
    Why do they call me Misanthrope? Because
    _They hate me, not I them:_--and here we'll pause.

                      XXII.

    'T is time we should proceed with our good poem,--
      For I maintain that it is really good,
    Not only in the body but the proem,
      However little both are understood
    Just now,--but by and by the Truth will show 'em
      Herself in her sublimest attitude:
    And till she doth, I fain must be content
    To share her beauty and her banishment.

                      XXIII.

    Our hero (and, I trust, kind reader! yours)
      Was left upon his way to the chief city
    Of the immortal Peter's polished boors,
      Who still have shown themselves more brave than witty.
    I know its mighty Empire now allures
      Much flattery--even Voltaire's,[495] and that's a pity.
    For me, I deem an absolute autocrat
    _Not_ a barbarian, but much worse than that.

                      XXIV.

    And I will war, at least in words (and--should
      My chance so happen--deeds), with all who war
    With Thought;--and of Thought's foes by far most rude,
      Tyrants and sycophants have been and are.
    I know not who may conquer: if I could
      Have such a prescience, it should be no bar
    To this my plain, sworn, downright detestation
    Of every despotism in every nation.[iy]

                      XXV.

    It is not that I adulate the people:
      Without _me_, there are demagogues enough,[496]
    And infidels, to pull down every steeple,
      And set up in their stead some proper stuff.
    Whether they may sow scepticism to reap Hell,
      As is the Christian dogma rather rough,
    I do not know;--I wish men to be free
    As much from mobs as kings--from you as me.

                      XXVI.

    The consequence is, being of no party,
      I shall offend all parties:--never mind!
    My words, at least, are more sincere and hearty
      Than if I sought to sail before the wind.
    He who has nought to gain can have small art: he
      Who neither wishes to be bound nor bind,
    May still expatiate freely, as will I,
    Nor give my voice to slavery's jackal cry.[iz]

                      XXVII.

    _That's_ an appropriate simile, _that jackal;_--
      I've heard them in the Ephesian ruins howl[497]
    By night, as do that mercenary pack all,
      Power's base purveyors, who for pickings prowl,
    And scent the prey their masters would attack all.
      However, the poor jackals are less foul
    (As being the brave lions' keen providers)
    Than human insects, catering for spiders.[ja]

                      XXVIII.

    Raise but an arm! 't will brush their web away,
      And without _that_, their poison and their claws
    Are useless. Mind, good people! what I say--
      (Or rather Peoples)--_go on_ without pause!
    The web of these Tarantulas each day
      Increases, till you shall make common cause:
    None, save the Spanish Fly and Attic Bee,
    As yet are strongly stinging to be free.[jb]

                      XXIX.

    Don Juan, who had shone in the late slaughter,
      Was left upon his way with the despatch,
    Where blood was talked of as we would of water;
      And carcasses that lay as thick as thatch
    O'er silenced cities, merely served to flatter
      Fair Catherine's pastime--who looked on the match
    Between these nations as a main of cocks,
    Wherein she liked her own to stand like rocks.

                      XXX.

    And there in a _kibitka_ he rolled on,
      (A cursed sort of carriage without springs,
    Which on rough roads leaves scarcely a whole bone,)
      Pondering on Glory, Chivalry, and Kings,
    And Orders, and on all that he had done--
      And wishing that post-horses had the wings
    Of Pegasus, or at the least post-chaises
    Had feathers, when a traveller on deep ways is.

                      XXXI.

    At every jolt--and they were many--still
      He turned his eyes upon his little charge,
    As if he wished that she should fare less ill
      Than he, in these sad highways left at large
    To ruts, and flints, and lovely Nature's skill,
      Who is no paviour, nor admits a barge
    On _her_ canals, where God takes sea and land,
    Fishery and farm, both into his own hand.

                      XXXII.

    At least he pays no rent, and has best right
      To be the first of what we used to call
    "Gentlemen farmers"--a race worn out quite,
      Since lately there have been no rents at all,
    And "gentlemen" are in a piteous plight,
      And "farmers" can't raise Ceres from her fall:
    She fell with Buonaparte,[498]--What strange thoughts
    Arise, when we see Emperors fall with oats!

                      XXXIII.

    But Juan turned his eyes on the sweet child
      Whom he had saved from slaughter--what a trophy
    Oh! ye who build up monuments, defiled
      With gore, like Nadir Shah,[499] that costive Sophy,
    Who, after leaving Hindostan a wild,
      And scarce to the Mogul a cup of coffee
    To soothe his woes withal, was slain, the sinner!
    Because he could no more digest his dinner;--[jc][500]

                      XXXIV.

    Oh ye! or we! or he! or she! reflect,
      That _one_ life saved, especially if young
    Or pretty, is a thing to recollect
      Far sweeter than the greenest laurels sprung
    From the manure of human clay, though decked
      With all the praises ever said or sung:
    Though hymned by every harp, unless within
    Your heart joins chorus, Fame is but a din.

                      XXXV.

    Oh! ye great authors luminous, voluminous!
      Ye twice ten hundred thousand daily scribes!
    Whose pamphlets, volumes, newspapers, illumine us!
      Whether you're paid by government in bribes,
    To prove the public debt is not consuming us--
      Or, roughly treading on the "courtier's kibes"
    With clownish heel[501] your popular circulation
    Feeds you by printing half the realm's starvation;--

                      XXXVI.

    Oh, ye great authors!--_A propos des bottes,_--
      I have forgotten what I meant to say,
    As sometimes have been greater sages' lots;--
      'T was something calculated to allay
    All wrath in barracks, palaces, or cots:
      Certes it would have been but thrown away,
    And that's one comfort for my lost advice,
    Although no doubt it was beyond all price.

                      XXXVII.

    But let it go:--it will one day be found
      With other relics of "a former World,"
    When this World shall be _former,_ underground,
      Thrown topsy-turvy, twisted, crisped, and curled,
    Baked, fried, or burnt, turned inside-out, or drowned,
      Like all the worlds before, which have been hurled
    First out of, and then back again to chaos--
    The superstratum which will overlay us.[jd]

                      XXXVIII.

    So Cuvier says:[502]--and then shall come again
      Unto the new creation, rising out
    From our old crash, some mystic, ancient strain
      Of things destroyed and left in airy doubt;
    Like to the notions we now entertain
      Of Titans, giants, fellows of about
    Some hundred feet in height, _not_ to say _miles,_
    And mammoths, and your winged crocodiles.

                      XXXIX.

    Think if then George the Fourth should be dug up![503]
      How the new worldlings of the then new East
    Will wonder where such animals could sup!
      (For they themselves will be but of the least:
    Even worlds miscarry, when too oft they pup,
      And every new creation hath decreased
    In size, from overworking the material--
    Men are but maggots of some huge Earth's burial.)

                      XL.

    _How_ will--to these young people, just thrust out
      From some fresh Paradise, and set to plough,
    And dig, and sweat, and turn themselves about,
      And plant, and reap, and spin, and grind, and sow,
    Till all the arts at length are brought about,
      Especially of War and taxing,--_how_,
    I say, will these great relics, when they see 'em,
    Look like the monsters of a new Museum!

                      XLI.

    But I am apt to grow too metaphysical:
      "The time is out of joint,"[504]--and so am I;
    I quite forget this poem's merely quizzical,
      And deviate into matters rather dry.
    I ne'er decide what I shall say, and this I call[je]
      Much too poetical: men should know why
    They write, and for what end; but, note or text,
    I never know the word which will come next.

                      XLII.

    So on I ramble, now and then narrating,
      Now pondering:--it is time we should narrate.
    I left Don Juan with his horses baiting--
      Now we'll get o'er the ground at a great rate:
    I shall not be particular in stating
      His journey, we've so many tours of late:
    Suppose him then at Petersburgh; suppose
    That pleasant capital of painted snows;[505]

                      XLIII.

    Suppose him in a handsome uniform--
      A scarlet coat, black facings, a long plume,
    Waving, like sails new shivered in a storm,
      Over a cocked hat in a crowded room,
    And brilliant breeches, bright as a Cairn Gorme,
      Of yellow casimire we may presume,
    White stockings drawn uncurdled as new milk
    O'er limbs whose symmetry set off the silk;[jf]

                      XLIV.

    Suppose him sword by side, and hat in hand,
      Made up by Youth, Fame, and an army tailor--
    That great enchanter, at whose rod's command
      Beauty springs forth, and Nature's self turns paler,
    Seeing how Art can make her work more grand
      (When she don't pin men's limbs in like a gaoler),--
    Behold him placed as if upon a pillar! He[jg]
    Seems Love turned a Lieutenant of Artillery![506]

                      XLV.

    His bandage slipped down into a cravat--
      His wings subdued to epaulettes--his quiver
    Shrunk to a scabbard, with his arrows at
      His side as a small sword, but sharp as ever--
    His bow converted into a cocked hat--
      But still so like, that Psyche were more clever
    Than some wives (who make blunders no less stupid),
    If she had not mistaken him for Cupid.

                      XLVI.

    The courtiers stared, the ladies whispered, and
      The Empress smiled: the reigning favourite frowned--[jh]
    I quite forget which of them was in hand
      Just then, as they are rather numerous found,[507]
    Who took, by turns, that difficult command
      Since first her Majesty was singly crowned:[508]
    But they were mostly nervous six-foot fellows,
    All fit to make a Patagonian jealous.

                      XLVII.

    Juan was none of these, but slight and slim,
      Blushing and beardless; and, yet, ne'ertheless,
    There was a something in his turn of limb,
      And still more in his eye, which seemed to express,
    That, though he looked one of the Seraphim,
      There lurked a man beneath the Spirit's dress.
    Besides, the Empress sometimes liked a boy,
    And had just buried the fair-faced Lanskoi.[ji][509]

                      XLVIII.

    No wonder then that Yermoloff, or Momonoff,[510]
      Or Scherbatoff, or any other _off_
    Or _on_, might dread her Majesty had not room enough
      Within her bosom (which was not too tough),
    For a new flame; a thought to cast of gloom enough
      Along the aspect, whether smooth or rough,
    Of him who, in the language of his station,
    Then held that "high official situation."

                      XLIX.

    O gentle ladies! should you seek to know
      The import of this diplomatic phrase,
    Bid Ireland's Londonderry's Marquess[511] show
      His parts of speech, and in the strange displays
    Of that odd string of words, all in a row,
      Which none divine, and every one obeys,
    Perhaps you may pick out some queer _no_ meaning,--
    Of that weak wordy harvest the sole gleaning.

                      L.

    I think I can explain myself without
      That sad inexplicable beast of prey--
    That Sphinx, whose words would ever be a doubt,
      Did not his deeds unriddle them each day--
    That monstrous hieroglyphic--that long spout
      Of blood and water--leaden Castlereagh!
    And here I must an anecdote relate,
    But luckily of no great length or weight.

                      LI.

    An English lady asked of an Italian,
      What were the actual and official duties
    Of the strange thing some women set a value on,
      Which hovers oft about some married beauties,
    Called "Cavalier Servente?"[512]--a Pygmalion
      Whose statues warm (I fear, alas! too true 't is)
    Beneath his art:[jj]--the dame, pressed to disclose them,
    Said--"Lady, I beseech you to _suppose them_."

                      LII.

    And thus I supplicate your supposition,
      And mildest, matron-like interpretation,
    Of the imperial favourite's condition.
      'T was a high place, the highest in the nation
    In fact, if not in rank; and the suspicion
      Of any one's attaining to his station,
    No doubt gave pain, where each new pair of shoulders,
    If rather broad, made stocks rise--and their holders.

                      LIII.

    Juan, I said, was a most beauteous boy,
      And had retained his boyish look beyond
    The usual hirsute seasons which destroy,
      With beards and whiskers, and the like, the fond
    _Parisian_ aspect, which upset old Troy
      And founded Doctors' Commons:[jk]--I have conned
    The history of divorces, which, though chequered,
    Calls Ilion's the first damages on record.

                      LIV.

    And Catherine, who loved all things (save her Lord,
      Who was gone to his place), and passed for much,
    Admiring those (by dainty dames abhorred)
      Gigantic gentlemen, yet had a touch
    Of sentiment: and he she most adored
      Was the lamented Lanskoi, who was such
    A lover as had cost her many a tear,
    And yet but made a middling grenadier.

                      LV.

    Oh thou "_teterrima causa_" of all "_belli_"--[513]
      Thou gate of Life and Death--thou nondescript!
    Whence is our exit and our entrance,--well I
      May pause in pondering how all souls are dipped
    In thy perennial fountain:--how man _fell_ I
      Know not, since Knowledge saw her branches stripped
    Of her first fruit; but how he _falls_ and rises
    Since,--_thou_ hast settled beyond all surmises.

                      LVI.

    Some call thee "the _worst_ cause of War," but I
      Maintain thou art the _best_.--for after all,
    From thee we come, to thee we go, and why
      To get at thee not batter down a wall,
    Or waste a World? since no one can deny
      Thou dost replenish worlds both great and small:
    With--or without thee--all things at a stand[jl]
    Are, or would be, thou sea of Life's dry land![jm]

                      LVII.

    Catherine, who was the grand Epitome
      Of that great cause of War, or Peace, or what
    You please (it causes all the things which be,
      So you may take your choice of this or that)--
    Catherine, I say, was very glad to see
      The handsome herald, on whose plumage sat[514]
    Victory; and, pausing as she saw him kneel
    With his despatch, forgot to break the seal.

                      LVIII.

    Then recollecting the whole Empress, nor
      Forgetting quite the Woman (which composed
    At least three parts of this great whole), she tore
      The letter open with an air which posed
    The Court, that watched each look her visage wore,
      Until a royal smile at length disclosed
    Fair weather for the day. Though rather spacious,
    Her face was noble, her eyes fine, mouth gracious.[515]

                      LIX.

    Great joy was hers, or rather joys: the first
      Was a ta'en city, thirty thousand slain:
    Glory and triumph o'er her aspect burst,
      As an East Indian sunrise on the main:--
    These quenched a moment her Ambition's thirst--
      So Arab deserts drink in Summer's rain:
    In vain!--As fall the dews on quenchless sands,
    Blood only serves to wash Ambition's hands!

                      LX.

    Her next amusement was more fanciful;
      She smiled at mad Suwarrow's rhymes, who threw
    Into a Russian couplet rather dull
      The whole gazette of thousands whom he slew:
    Her third was feminine enough to annul
      The shudder which runs naturally through
    Our veins, when things called Sovereigns think it best
    To kill, and Generals turn it into jest.

                      LXI.

    The two first feelings ran their course complete,
      And lighted first her eye, and then her mouth:
    The whole court looked immediately most sweet,
      Like flowers well watered after a long drouth:--
    But when on the Lieutenant at her feet
      Her Majesty, who liked to gaze on youth
    Almost as much as on a new despatch,
    Glanced mildly,--all the world was on the watch.

                      LXII.

    Though somewhat large, exuberant, and truculent,
      When _wroth_--while _pleased_, she was as fine a figure
    As those who like things rosy, ripe, and succulent,
      Would wish to look on, while they are in vigour.
    She could repay each amatory look you lent
      With interest, and, in turn, was wont with rigour
    To exact of Cupid's bills the full amount
    At sight, nor would permit you to discount.

                      LXIII.

    With her the latter, though at times convenient,
      Was not so necessary; for they tell
    That she was handsome, and though fierce _looked_ lenient,
      And always used her favourites too well.
    If once beyond her boudoir's precincts in ye went,
      Your "fortune" was in a fair way "to swell
    A man" (as Giles says);[516] for though she would widow all
    Nations, she liked Man as an individual.

                      LXIV.

    What a strange thing is Man! and what a stranger
      Is Woman! What a whirlwind is her head,
    And what a whirlpool full of depth and danger
      Is all the rest about her! Whether wed,
    Or widow--maid--or mother, she can change her
      Mind like the wind: whatever she has said
    Or done, is light to what she'll say or do;--
    The oldest thing on record, and yet new!

                      LXV.

    Oh Catherine! (for of all interjections,
      To thee both _oh!_ and _ah!_ belong, of right,
    In Love and War) how odd are the connections
      Of human thoughts, which jostle in their flight!
    Just now _yours_ were cut out in different sections:
      _First_ Ismail's capture caught your fancy quite;
    _Next_ of new knights, the fresh and glorious batch:
    And _thirdly_ he who brought you the despatch!

                      LXVI.

    Shakespeare talks of "the herald Mercury
      New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:"[517]
    And some such visions crossed her Majesty,
      While her young herald knelt before her still.
    'T is very true the hill seemed rather high,
      For a Lieutenant to climb up; but skill
    Smoothed even the Simplon's steep, and by God's blessing,
    With Youth and Health all kisses are "Heaven-kissing."

                      LXVII.

    Her Majesty looked down, the youth looked up--
      And so they fell in love;--she with his face,
    His grace, his God-knows-what: for Cupid's cup
      With the first draught intoxicates apace,
    A quintessential laudanum or "Black Drop,"
      Which makes one drunk at once, without the base
    Expedient of full bumpers; for the eye
    In love drinks all Life's fountains (save tears) dry.

                      LXVIII.

    He, on the other hand, if not in love,
      Fell into that no less imperious passion,
    Self-love--which, when some sort of thing above
      Ourselves, a singer, dancer, much in fashion,
    Or Duchess--Princess--Empress, "deigns to prove"[518]
      ('T is Pope's phrase) a great longing, though a rash one,
    For one especial person out of many,
    Make us believe ourselves as good as any.

                      LXIX.

    Besides, he was of that delighted age
      Which makes all female ages equal--when
    We don't much care with whom we may engage,
      As bold as Daniel in the lions' den,
    So that we can our native sun assuage
      In the next ocean, which may flow just then--
    To make a _twilight_ in, just as Sol's heat is
    Quenched in the lap of the salt sea, or Thetis.

                      LXX.

    And Catherine (we must say thus much for Catherine),
      Though bold and bloody, was the kind of thing
    Whose temporary passion was quite flattering,
      Because each lover looked a sort of King,
    Made up upon an amatory pattern,
      A royal husband in all save the _ring_--[jn]
    Which, (being the damnedest part of matrimony,)
    Seemed taking out the sting to leave the honey:

                      LXXI.

    And when you add to this, her Womanhood
      In its meridian, her blue eyes[519] or gray--
    (The last, if they have soul, are quite as good,
      Or better, as the best examples say:
    Napoleon's, Mary's[520] (Queen of Scotland), should
      Lend to that colour a transcendent ray;
    And Pallas also sanctions the same hue,
    Too wise to look through optics black or blue)--

                      LXXII.

    Her sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,[jo]
      Her plumpness, her imperial condescension,
    Her preference of a boy to men much bigger
      (Fellows whom Messalina's self would pension),
    Her prime of life, just now in juicy vigour,
      With other _extras_, which we need not mention,--
    All these, or any one of these, explain
    Enough to make a stripling very vain.

                      LXXIII.

    And that's enough, for Love is vanity,
      Selfish in its beginning as its end,[jp]
    Except where 't is a mere insanity,
      A maddening spirit which would strive to blend
    Itself with Beauty's frail inanity,
      On which the Passion's self seems to depend;
    And hence some heathenish philosophers
    Make Love the main-spring of the Universe.

                      LXXIV.

    Besides Platonic love, besides the love
      Of God, the love of sentiment, the loving
    Of faithful pairs--(I needs must rhyme with dove,
      That good old steam-boat which keeps verses moving
    'Gainst reason--Reason ne'er was hand-and-glove
      With rhyme, but always leant less to improving
    The sound than sense)--besides all these pretences
    To Love, there are those things which words name senses;

                      LXXV.

    Those movements, those improvements in our bodies
      Which make all bodies anxious to get out
    Of their own sand-pits, to mix with a goddess,
      For such all women are at first no doubt.[jq]
    How beautiful that moment! and how odd is
      That fever which precedes the languid rout
    Of our sensations! What a curious way
    The whole thing is of clothing souls in clay![jr]

                      LXXVI.[521]

    The noblest kind of love is love Platonical,
      To end or to begin with; the next grand
    Is that which may be christened love canonical,
      Because the clergy take the thing in hand;
    The third sort to be noted in our chronicle
      As flourishing in every Christian land,
    Is when chaste matrons to their other ties
    Add what may be called _marriage in disguise_.

                      LXXVII.

    Well, we won't analyse--our story must
      Tell for itself: the Sovereign was smitten,
    Juan much flattered by her love, or lust;--
      I cannot stop to alter words once written,
    And the _two_ are so mixed with human dust,
      That he who _names one_, both perchance may hit on:
    But in such matters Russia's mighty Empress
    Behaved no better than a common sempstress.

                      LXXVIII.

    The whole court melted into one wide whisper,
      And all lips were applied unto all ears!
    The elder ladies' wrinkles curled much crisper
      As they beheld; the younger cast some leers
    On one another, and each lovely lisper
      Smiled as she talked the matter o'er; but tears
    Of rivalship rose in each clouded eye
    Of all the standing army who stood by.

                      LXXIX.

    All the ambassadors of all the powers
      Inquired, Who was this very new young man,
    Who promised to be great in some few hours?
      Which is full soon (though Life is but a span).
    Already they beheld the silver showers
      Of rubles rain, as fast as specie can,
    Upon his cabinet, besides the presents
    Of several ribands, and some thousand peasants.[522]

                      LXXX.

    Catherine was generous,--all such ladies are:
      Love--that great opener of the heart and all
    The ways that lead there, be they near or far,
      Above, below, by turnpikes great or small,--
    Love--(though she had a cursed taste for War,
      And was not the best wife unless we call
    Such Clytemnestra, though perhaps 't is better
    That one should die--than two drag on the fetter)--

                      LXXXI.

    Love had made Catherine make each lover's fortune,
      Unlike our own half-chaste Elizabeth,
    Whose avarice all disbursements did importune,
      If History, the grand liar, ever saith
    The truth; and though grief her old age might shorten,
      Because she put a favourite to death,
    Her vile, ambiguous method of flirtation,
    And stinginess, disgrace her sex and station.

                      LXXXII.

    But when the levée rose, and all was bustle
      In the dissolving circle, all the nations'
    Ambassadors began as 't were to hustle
      Round the young man with their congratulations.
    Also the softer silks were heard to rustle
      Of gentle dames, among whose recreations
    It is to speculate on handsome faces,
    Especially when such lead to high places.

                      LXXXIII.

    Juan, who found himself, he knew not how,
      A general object of attention, made
    His answers with a very graceful bow,
      As if born for the ministerial trade.
    Though modest, on his unembarrassed brow
      Nature had written "Gentleman!" He said
    Little, but to the purpose; and his manner
    Flung hovering graces o'er him like a banner.

                      LXXXIV.

    An order from her Majesty consigned
      Our young Lieutenant to the genial care
    Of those in office: all the world looked kind,
      (As it will look sometimes with the first stare,
    Which Youth would not act ill to keep in mind,)
      As also did Miss Protasoff[523] then there,[js]
    Named from her mystic office "l'Eprouveuse,"
    A term inexplicable to the Muse.

                      LXXXV.

    With _her_ then, as in humble duty bound,
      Juan retired,--and so will I, until
    My Pegasus shall tire of touching ground.
      We have just lit on a "heaven-kissing hill,"
    So lofty that I feel my brain turn round,
      And all my fancies whirling like a mill;
    Which is a signal to my nerves and brain,
    To take a quiet ride in some green lane.[524]

August 5, and shot December 7, 1815.]

[479] [The story of the attempted assassination (February 11, 1818) of
the Duke of Wellington, which is dismissed by Alison in a few words
(_Hist. of Europe_ (1815-1852), 1853, i. 577, 578), occupies many pages
of the _Supplementary Despatches_ (1865, xii. 271-546). Byron probably
drew his own conclusions as to the Kinnaird-Marinet incident, from the
_Letter to the Duke of Wellington on the Arrest of M. Marinet_, by Lord
Kinnaird, 1818. The story, which is full of interest, may be briefly
recounted. On January 30, 1818, Lord Kinnaird informed Sir George Murray
(Chief of the Staff of the Army of Occupation) that a person, whose name
he withheld, had revealed to him the existence of a plot to assassinate
the Duke of Wellington. At 12.30 a.m., February 11, 1818, the Duke, on
returning to his Hotel, was fired at by an unknown person; and then, but
not till then, he wrote to urge Lord Clancarty to advise the Prince
Regent to take steps to persuade or force Kinnaird to disclose the name
of his informant. A Mr. G.W. Chad, of the Consular Service, was
empowered to proceed to Brussels, and to seek an interview with
Kinnaird. He carried with him, among other documents, a letter from the
Duke to Lord Clancarty, dated February 12, 1818. A postscript contained
this intimation: "It may be proper to mention to you that the French
Government are disposed to go every length in the way of negotiation
with the person mentioned by Lord Kinnaird, or others, to discover the
plot."

Kinnaird absolutely declined to give up the name of his informant, but,
acting on the strength of the postscript, which had been read but not
shown to him, started for Paris with "the great unknown." Some days
after their arrival, and while Kinnaird was a guest of the Duke, the man
was arrested, and discovered to be one Nicholle or Marinet, who had been
appointed _receveur_ under the restored government of Louis XVIII., but
during the _Cent jours_ had fled to Belgium, retaining the funds he had
amassed during his term of office. Kinnaird regarded this action of the
French Government as a breach of faith, and in a "Memorial" to the
French Chamber of Peers, and his _Letter_, maintained that the Duke's
postscript implied a promise of a safe conduct for Marinet to and from
Paris to Brussels. The Duke, on the other hand, was equally positive
(see his letter to Lord Liverpool, May 30, 1818) "that he never intended
to have any negotiations with anybody." Kinnaird was a "dog with a bad
name," He had been accused (see his _Letter to the Earl of Liverpool_,
1816, p. 16) of "the promulgation of dangerous opinions," and of
intimacy "with persons suspected." The Duke speaks of him as "the friend
of Revolutionists"! It is evident that he held the dangerous doctrine
that a promise to a rogue _is_ a promise, and that the authorities took
a different view of the ethics of the situation. It is clear, too, that
the Duke's postscript was ambiguous, but that it did not warrant the
assumption that if Marinet went to Paris he should be protected. The air
was full of plots. The great Duke despised and was inclined to ignore
the pistol or the dagger of the assassin; but he believed that "mischief
was afoot," and that "great personages" might or might not be
responsible. He was beset by difficulties at every turn, and would have
been more than mortal if he had put too favourable a construction on the
scruples, or condoned the imprudence of a "friend of Revolutionists."]

{374}[480] [The reference may be to the Duke of Wellington's intimacy
with Lady Frances Wedderburn Webster. Byron had "passed that way"
himself (see _Letters_, 1898, ii. 251, note i, 323, etc.), and could
hardly attack the Duke on _that_ score.]

150-178, gives a list of twelve favourites, and in this Canto, Don Juan
takes upon himself the characteristics of at least three, Lanskoï,
Zoritch (or Zovitch), and Plato Zoubof. For example (p. 167), "Zoritch
... est le seul étranger qu'elle ait osé créer son favori pendant son
regne. C'étoit un _Servien_ échappé du bagne de Constantinople où il
étoit prisonnier: il parut, pour la première fois, en habit de hussard à
la cour. Il éblouit tout le monde par sa beauté, et les vielles dames en
parlent encore comme d'un Adonis." M. Waliszewski, in his _Romance of an
Empress_ (1894), devotes a chapter to "Private Life and Favouritism"
(ii. 234-286), in which he graphically describes the election and
inauguration of the _Vremienchtchik_, "the man of the moment," paramour
regnant, and consort of the Empress _pro hac vice_: "'We may observe in
Russia a sort of interregnum in affairs, caused by the displacement of
one favourite and the installation of his successor.' ... The
interregnums are, however, of very short duration. Only one lasts for
several months, between the death of Lanskoï (1784) and the succession
of Iermolof.... There is no lack of candidates. The place is good....
Sometimes, too, on the height by the throne, reached at a bound, these
spoilt children of fate grow giddy.... It is over in an instant, at an
evening reception it is noticed that the Empress has gazed attentively
at some obscure lieutenant, presented but just before ... next day it is
reported that he has been appointed aide-de-camp to her Majesty. What
that means is well known. Next day he finds himself in the special suite
of rooms.... The rooms are already vacated, and everything is prepared
for the new-comer. All imaginable comfort and luxury ... await him; and,
on opening a drawer, he finds a hundred thousand roubles [about
£20,000], the usual first gift, a foretaste of Pactolus. That evening,
before the assembled court, the Empress appears, leaning familiarly on
his arm, and on the stroke of ten, as she retires, the new favourite
follows her" (_ibid._, pp. 246-249).]

[508] [After the death or murder of her husband, Peter III., Catherine
Alexievna (1729-1796) (born Sophia Augusta), daughter of the Prince of
Anhalt Zerbst, was solemnly crowned (September, 1762) Empress of all the
Russias.]

{389}[ji] _And almost died for the scarce-fledged Lanskoi_.--[MS.
erased.]

[509] He was the grande passion of the grande Catherine. See her Lives
under the head of "Lanskoi."

[Lanskoi was a youth of as fine and interesting a figure as the
imagination can paint. Of all Catherine's favourites, he was the man
whom she loved the most. In 1784 he was attacked with a fever, and
perished in the arms of her Majesty. When he was no more, Catherine gave
herself up to the most poignant grief, and remained three months without
going out of her palace of Tzarsko-selo. She afterwards raised a superb
monument to his memory. (See _Life of Catherine II._, by W. Tooke, 1800,
iii. 88, 89.)]

[510] [Ten months after the death of Lanskoi, the Empress consoled
herself with Iermolof, described, by Bezborodky, as "a modest refined
young man, who cultivates the society of serious people." In less than a
year this excellent youth is, in turn, displaced by Dmitrief Mamonof.
His _petit nom_ was _Red Coat_, and, for a time, he is a "priceless
creature." "He has," says Catherine, "two superb black eyes, with
eyebrows outlined as one rarely sees; about the middle height, noble in
manner, easy in demeanour." But Mamonof suffered from "scruples of
conscience," and, after a while, with Catherine's consent and blessing,
was happily married to the Princess Shtcherbatof, a maid of honour, and
not, as Byron supposed, a rival "man of the moment."--See _The Story of
a Throne_, by K. Waliszewski, 1895, ii. 135, sq.]

                      I.

    When Newton saw an apple fall, he found
      In that slight startle from his contemplation--
    'T is _said_ (for I'll not answer above ground
      For any sage's creed or calculation)--
    A mode of proving that the Earth turned round
      In a most natural whirl, called "gravitation;"
    And this is the sole mortal who could grapple,[jt]
    Since Adam--with a fall--or with an apple.[ju][525]

                      II.

    Man fell with apples, and with apples rose,
      If this be true; for we must deem the mode
    In which Sir Isaac Newton could disclose
      Through the then unpaved stars the turnpike road,[jv]
    A thing to counterbalance human woes:[526]
      For ever since immortal man hath glowed
    With all kinds of mechanics, and full soon
    Steam-engines will conduct him to the moon.

                      III.

    And wherefore this exordium?--Why, just now,
      In taking up this paltry sheet of paper,
    My bosom underwent a glorious glow,
      And my internal spirit cut a caper:
    And though so much inferior, as I know,
      To those who, by the dint of glass and vapour,
    Discover stars, and sail in the wind's eye,
    I wish to do as much by Poesy.

                      IV.

    In the wind's eye I have sailed, and sail; but for
      The stars, I own my telescope is dim;
    But at the least I have shunned the common shore,
      And leaving land far out of sight, would skim
    The Ocean of Eternity:[527] the roar
      Of breakers has not daunted my slight, trim,
    But _still_ sea-worthy skiff; and she may float
    Where ships have foundered, as doth many a boat.

                      V.

    We left our hero, Juan, in the _bloom_
      Of favouritism, but not yet in the _blush;--_
    And far be it from my _Muses_ to presume
      (For I have more than one Muse at a push),
    To follow him beyond the drawing-room:
      It is enough that Fortune found him flush
    Of Youth, and Vigour, Beauty, and those things
    Which for an instant clip Enjoyment's wings.

                      VI.

    But soon they grow again and leave their nest.
      "Oh!" saith the Psalmist, "that I had a dove's
    Pinions to flee away, and be at rest!"
      And who that recollects young years and loves,--
    Though hoary now, and with a withering breast,
      And palsied Fancy, which no longer roves
    Beyond its dimmed eye's sphere,--but would much rather
    Sigh like his son, than cough like his grandfather?

                      VII.

    But sighs subside, and tears (even widows') shrink,
      Like Arno[528] in the summer, to a shallow,
    So narrow as to shame their wintry brink,
      Which threatens inundations deep and yellow!
    Such difference doth a few months make. You'd think
      Grief a rich field which never would lie fallow;
    No more it doth--its ploughs but change their boys,
    Who furrow some new soil to sow for joys.

                      VIII.

    But coughs will come when sighs depart--and now
      And then before sighs cease; for oft the one
    Will bring the other, ere the lake-like brow
      Is ruffled by a wrinkle, or the Sun
    Of Life reached ten o'clock: and while a glow,
      Hectic and brief as summer's day nigh done,
    O'erspreads the cheek which seems too pure for clay,
    Thousands blaze, love, hope, die,--how happy they!--

                      IX.

    But Juan was not meant to die so soon:--
      We left him in the focus of such glory
    As may be won by favour of the moon
      Or ladies' fancies--rather transitory
    Perhaps; but who would scorn the month of June,
      Because December, with his breath so hoary,
    Must come? Much rather should he court the ray,
    To hoard up warmth against a wintry day.

                      X.

    Besides, he had some qualities which fix
      Middle-aged ladies even more than young:
    The former know what's what; while new-fledged chicks
      Know little more of Love than what is sung
    In rhymes, or dreamt (for Fancy will play tricks)
      In visions of those skies from whence Love sprung.
    Some reckon women by their suns or years,
    I rather think the Moon should date the dears.

                      XI.

    And why? because she's changeable and chaste:
      I know no other reason, whatsoe'er
    Suspicious people, who find fault in haste,[jw]
      May choose to tax me with; which is not fair,
    Nor flattering to "their temper or their taste,"
      As my friend Jeffrey writes with such an air:[529]
    However, I forgive him, and I trust
    He will forgive himself;--if not, I must.

                      XII.

    Old enemies who have become new friends
      Should so continue--'t is a point of honour;
    And I know nothing which could make amends
      For a return to Hatred: I would shun her
    Like garlic, howsoever she extends
      Her hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her.
    Old flames, new wives, become our bitterest foes--
    Converted foes should scorn to join with those.

                      XIII.

    This were the worst desertion:--renegadoes,
      Even shuffling Southey, that incarnate lie,[jx]
    Would scarcely join again the "reformadoes,"[530]
      Whom he forsook to fill the Laureate's sty;
    And honest men from Iceland to Barbadoes,
      Whether in Caledon or Italy,
    Should not veer round with every breath, nor seize
    To pain, the moment when you cease to please.

                      XIV.

    The lawyer and the critic but behold
      The baser sides of literature and life,
    And nought remains unseen, but much untold,
      By those who scour those double vales of strife.
    While common men grow ignorantly old,
      The lawyer's brief is like the surgeon's knife,
    Dissecting the whole inside of a question,

    A legal broom's a moral chimney-sweeper,

    Retains the sable stains of the dark creeper,
      At least some twenty-nine do out of thirty,
    In all their habits;--not so _you_, I own;
    As Cæsar wore his robe you wear your gown.[533]

      To make such puppets of us things below),
    Are over: Here's a health to "Auld Lang Syne!"
      I do not know you, and may never know
    Your face--but you have acted on the whole
    Most nobly, and I own it from my soul.

                      XVII.

    And when I use the phrase of "Auld Lang Syne!"
      'T is not addressed to you--the more's the pity
    For me, for I would rather take my wine

    But somehow--it may seem a schoolboy's whine,

      Scotch plaids, Scotch snoods, the blue hills, and clear streams,
    The Dee--the Don--Balgounie's brig's _black wall_--[536]
      All my boy feelings, all my gentler dreams
    Of what I _then dreamt_, clothed in their own pall,--
      Like Banquo's offspring--floating past me seems
    My childhood, in this childishness of mine:--
    I care not--'t is a glimpse of "_Auld Lang Syne_."

                      XIX.

    And though, as you remember, in a fit
      Of wrath and rhyme, when juvenile and curly,
    I railed at Scots to show my wrath and wit,
      Which must be owned was sensitive and surly,
    Yet 't is in vain such sallies to permit,
      They cannot quench young feelings fresh and early:
    I "_scotched_ not killed" the Scotchman in my blood,
    And love the land of "mountain and of flood."[537]

                      XX.

    Don Juan, who was real, or ideal,--
      For both are much the same, since what men think
    Exists when the once thinkers are less real
      Than what they thought, for Mind can never sink,
    And 'gainst the Body makes a strong appeal;
      And yet 't is very puzzling on the brink
    Of what is called Eternity to stare,
    And know no more of what is _here_, than _there_;--

                      XXI.

    Don Juan grew a very polished Russian--
      _How_ we won't mention, _why_ we need not say:
    Few youthful minds can stand the strong concussion
      Of any slight temptation in their way;
    But _his_ just now were spread as is a cushion
      Smoothed for a Monarch's seat of honour: gay
    Damsels, and dances, revels, ready money,
    Made ice seem Paradise, and winter sunny.

                      XXII.

    The favour of the Empress was agreeable;
      And though the duty waxed a little hard,
    Young people at his time of life should be able
      To come off handsomely in that regard.
    He was now growing up like a green tree, able
      For Love, War, or Ambition, which reward
    Their luckier votaries, till old Age's tedium
    Make some prefer the circulating medium.

                      XXIII.

    About this time, as might have been anticipated,
      Seduced by Youth and dangerous examples,
    Don Juan grew, I fear, a little dissipated;
      Which is a sad thing, and not only tramples
    On our fresh feelings, but--as being participated
      With all kinds of incorrigible samples
    Of frail humanity--must make us selfish,
    And shut our souls up in us like a shell-fish.

                      XXIV.

    This we pass over. We will also pass
      The usual progress of intrigues between
    Unequal matches, such as are, alas!
      A young Lieutenant's with a _not old_ Queen,
    But one who is not so youthful as she was
      In all the royalty of sweet seventeen.[jy]
    Sovereigns may sway materials, but not matter,
    And wrinkles, the d----d democrats! won't flatter.

                      XXV.

    And Death, the Sovereign's Sovereign, though the great
      Gracchus of all mortality, who levels,
    With his _Agrarian_ laws,[538] the high estate
      Of him who feasts, and fights, and roars, and revels,
    To one small grass-grown patch (which must await
      Corruption for its crop) with the poor devils
    Who never had a foot of land till now,--
    Death's a reformer--all men must allow.

                      XXVI.

    He lived (not Death, but Juan) in a hurry
      Of waste, and haste, and glare, and gloss, and glitter,
    In this gay clime of bear-skins black and furry--
      Which (though I hate to say a thing that's bitter)
    Peep out sometimes, when things are in a flurry,
      Through all the "purple and fine linen," fitter
    For Babylon's than Russia's royal harlot--
    And neutralise her outward show of scarlet.

                      XXVII.

    And this same state we won't describe: we would
      Perhaps from hearsay, or from recollection:
    But getting nigh grim Dante's "obscure wood,"[539]
      That horrid equinox, that hateful section
    Of human years--that half-way house--that rude
      Hut, whence wise travellers drive with circumspection[jz]
    Life's sad post-horses o'er the dreary frontier
    Of Age, and looking back to Youth, give _one_ tear;--

                      XXVIII.

    I won't describe,--that is, if I can help
      Description; and I won't reflect,--that is,
    If I can stave off thought, which--as a whelp
      Clings to its teat--sticks to me through the abyss
    Of this odd labyrinth; or as the kelp
      Holds by the rock; or as a lover's kiss
    Drains its first draught of lips:--but, as I said,
    I _won't_ philosophise, and _will_ be read.

                      XXIX.

    Juan, instead of courting courts, was courted,--
      A thing which happens rarely: this he owed
    Much to his youth, and much to his reported
      Valour; much also to the blood he showed,
    Like a race-horse; much to each dress he sported,
      Which set the beauty off in which he glowed,
    As purple clouds befringe the sun; but most
    He owed to an old woman and his post.

                      XXX.

    He wrote to Spain;--and all his near relations,
      Perceiving he was in a handsome way
    Of getting on himself, and finding stations
      For cousins also, answered the same day.
    Several prepared themselves for emigrations;
      And eating ices, were o'erheard to say,
    That with the addition of a slight pelisse,
    Madrid's and Moscow's climes were of a piece.

                      XXXI.

    His mother, Donna Inez, finding, too,
      That in the lieu of drawing on his banker,
    Where his assets were waxing rather few,
      He had brought his spending to a handsome anchor,--
    Replied, "that she was glad to see him through
      Those pleasures after which wild youth will hanker;
    As the sole sign of Man's being in his senses
    Is--learning to reduce his past expenses.[ka]

                      XXXII.

    "She also recommended him to God,
      And no less to God's Son, as well as Mother,
    Warned him against Greek worship, which looks odd
      In Catholic eyes; but told him, too, to smother
    _Outward_ dislike, which don't look well abroad;
      Informed him that he had a little brother
    Born in a second wedlock; and above
    All, praised the Empress's _maternal_ love.

                      XXXIII.

    "She could not too much give her approbation
      Unto an Empress, who preferred young men
    Whose age, and what was better still, whose nation
      And climate, stopped all scandal (now and then);--
    At home it might have given her some vexation;
      But where thermometers sink down to ten,
    Or five, or one, or zero, she could never
    Believe that Virtue thawed before the river."[kb]

                      XXXIV.

    Oh for a _forty-parson power_[540]--to chant
      Thy praise, Hypocrisy! Oh for a hymn
    Loud as the virtues thou dost loudly vaunt,
      Not practise! Oh for trump of Cherubim!
    Or the ear-trumpet of my good old aunt,[541]
      Who, though her spectacles at last grew dim,
    Drew quiet consolation through its hint,
    When she no more could read the pious print.

                      XXXV.

    She was no Hypocrite at least, poor soul,
      But went to heaven in as sincere a way
    As anybody on the elected roll,
      Which portions out upon the Judgment Day
    Heaven's freeholds, in a sort of Doomsday scroll,
      Such as the conqueror William did repay
    His knights with, lotting others' properties
    Into some sixty thousand new knights' fees.

                      XXXVI.

    I can't complain, whose ancestors are there,
      Erneis, Radulphus--eight-and-forty manors
    (If that my memory doth not greatly err)
      Were _their_ reward for following Billy's banners:[542]
    And though I can't help thinking 't was scarce fair
      To strip the Saxons of their _hydes_[543] like tanners;
    Yet as they founded churches with the produce,
    You'll deem, no doubt, they put it to a good use.[kc]

                      XXXVII.

    The gentle Juan flourished, though at times
      He felt like other plants called sensitive,
    Which shrink from touch, as Monarchs do from rhymes,
      Save such as Southey can afford to give.
    Perhaps he longed in bitter frosts for climes
      In which the Neva's ice would cease to live
    Before May-day: perhaps, despite his duty,
    In Royalty's vast arms he sighed for Beauty:

                      XXXVIII.

    Perhaps--but, sans perhaps, we need not seek[kd]
      For causes young or old: the canker-worm
    Will feed upon the fairest, freshest cheek,
      As well as further drain the withered form:
    Care, like a housekeeper, brings every week
      His bills in, and however we may storm,
    They must be paid: though six days smoothly run,
    The seventh will bring blue devils or a dun.

                      XXXIX.

    I don't know how it was, but he grew sick:
      The Empress was alarmed, and her physician
    (The same who physicked Peter) found the tick
      Of his fierce pulse betoken a condition
    Which augured of the dead, however _quick_
      Itself, and showed a feverish disposition;
    At which the whole Court was extremely troubled,
    The Sovereign shocked, and all his medicines doubled.

                      XL.

    Low were the whispers, manifold the rumours:
      Some said he had been poisoned by Potemkin;
    Others talked learnedly of certain tumours,
      Exhaustion, or disorders of the same kin;[544]
    Some said 't was a concoction of the humours,
      Which with the blood too readily will claim kin:
    Others again were ready to maintain,
    "'T was only the fatigue of last campaign."

                      XLI.

    But here is one prescription out of many:
      "_Sodae sulphat_. ʒvj. ʒfs. _Mannae optim._
    _Aq. fervent._ f. ℥ ifs. ʒij. _tinct. Sennae_
      _Haustus_" (And here the surgeon came and cupped him)
    "℞ _Pulv. Com._ gr. iij. _Ipecacuanhæ_"
      (With more beside if Juan had not stopped 'em).
    "_Bolus Potassae Sulphuret. sumendus_,
    _Et haustus ter in die capiendus._"

                      XLII.

    This is the way physicians mend or end us,
      _Secundum artem_: but although we sneer
    In health--when ill, we call them to attend us,
      Without the least propensity to jeer;
    While that "_hiatus maxime deflendus_"
      To be filled up by spade or mattock's near,
    Instead of gliding graciously down Lethe,
    We tease mild Baillie,[545] or soft Abernethy.

                      XLIII.

    Juan demurred at this first notice to
      Quit; and though Death had threatened an ejection,
    His youth and constitution bore him through,
      And sent the doctors in a new direction.
    But still his state was delicate: the hue
      Of health but flickered with a faint reflection
    Along his wasted cheek, and seemed to gravel
    The faculty--who said that he must travel.

                      XLIV.

    The climate was too cold, they said, for him,
      Meridian-born, to bloom in. This opinion
    Made the chaste Catherine look a little grim,
      Who did not like at first to lose her minion:
    But when she saw his dazzling eye wax dim,
      And drooping like an eagle's with clipt pinion,
    She then resolved to send him on a mission,
    But in a style becoming his condition.

                      XLV.

    There was just then a kind of a discussion,
      A sort of treaty or negotiation,
    Between the British cabinet and Russian,
      Maintained with all the due prevarication
    With which great states such things are apt to push on;
      Something about the Baltic's navigation,
    Hides, train-oil, tallow, and the rights of Thetis,
    Which Britons deem their _uti possidetis_.

                      XLVI.

    So Catherine, who had a handsome way
      Of fitting out her favourites, conferred
    This secret charge on Juan, to display
      At once her royal splendour, and reward
    His services. He kissed hands the next day,
      Received instructions how to play his card,
    Was laden with all kinds of gifts and honours,
    Which showed what great discernment was the donor's.

                      XLVII.

    But she was lucky, and luck's all. Your Queens
      Are generally prosperous in reigning--
    Which puzzles us to know what Fortune means:--
      But to continue--though her years were waning,
    Her climacteric teased her like her teens;
      And though her dignity brooked no complaining,
    So much did Juan's setting off distress her,
    She could not find at first a fit successor.

                      XLVIII.

    But Time, the comforter, will come at last;
      And four-and-twenty hours, and twice that number
    Of candidates requesting to be placed,
      Made Catherine taste next night a quiet slumber:--
    Not that she meant to fix again in haste,
      Nor did she find the quantity encumber,
    But always choosing with deliberation,
    Kept the place open for their emulation.

                      XLIX.

    While this high post of honour's in abeyance,
      For one or two days, reader, we request
    You'll mount with our young hero the conveyance
      Which wafted him from Petersburgh: the best
    Barouche, which had the glory to display once
      The fair Czarina's autocratic crest,
    When, a new Iphigene, she went to Tauris,
    Was given to her favourite,[546] and now _bore his_.

                      L.

    A bull-dog, and a bullfinch, and an ermine,
      All private favourites of Don Juan;--for
    (Let deeper sages the true cause determine)
      He had a kind of inclination, or
    Weakness, for what most people deem mere vermin,
      Live animals: an old maid of threescore
    For cats and birds more penchant ne'er displayed,
    Although he was not old, nor even a maid;--

                      LI.

    The animals aforesaid occupied
      Their station: there were valets, secretaries,
    In other vehicles; but at his side
      Sat little Leila, who survived the parries
    He made 'gainst Cossacque sabres in the wide
      Slaughter of Ismail. Though my wild Muse varies
    Her note, she don't forget the infant girl
    Whom he preserved, a pure and living pearl.

                      LII.

    Poor little thing! She was as fair as docile,
      And with that gentle, serious character,
    As rare in living beings as a fossile
      Man, 'midst thy mouldy mammoths, "grand Cuvier!"[ke]
    Ill fitted was her ignorance to jostle
      With this o'erwhelming world, where all must err:
    But she was yet but ten years old, and therefore
    Was tranquil, though she knew not why or wherefore.

                      LIII.

    Don Juan loved her, and she loved him, as
      Nor brother, father, sister, daughter love.--I
    cannot tell exactly what it was;
      He was not yet quite old enough to prove
    Parental feelings, and the other class,
      Called brotherly affection, could not move
    His bosom,--for he never had a sister:
    Ah! if he had--how much he would have missed her!

                      LIV.

    And still less was it sensual; for besides
      That he was not an ancient debauchee,
    (Who like sour fruit, to stir their veins' salt tides,
      As acids rouse a dormant alkali,)[kf]
    Although (_'t will_ happen as our planet guides)
      His youth was not the chastest that might be,
    There was the purest Platonism at bottom
    Of all his feelings--only he forgot 'em.

                      LV.

    Just now there was no peril of temptation;
      He loved the infant orphan he had saved,
    As patriots (now and then) may love a nation;
      His pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved
    Owing to him;--as also her salvation
      Through his means and the Church's might be paved.
    But one thing's odd, which here must be inserted,
    The little Turk refused to be converted.

                      LVI.

    'T was strange enough she should retain the impression
      Through such a scene of change, and dread, and slaughter;
    But though three Bishops told her the transgression,
      She showed a great dislike to holy water;
    She also had no passion for confession;
      Perhaps she had nothing to confess:--no matter,
    Whate'er the cause, the Church made little of it--
    She still held out that Mahomet was a prophet.

                      LVII.

    In fact, the only Christian she could bear
      Was Juan; whom she seemed to have selected
    In place of what her home and friends once _were_.
      _He_ naturally loved what he protected:
    And thus they formed a rather curious pair,
      A guardian green in years, a ward connected
    In neither clime, time, blood, with her defender;
    And yet this want of ties made theirs more tender.

                      LVIII.

    They journeyed on through Poland and through Warsaw,
      Famous for mines of salt and yokes of iron:
    Through Courland also, which that famous farce saw
      Which gave her dukes the graceless name of "Biron."[547]
    'T is the same landscape which the modern Mars saw,
      Who marched to Moscow, led by Fame, the Siren!
    To lose by one month's frost some twenty years
    Of conquest, and his guard of Grenadiers.

                      LIX.

    Let this not seem an anti-climax:--"Oh!
      My guard! my old guard!"[548] exclaimed that god of clay.
    Think of the Thunderer's falling down below
      Carotid-artery-cutting Castlereagh![kg]
    Alas! that glory should be chilled by snow!
      But should we wish to warm us on our way
    Through Poland, there is Kosciusko's name
    Might scatter fire through ice, like Hecla's flame.

                      LX.

    From Poland they came on through Prussia Proper,
      And Königsberg, the capital, whose vaunt,
    Besides some veins of iron, lead, or copper,
      Has lately been the great Professor Kant.[549]
    Juan, who cared not a tobacco-stopper
      About philosophy, pursued his jaunt
    To Germany, whose somewhat tardy millions
    Have princes who spur more than their postilions.

                      LXI.

    And thence through Berlin, Dresden, and the like,
      Until he reached the castellated Rhine:--
    Ye glorious Gothic scenes! how much ye strike
      All phantasies, not even excepting mine!
    A grey wall, a green ruin, rusty pike,
      Make my soul pass the equinoctial line
    Between the present and past worlds, and hover
    Upon their airy confines, half-seas-over.

                      LXII.

    But Juan posted on through Mannheim, Bonn,
      Which Drachenfels[550] frowns over like a spectre
    Of the good feudal times for ever gone,
      On which I have not time just now to lecture.
    From thence he was drawn onwards to Cologne,
      A city which presents to the inspector
    Eleven thousand maiden heads of bone.
    The greatest number flesh hath ever known.[551]

                      LXIII.

    From thence to Holland's Hague and Helvoetsluys,
      That water-land of Dutchmen and of ditches,
    Where juniper expresses its best juice,
      The poor man's sparkling substitute for riches.
    Senates and sages have condemned its use--
      But to deny the mob a cordial, which is
    Too often all the clothing, meat, or fuel,
    Good government has left them, seems but cruel.

                      LXIV.

    Here he embarked, and with a flowing sail
      Went bounding for the Island of the free,
    Towards which the impatient wind blew half a gale;
      High dashed the spray, the bows dipped in the sea,
    And sea-sick passengers turned somewhat pale;
      But Juan, seasoned, as he well might be,
    By former voyages, stood to watch the skiffs
    Which passed, or catch the first glimpse of the cliffs.

                      LXV.

    At length they rose, like a white wall along
      The blue sea's border; and Don Juan felt--
    What even young strangers feel a little strong
      At the first sight of Albion's chalky belt--A
    kind of pride that he should be among
      Those haughty shopkeepers, who sternly dealt
    Their goods and edicts out from pole to pole,
    And made the very billows pay them toll.

                      LXVI.

    I've no great cause to love that spot of earth,
      Which holds what _might have been_ the noblest nation;
    But though I owe it little but my birth,
      I feel a mixed regret and veneration
    For its decaying fame and former worth.
      Seven years (the usual term of transportation)
    Of absence lay one's old resentments level,
    When a man's country's going to the devil.

                      LXVII.

    Alas! could she but fully, truly, know
      How her great name is now throughout abhorred;
    How eager all the Earth is for the blow
      Which shall lay bare her bosom to the sword;
    How all the nations deem her their worst foe,
      That worse than _worst of foes_, the once adored
    False friend, who held out Freedom to Mankind,
    And now would chain them--to the very _mind_;--

                      LXVIII.

    Would she be proud, or boast herself the free,
      Who is but first of slaves? The nations are
    In prison,--but the gaoler, what is he?
      No less a victim to the bolt and bar.
    Is the poor privilege to turn the key
      Upon the captive, Freedom? He's as far
    From the enjoyment of the earth and air
    Who watches o'er the chain, as they who wear.

                      LXIX.

    Don Juan now saw Albion's earliest beauties,
      Thy cliffs, _dear_ Dover! harbour, and hotel;
    Thy custom-house, with all its delicate duties;
      Thy waiters running mucks at every bell;
    Thy packets, all whose passengers are booties
      To those who upon land or water dwell;
    And last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,
    Thy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted.

                      LXX.

      And rich in rubles, diamonds, cash, and credit,
    Who did not limit much his bills per week,
      Yet stared at this a little, though he paid it,--
    (His Maggior Duomo, a smart, subtle Greek,
      Before him summed the awful scroll and read it):
    But, doubtless, as the air--though seldom sunny--
    Is free, the respiration's worth the money.

                      LXXI.

    On with the horses! Off to Canterbury!
      Tramp, tramp o'er pebble, and splash, splash through puddle;
    Hurrah! how swiftly speeds the post so merry!
      Not like slow Germany, wherein they muddle
    Along the road,[552] as if they went to bury
      Their fare; and also pause besides, to fuddle
    With "schnapps"--sad dogs! whom "Hundsfot," or "Verflucter,"[553]
    Affect no more than lightning a conductor.[kh]

                      LXXII.

    Now there is nothing gives a man such spirits,
      Leavening his blood as cayenne doth a curry,
    As going at full speed--no matter where its
      Direction be, so 't is but in a hurry,
    And merely for the sake of its own merits;
      For the less cause there is for all this flurry,
