    The greater is the pleasure in arriving
    At the great _end_ of travel--which is driving.

                      LXXIII.

    They saw at Canterbury the cathedral;
      Black Edward's helm, and Becket's bloody stone,
    Were pointed out as usual by the bedral,
      In the same quaint, uninterested tone:--
    There's glory again for you, gentle reader! All
      Ends in a rusty casque and dubious bone,[554]
    Half-solved into these sodas or magnesias,
    Which form that bitter draught, the human species.

                      LXXIV.

    The effect on Juan was of course sublime:
      He breathed a thousand Cressys, as he saw
    That casque, which never stooped except to Time.
      Even the bold Churchman's tomb excited awe,
    Who died in the then great attempt to climb
      O'er Kings, who _now_ at least _must talk_ of Law
    Before they butcher. Little Leila gazed,
    And asked why such a structure had been raised:

                      LXXV.

    And being told it was "God's House," she said
      He was well lodged, but only wondered how
    He suffered Infidels in his homestead,
      The cruel Nazarenes, who had laid low
    His holy temples in the lands which bred
      The True Believers;--and her infant brow
    Was bent with grief that Mahomet should resign
    A mosque so noble, flung like pearls to swine.

                      LXXVI.

    On! on! through meadows, managed like a garden,
      A paradise of hops and high production;
    For, after years of travel by a bard in
      Countries of greater heat, but lesser suction,
    A green field is a sight which makes him pardon
      The absence of that more sublime construction,
    Which mixes up vines--olives--precipices--
    Glaciers--volcanoes--oranges and ices.

                      LXXVII.

    And when I think upon a pot of beer----
      But I won't weep!--and so drive on, postilions!
    As the smart boys spurred fast in their career,
      Juan admired these highways of free millions--
    A country in all senses the most dear
      To foreigner or native, save some silly ones,
    Who "kick against the pricks" just at this juncture,
    And for their pains get only a fresh puncture.[ki]

                      LXXVIII.

    What a delightful thing's a turnpike road!
      So smooth, so level, such a mode of shaving
    The Earth, as scarce the eagle in the broad
      Air can accomplish, with his wide wings waving.
    Had such been cut in Phaeton's time, the god
      Had told his son to satisfy his craving
    With the York mail;--but onward as we roll,
    _Surgit amari aliquid_--the toll![555]

                      LXXIX.

    Alas! how deeply painful is all payment!
      Take lives--take wives--take aught except men's purses:
    As Machiavel shows those in purple raiment,
      Such is the shortest way to general curses.[556]
    They hate a murderer much less than a claimant
      On that sweet ore which everybody nurses.--
    Kill a man's family, and he may brook it,
    But keep your hands out of his breeches' pocket:

                      LXXX.

    So said the Florentine: ye monarchs, hearken
      To your instructor. Juan now was borne,
    Just as the day began to wane and darken,
      O'er the high hill, which looks with pride or scorn
    Toward the great city.--Ye who have a spark in
      Your veins of Cockney spirit, smile or mourn
    According as you take things well or ill;--
    Bold Britons, we are now on Shooter's Hill!

                      LXXXI.

    The Sun went down, the smoke rose up, as from
      A half-unquenched volcano, o'er a space
    Which well beseemed the "Devil's drawing-room,"
      As some have qualified that wondrous place:
    But Juan felt, though not approaching _Home_,
      As one who, though he were not of the race,
    Revered the soil, of those true sons the mother,
    Who butchered half the earth, and bullied t' other.[557]

                      LXXXII.

    A mighty mass of brick, and smoke, and shipping,
      Dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye
    Could reach, with here and there a sail just skipping
      In sight, then lost amidst the forestry
    Of masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping
      On tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy;
    A huge, dun Cupola, like a foolscap crown
    On a fool's head--and there is London Town!

                      LXXXIII.

    But Juan saw not this: each wreath of smoke
      Appeared to him but as the magic vapour
    Of some alchymic furnace, from whence broke
      The wealth of worlds (a wealth of tax and paper):
    The gloomy clouds, which o'er it as a yoke
      Are bowed, and put the Sun out like a taper,
    Were nothing but the natural atmosphere,
    Extremely wholesome, though but rarely clear.

                      LXXXIV.

    He paused--and so will I; as doth a crew
      Before they give their broadside. By and by,
    My gentle countrymen, we will renew
      Our old acquaintance; and at least I'll try
    To tell you truths _you_ will not take as true,
      Because they are so;--a male Mrs. Fry,[558]
    With a soft besom will I sweep your halls,
    And brush a web or two from off the walls.

                      LXXXV.

    Oh Mrs. Fry! Why go to Newgate? Why
      Preach to _poor_ rogues? And wherefore not begin
    With Carlton, or with other houses? Try
      Your hand at hardened and imperial Sin.
    To mend the People's an absurdity,
      A jargon, a mere philanthropic din,
    Unless you make their betters better:--Fie!
    I thought you had more religion, Mrs. Fry.

                      LXXXVI.

    Teach _them_ the decencies of good threescore;
      Cure _them_ of tours, hussar and highland dresses;
    Tell _them_ that youth once gone returns no more,
      That hired huzzas redeem no land's distresses;
    Tell them Sir William Curtis[559] is a bore,
      Too dull even for the dullest of excesses--
    The witless Falstaff of a hoary Hal,
    A fool whose bells have ceased to ring at all.

                      LXXXVII.

    Tell them, though it may be, perhaps, too late--
      On Life's worn confine, jaded, bloated, sated--
    To set up vain pretence of being _great_,
      'T is not so to be _good_; and, be it stated,
    The worthiest kings have ever loved least state:
      And tell them--But you won't, and I have prated
    Just now enough; but, by and by, I'll prattle
    Like Roland's horn[560] in Roncesvalles' battle.[kj][561]

[541] [In a letter to his sister, October 25, 1804 (_Letters_, 1898, i.
40), Byron mentions an aunt--"the amiable antiquated Sophia," and asks,
"Is she yet in the land of the living, or does she sing psalms with the
Blessed in the other world?" This was his father's sister, Sophia Maria,
daughter of Admiral the Hon. John Byron. But his "good old aunt" is,
more probably, the Hon. Mrs. Frances Byron, widow of George (born April
22, 1730) son of the fourth, and brother of the "Wicked" lord. She was
the daughter and co-heiress of Ellis Levett, Esq., and lived "at
Nottingham in her own house." She died, aged 86, June 13, 1822, not long
before this Canto was written. She is described in the obituary notice
of the _Gentleman's Magazine_, June, 1822, vol. 92, p. 573, as "Daughter
of Vice-Admiral the Hon. John Byron (who sailed round the world with
Lord Anson), grandfather of the present Lord Byron." But that is,
chronologically, impossible. Byron must have retained a pleasing
recollection of the ear-trumpet and the spectacles, and it gratified his
kindlier humour to embalm their owner in his verse.]

[542] [See Collins's _Peerage_, 1779, vii. 120. It is probable that
Byron was lineally descended from Ralph de Burun, of Horestan, who is

Notts and five in Derbyshire, but with regard to Ernysius or Erneis the

[545] [Matthew Baillie (1761-1823), the nephew of William Hunter, the
brother of Agnes and Joanna Baillie, was a celebrated anatomist. He
attended Byron (1799-1802), when an endeavour was made to effect a cure
of the muscular contraction of his right leg and foot. He was consulted
by Lady Byron, in 1816, with regard to her husband's supposed
derangement, but was not admitted when he called at the house in
Piccadilly. He is said to have "avoided technical and learned phrases;
to have affected no sentimental tenderness, but expressed what he had to
say in the simplest and plainest terms" (_Annual Biography_, 1824, p.
319). Jekyll (_Letters_, 1894, p. 110) repeats or invents an anecdote
that "the old king, in his mad fits, used to say he could bring any dead
people to converse with him, except those who had died under Baillie's
care, for that the doctor always dissected them into so many morsels,
that they had not a leg to walk to Windsor with." It is hardly necessary
to say that John Abernethy (1764-1831) "expressed what _he_ had to say"
in the bluntest and rudest terms at his disposal.]

have crossed during many days vast, solitary regions, from which her
Majesty has driven Zaporogua, Budjak, and Nogais Tartars, who, ten years
ago, threatened to ravage her empire. All these places were furnished
with magnificent tents for breakfasts, lunches, dinners, suppers, and
sleeping-rooms ... deserted regions were at once transformed into
fields, groves, villages: ... The Empress has left in each chief town
gifts to the value of a hundred thousand roubles. Every day that we
remained stationary was marked with diamonds, balls, fireworks, and
illuminations throughout a circuit of ten leagues." --_The Prince de

{417}[547] In the Empress Anne's time, Biren, her favourite, assumed the
name and arms of the "Birons" of France; which families are yet extant
with that of England. There are still the daughters of Courland of that
name; one of them I remember seeing in England in the blessed year of
the Allies (1814)--the Duchess of S.--to whom the English Duchess of
Somerset presented me as a namesake.

["Ernest John Biren was born in Courland [in 1690]. His grandfather had
been head groom to James, the third Duke of Courland, and obtained from
his master the present of a small estate in land.... In 1714 he made his
appearance at St. Petersburg, and solicited the place of page to the
Princess Charlotte, wife of the Tzarovitch Alexey; but being
contemptuously rejected as a person of mean extraction, retired to
Mittau, where he chanced to ingratiate himself with Count Bestuchef,
Master of the Household to Anne, widow of Frederic William, Duke of
Courland, who resided at Mittau. Being of a handsome figure and polite
address, he soon gained the good will of the duchess, and became her
secretary and chief favourite. On her being declared sovereign of
Russia, Anne called Biren to Petersburg, and the secretary soon became
Duke of Courland, and first minister or rather despot of Russia. On the
death of Anne, which happened in 1740, Biren, being declared regent,
continued daily increasing his vexations and cruelties, till he was
arrested, on the 18th of December, only twenty days after he had been
appointed to the regency; and at the revolution that ensued he was
exiled to the frozen shores of the Oby." _Catherine II._, by W. Tooke,
1800, i. 160, _footnote_. He was recalled in 1763, and died in 1772.

In a letter to his sister, dated June 18, 1814, Byron gives a slightly
different version of the incident, recorded in his note (_vide supra_):
"The Duchess of Somerset also, to mend matters, insisted on presenting
me to a Princess _Biron_, Duchess of Hohen-God-knows-what, and another
person to her two sisters, Birons too. But I flew off, and _would_ not,
saying I had had enough of introductions for that night at
least."--_Letters_, 1899, iii. 98. The "daughters of Courland" must have
been descendants of "Pierre, dernier Duc de Courlande, De la Maison de
Biron," viz. Jeanne Cathérine, born June 24, 1783, who married, in 1801,
François Pignatelli de Belmonte, Duc d'Acerenza, and Dorothée, born
August 21, 1793, who married, in 1809, Edmond de Talleyrand Périgord,
Duc de Talleyrand, nephew to the Bishop of Autun. (See _Almanach de

                 CANTO THE ELEVENTH.


                      I.

    WHEN Bishop Berkeley said "there was no matter,"[562]
      And proved it--'t was no matter what he said:
    They say his system 't is in vain to batter,
      Too subtle for the airiest human head;
    And yet who can believe it? I would shatter
      Gladly all matters down to stone or lead,
    Or adamant, to find the World a spirit,
    And wear my head, denying that I wear it.

                      II.

    What a sublime discovery 't was to make the
      Universe universal egotism,
    That all's ideal--_all ourselves!_--I'll stake the
      World (be it what you will) that _that's_ no schism.
    Oh Doubt!--if thou be'st Doubt, for which some take thee,
      But which I doubt extremely--thou sole prism
    Of the Truth's rays, spoil not my draught of spirit!
    Heaven's brandy, though our brain can hardly bear it.

                      III.

    For ever and anon comes Indigestion
      (Not the most "dainty Ariel"),[563] and perplexes
    Our soarings with another sort of question:
      And that which after all my spirit vexes,
    Is, that I find no spot where Man can rest eye on,
      Without confusion of the sorts and sexes,
    Of Beings, Stars, and this unriddled wonder,
    The World, which at the worst's a _glorious_ blunder--

                      IV.

    If it be chance--or, if it be according
      To the old text, still better:--lest it should
    Turn out so, we 'll say nothing 'gainst the wording,
      As several people think such hazards rude.
    They're right; our days are too brief for affording
      Space to dispute what _no one_ ever could
    Decide, and _everybody one day_ will
    Know very clearly--or at least lie still.

                      V.

    And therefore will I leave off metaphysical
      Discussion, which is neither here nor there:
    If I agree that what is, is; then this I call
      Being quite perspicuous and extremely fair;
    The truth is, I've grown lately rather phthisical:[564]
      I don't know what the reason is--the air
    Perhaps; but as I suffer from the shocks
    Of illness, I grow much more orthodox.

                      VI.

    The first attack at once proved the Divinity
      (But that I never doubted, nor the Devil);
    The next, the Virgin's mystical virginity;
      The third, the usual Origin of Evil;
    The fourth at once established the whole Trinity
      On so uncontrovertible a level,
    That I devoutly wished the three were four--
    On purpose to believe so much the more.

                      VII.

    To our theme.--The man who has stood on the Acropolis,
      And looked down over Attica; or he
    Who has sailed where picturesque Constantinople is,
      Or seen Timbuctoo, or hath taken tea
    In small-eyed China's crockery-ware metropolis,
      Or sat amidst the bricks of Nineveh,[kk]
    May not think much of London's first appearance--
    But ask him what he thinks of it a year hence!

                      VIII.

    Don Juan had got out on Shooter's Hill;
      Sunset the time, the place the same declivity
    Which looks along that vale of Good and Ill
      Where London streets ferment in full activity,
    While everything around was calm and still,
      Except the creak of wheels, which on their pivot he
    Heard,--and that bee-like, bubbling, busy hum
    Of cities, that boil over with their scum:--

                      IX.

    I say, Don Juan, wrapped in contemplation,
      Walked on behind his carriage, o'er the summit,
    And lost in wonder of so great a nation,
      Gave way to 't, since he could not overcome it.
    "And here," he cried, "is Freedom's chosen station;
      Here peals the People's voice, nor can entomb it
    Racks--prisons--inquisitions; Resurrection
    Awaits it, each new meeting or election.

                      X.

    "Here are chaste wives, pure lives; here people pay
      But what they please; and if that things be dear,
    'T is only that they love to throw away
      Their cash, to show how much they have a-year.
    Here laws are all inviolate--none lay
      Traps for the traveller--every highway's clear--
    Here"--he was interrupted by a knife,
    With--"Damn your eyes! your money or your life!"--

                      XI.

    These free-born sounds proceeded from four pads
      In ambush laid, who had perceived him loiter
    Behind his carriage; and, like handy lads,
      Had seized the lucky hour to reconnoitre,
    In which the heedless gentleman who gads
      Upon the road, unless he prove a fighter,
    May find himself within that isle of riches
    Exposed to lose his life as well as breeches.

                      XII.

    Juan, who did not understand a word
      Of English, save their shibboleth, "God damn!"[565]
    And even that he had so rarely heard,
      He sometimes thought 't was only their "Salām,"
    Or "God be with you!"--and 't is not absurd
      To think so,--for half English as I am
    (To my misfortune), never can I say
    I heard them wish "God with you," save that way;--

                      XIII.

    Juan yet quickly understood their gesture,
      And being somewhat choleric and sudden,
    Drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture,
      And fired it into one assailant's pudding--
    Who fell, as rolls an ox o'er in his pasture,
      And roared out, as he writhed his native mud in,
    Unto his nearest follower or henchman,
    "Oh Jack! I'm floored by that 'ere bloody Frenchman!"

                      XIV.

    On which Jack and his train set off at speed,
      And Juan's suite, late scattered at a distance,
    Came up, all marvelling at such a deed,
      And offering, as usual, late assistance.
    Juan, who saw the moon's late minion[566] bleed
      As if his veins would pour out his existence,
    Stood calling out for bandages and lint,
    And wished he had been less hasty with his flint.

                      XV.

    "Perhaps," thought he, "it is the country's wont
      To welcome foreigners in this way: now
    I recollect some innkeepers who don't
      Differ, except in robbing with a bow,
    In lieu of a bare blade and brazen front--
      But what is to be done? I can't allow
    The fellow to lie groaning on the road:
    So take him up--I'll help you with the load."

                      XVI.

    But ere they could perform this pious duty,
      The dying man cried, "Hold! I've got my gruel!
    Oh! for a glass of _max_![567] We've missed our booty;
      Let me die where I am!" And as the fuel
    Of Life shrunk in his heart, and thick and sooty
      The drops fell from his death-wound, and he drew ill
    His breath,--he from his swelling throat untied
    A kerchief, crying, "Give Sal that!"--and died.

                      XVII.

    The cravat stained with bloody drops fell down
      Before Don Juan's feet: he could not tell
    Exactly why it was before him thrown,
      Nor what the meaning of the man's farewell.
    Poor Tom was once a kiddy upon town,
      A thorough varmint, and a _real_ swell,
    Full flash,[568] all fancy, until fairly diddled,
    His pockets first and then his body riddled.

                      XVIII.

    Don Juan, having done the best he could
      In all the circumstances of the case,
    As soon as "Crowner's quest"[569] allowed, pursued
      His travels to the capital apace;--
    Esteeming it a little hard he should
      In twelve hours' time, and very little space,
    Have been obliged to slay a free-born native
    In self-defence: this made him meditative.

                      XIX.

    He from the world had cut off a great man,
      Who in his time had made heroic bustle.
    Who in a row like Tom could lead the van,
      Booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle?
    Who queer a flat?[570] Who (spite of Bow-street's ban)
      On the high toby-spice so flash the muzzle?
    Who on a lark with black-eyed Sal (his blowing),
    So prime--so swell--so nutty--and so knowing?[kl][571]

                      XX.

    But Tom's no more--and so no more of Tom.
      Heroes must die; and by God's blessing 't is
    Not long before the most of them go home.
      Hail! Thamis, hail! Upon thy verge it is
    That Juan's chariot, rolling like a drum
      In thunder, holds the way it can't well miss,
    Through Kennington and all the other "tons,"
    Which make us wish ourselves in town at once;--

                      XXI.

    Through Groves, so called as being void of trees,
      (Like _lucus_ from _no_ light); through prospects named
    Mount Pleasant, as containing nought to please,
      Nor much to climb; through little boxes framed
    Of bricks, to let the dust in at your ease,
      With "To be let," upon their doors proclaimed;
    Through "Rows" most modestly called "Paradise,"[572]
    Which Eve might quit without much sacrifice;--[km]

                      XXII.

    Through coaches, drays, choked turnpikes, and a whirl
      Of wheels, and roar of voices, and confusion;
    Here taverns wooing to a pint of "purl,"[573]
      There mails fast flying off like a delusion;
    There barbers' blocks with periwigs in curl
      In windows; here the lamplighter's infusion
    Slowly distilled into the glimmering glass
    (For in those days we had not got to gas--);[kn][574]

                      XXIII.

    Through this, and much, and more, is the approach
      Of travellers to mighty Babylon:
    Whether they come by horse, or chaise, or coach,
      With slight exceptions, all the ways seem one.
    I could say more, but do not choose to encroach
      Upon the Guide-book's privilege. The Sun
    Had set some time, and night was on the ridge
    Of twilight, as the party crossed the bridge.

                      XXIV.

    That's rather fine, the gentle sound of Thamis--
      Who vindicates a moment, too, his stream--
    Though hardly heard through multifarious "damme's:"
      The lamps of Westminster's more regular gleam,
    The breadth of pavement, and yon shrine where Fame is
      A spectral resident--whose pallid beam
    In shape of moonshine hovers o'er the pile--
    Make this a sacred part of Albion's isle.

                      XXV.

    The Druids' groves are gone--so much the better:
      Stonehenge is not--but what the devil is it?--But
    Bedlam still exists with its sage fetter,
      That madmen may not bite you on a visit;
    The Bench too seats or suits full many a debtor;
      The Mansion House,[575] too (though some people quiz it),
    To me appears a stiff yet grand erection;
    But then the Abbey's worth the whole collection.

                      XXVI.

    The line of lights,[576] too, up to Charing Cross,
      Pall Mall, and so forth, have a coruscation
    Like gold as in comparison to dross,
      Matched with the Continent's illumination,
    Whose cities Night by no means deigns to gloss.
      The French were not yet a lamp-lighting nation,
    And when they grew so--on their new-found lantern,
    Instead of wicks, they made a wicked man turn.[577]

                      XXVII.

    A row of Gentlemen along the streets
      Suspended may illuminate mankind,
    As also bonfires made of country seats;
      But the old way is best for the purblind:
    The other looks like phosphorus on sheets,
      A sort of _ignis fatuus_ to the mind,
    Which, though 't is certain to perplex and frighten,
    Must burn more mildly ere it can enlighten.

                      XXVIII.

    But London's so well lit, that if Diogenes
      Could recommence to hunt his _honest man_,
    And found him not amidst the various progenies
      Of this enormous City's spreading span,
    'T were not for want of lamps to aid his dodging his
      Yet undiscovered treasure. What _I_ can,
    I've done to find the same throughout Life's journey,
    But see the World is only one attorney.

                      XXIX.

    Over the stones still rattling, up Pall Mall,
      Through crowds and carriages, but waxing thinner
    As thundered knockers broke the long sealed spell
      Of doors 'gainst duns, and to an early dinner
    Admitted a small party as night fell,--
      Don Juan, our young diplomatic sinner,
    Pursued his path, and drove past some hotels,
    St. James's Palace, and St. James's "Hells."[578]

                      XXX.

    They reached the hotel: forth streamed from the front door[ko]
      A tide of well-clad waiters, and around
    The mob stood, and as usual several score
      Of those pedestrian Paphians who abound
    In decent London when the daylight's o'er;
      Commodious but immoral, they are found
    Useful, like Malthus, in promoting marriage.--
    But Juan now is stepping from his carriage

                      XXXI.

    Into one of the sweetest of hotels,[kp][579]
      Especially for foreigners--and mostly
    For those whom favour or whom Fortune swells,
      And cannot find a bill's small items costly.
    There many an envoy either dwelt or dwells
      (The den of many a diplomatic lost lie),
    Until to some conspicuous square they pass,
    And blazon o'er the door their names in brass.

                      XXXII.

    Juan, whose was a delicate commission,
      Private, though publicly important, bore
    No title to point out with due precision
      The exact affair on which he was sent o'er.
    'T was merely known, that on a secret mission
      A foreigner of rank had graced our shore,
    Young, handsome, and accomplished, who was said
    (In whispers) to have turned his Sovereign's head.

                      XXXIII.

    Some rumour also of some strange adventures
      Had gone before him, and his wars and loves;
    And as romantic heads are pretty painters,
      And, above all, an Englishwoman's roves[kq]
    Into the excursive, breaking the indentures
      Of sober reason, wheresoe'er it moves,
    He found himself extremely in the fashion,
    Which serves our thinking people for a passion.

                      XXXIV.

    I don't mean that they are passionless, but quite
      The contrary; but then 't is in the head;
    Yet as the consequences are as bright
      As if they acted with the heart instead,
    What after all can signify the site
      Of ladies' lucubrations? So they lead
    In safety to the place for which you start,
    What matters if the road be head or heart?

                      XXXV.

    Juan presented in the proper place,
      To proper placemen, every Russ credential;
    And was received with all the due grimace
      By those who govern in the mood potential,
    Who, seeing a handsome stripling with smooth face,
      Thought (what in state affairs is most essential),
    That they as easily might _do_ the youngster,
    As hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster.

                      XXXVI.

    They erred, as agéd men will do; but by
      And by we'll talk of that; and if we don't,
    'T will be because our notion is not high
      Of politicians and their double front,
    Who live by lies, yet dare not boldly lie:--
      Now what I love in women is, they won't
    Or can't do otherwise than lie--but do it
    So well, the very Truth seems falsehood to it.

                      XXXVII.

    And, after all, what is a lie? 'T is but
      The truth in masquerade; and I defy[kr]
    Historians--heroes--lawyers--priests, to put
      A fact without some leaven of a lie.
    The very shadow of true Truth would shut
      Up annals--revelations--poesy,
    And prophecy--except it should be dated
    Some years before the incidents related.

                      XXXVIII.

    Praised be all liars and all lies! Who now
      Can tax my mild Muse with misanthropy?
    She rings the World's "Te Deum," and her brow
      Blushes for those who will not:--but to sigh
    Is idle; let us like most others bow,
      Kiss hands--feet--any part of Majesty,
    After the good example of "Green Erin,"[580]
    Whose shamrock now seems rather worse for wearing.[ks]

                      XXXIX.

    Don Juan was presented, and his dress
      And mien excited general admiration--
    I don't know which was more admired or less:
      One monstrous diamond drew much observation,
    Which Catherine in a moment of _"ivresse"_
      (In Love or Brandy's fervent fermentation),
    Bestowed upon him, as the public learned;
    And, to say truth, it had been fairly earned.

                      XL.

    Besides the ministers and underlings,
      Who must be courteous to the accredited
    Diplomatists of rather wavering Kings,
      Until their royal riddle's fully read,
    The very clerks,--those somewhat dirty springs
      Of Office, or the House of Office, fed
    By foul corruption into streams,--even they
    Were hardly rude enough to earn their pay:

                      XLI.

    And insolence no doubt is what they are
      Employed for, since it is their daily labour,
    In the dear offices of Peace or War;
      And should you doubt, pray ask of your next neighbour,
    When for a passport, or some other bar
      To freedom, he applied (a grief and a bore),
    If he found not this spawn of tax-born riches,
    Like lap-dogs, the least civil sons of b-----s.

                      XLII.

    But Juan was received with much _"empressement:"_--
      These phrases of refinement I must borrow
    From our next neighbours' land, where, like a chessman,
      There is a move set down for joy or sorrow,
    Not only in mere talking, but the press. Man
      In Islands is, it seems, downright and thorough,
    More than on Continents--as if the Sea
    (See Billingsgate) made even the tongue more free.

                      XLIII.

    And yet the British "Damme"'s rather Attic,
      Your continental oaths are but incontinent,
    And turn on things which no aristocratic
      Spirit would name, and therefore even I won't anent[581]
    This subject quote; as it would be schismatic
      In _politesse_, and have a sound affronting in 't;--
    But "Damme"'s quite ethereal, though too daring--
    Platonic blasphemy--the soul of swearing.[kt]

                      XLIV.

    For downright rudeness, ye may stay at home;
      For true or false politeness (and scarce _that
    Now_) you may cross the blue deep and white foam--
      The first the emblem (rarely though) of what
    You leave behind, the next of much you come
      To meet. However, 't is no time to chat
    On general topics: poems must confine
    Themselves to unity, like this of mine.[ku]

                      XLV.

    In the great world,--which, being interpreted,
      Meaneth the West or worst end of a city,
    And about twice two thousand people bred
      By no means to be very wise or witty,
    But to sit up while others lie in bed,
      And look down on the Universe with pity,--
    Juan, as an inveterate patrician,
    Was well received by persons of condition.

                      XLVI.

    He was a bachelor, which is a matter
      Of import both to virgin and to bride,
    The former's hymeneal hopes to flatter;
      And (should she not hold fast by Love or Pride)
    'T is also of some moment to the latter:
      A rib's a thorn in a wed gallant's side,
    Requires decorum, and is apt to double
    The horrid sin--and what's still worse, the trouble.

                      XLVII.

    But Juan was a bachelor--of arts,
      And parts, and hearts: he danced and sung, and had
    An air as sentimental as Mozart's
      Softest of melodies; and could be sad
    Or cheerful, without any "flaws or starts,"[582]
      Just at the proper time: and though a lad,
    Had seen the world--which is a curious sight,
    And very much unlike what people write.

                      XLVIII.

    Fair virgins blushed upon him; wedded dames
      Bloomed also in less transitory hues;[kv]
    For both commodities dwell by the Thames,
      The painting and the painted; Youth, Ceruse,[kw]
    Against his heart preferred their usual claims,
      Such as no gentleman can quite refuse:
    Daughters admired his dress, and pious mothers
    Inquired his income, and if he had brothers.

                      XLIX.

    The milliners who furnish "drapery Misses"[583]
      Throughout the season, upon speculation
    Of payment ere the Honeymoon's last kisses
      Have waned into a crescent's coruscation,
    Thought such an opportunity as this is,
      Of a rich foreigner's initiation,
    Not to be overlooked--and gave such credit,
    That future bridegrooms swore, and sighed, and paid it.

                      L.

    The Blues, that tender tribe, who sigh o'er sonnets,
      And with the pages of the last Review
    Line the interior of their heads or bonnets,
      Advanced in all their azure's highest hue:
    They talked bad French or Spanish, and upon its
      Late authors asked him for a hint or two;
    And which was softest, Russian or Castilian?
    And whether in his travels he saw Ilion?

                      LI.

    Juan, who was a little superficial,
      And not in literature a great Drawcansir,[584]
    Examined by this learnéd and especial
      Jury of matrons, scarce knew what to answer:
    His duties warlike, loving or official,
      His steady application as a dancer,
    Had kept him from the brink of Hippocrene,
    Which now he found was blue instead of green.

                      LII.

    However, he replied at hazard, with
      A modest confidence and calm assurance,
    Which lent his learnéd lucubrations pith,
      And passed for arguments of good endurance.
    That prodigy, Miss Araminta Smith
      (Who at sixteen translated "Hercules Furens"
    Into as furious English), with her best look,
    Set down his sayings in her common-place book.

                      LIII.

    Juan knew several languages--as well
      He might--and brought them up with skill, in time
    To save his fame with each accomplished belle,
      Who still regretted that he did not rhyme.
    There wanted but this requisite to swell
      His qualities (with them) into sublime:
    Lady Fitz-Frisky, and Miss Maevia Mannish,
    Both longed extremely to be sung in Spanish.

                      LIV.

    However, he did pretty well, and was
      Admitted as an aspirant to all
    The coteries, and, as in Banquo's glass,
      At great assemblies or in parties small,
    He saw ten thousand living authors pass,
      That being about their average numeral;
    Also the eighty "greatest living poets,"[585]
    As every paltry magazine can show _it's_.

                      LV.

    In twice five years the "greatest living poet,"
      Like to the champion in the fisty ring,
    Is called on to support his claim, or show it,
      Although 't is an imaginary thing.
    Even I--albeit I'm sure I did not know it,
      Nor sought of foolscap subjects to be king,--
    Was reckoned, a considerable time,
    The grand Napoleon of the realms of rhyme.[kx]

                      LVI.

    But Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero
      My Leipsic, and my Mont Saint Jean seems Cain:[586]
    _La Belle Alliance_ of dunces down at zero,
      Now that the Lion's fallen, may rise again:
    But I will fall at least as fell my Hero;
      Nor reign at all, or as a _monarch_ reign;
    Or to some lonely isle of gaolers go,
    With turncoat Southey for my turnkey Lowe.[ky]

                      LVII.

    Sir Walter reigned before me; Moore and Campbell
      Before and after; but now grown more holy,
    The Muses upon Sion's hill must ramble
      With poets almost clergymen, or wholly;
    And Pegasus has a psalmodic amble
      Beneath the very Reverend Rowley Powley,[kz][587]
    Who shoes the glorious animal with stilts,
    A modern Ancient Pistol--"by these hilts!"[588]

                      LVIII.

    Still he excels that artificial hard
      Labourer in the same vineyard, though the vine
    Yields him but vinegar for his reward.--
      That neutralised dull Dorus of the Nine;
    That swarthy Sporus, neither man nor bard;
      That ox of verse, who _ploughs_ for every line:--
    Cambyses' roaring Romans beat at least
    The howling Hebrews of Cybele's priest.--[589]

                      LIX.

    Then there's my gentle Euphues,--who, they say,[la]
      Sets up for being a sort of _moral me_;[590]
    He'll find it rather difficult some day
      To turn out both, or either, it may be.
    Some persons think that Coleridge hath the sway;
      And Wordsworth has supporters, two or three;
    And that deep-mouthed Boeotian "Savage Landor"[591]
    Has taken for a swan rogue Southey's gander.

                      LX.

    John Keats, who was killed off by one critique,
      Just as he really promised something great,
    If not intelligible, without Greek
      Contrived to talk about the gods of late,
    Much as they might have been supposed to speak.[592]
      Poor fellow! His was an untoward fate;
    'T is strange the mind, that very fiery particle,[lb][593]
    Should let itself be snuffed out by an article.

                      LXI.

    The list grows long of live and dead pretenders
      To that which none will gain--or none will know
    The conqueror at least; who, ere Time renders
      His last award, will have the long grass grow
    Above his burnt-out brain, and sapless cinders.
      If I might augur, I should rate but low
    Their chances;--they're too numerous, like the thirty[594]
    Mock tyrants, when Rome's annals waxed but dirty.

                      LXII.

    This is the literary _lower_ empire,
      Where the praetorian bands take up the matter;--
    A "dreadful trade," like his who "gathers samphire,"[595]
      The insolent soldiery to soothe and flatter,
    With the same feelings as you'd coax a vampire.
      Now, were I once at home, and in good satire,
    I'd try conclusions with those Janizaries,
    And show them _what_ an intellectual war is.

                      LXIII.

    I think I know a trick or two, would turn
      Their flanks;--but it is hardly worth my while,
    With such small gear to give myself concern:
      Indeed I've not the necessary bile;
    My natural temper's really aught but stern,
      And even my Muse's worst reproof's a smile;
    And then she drops a brief and modern curtsy,
    And glides away, assured she never hurts ye.

                      LXIV.

    My Juan, whom I left in deadly peril
      Amongst live poets and _blue_ ladies, passed
    With some small profit through that field so sterile,
      Being tired in time--and, neither least nor last,
    Left it before he had been treated very ill;
      And henceforth found himself more gaily classed
    Amongst the higher spirits of the day,
    The Sun's true son, no vapour, but a ray.

                      LXV.

    His morns he passed in business--which dissected,
      Was, like all business, a laborious nothing
    That leads to lassitude, the most infected
      And Centaur Nessus garb of mortal clothing,[596]
    And on our sofas makes us lie dejected,
      And talk in tender horrors of our loathing
    All kinds of toil, save for our country's good--
    Which grows no better, though 't is time it should.

                      LXVI.

    His afternoons he passed in visits, luncheons,
      Lounging and boxing; and the twilight hour
    In riding round those vegetable puncheons
      Called "Parks," where there is neither fruit nor flower
    Enough to gratify a bee's slight munchings;
      But after all it is the only "bower"[597]
    (In Moore's phrase) where the fashionable fair
    Can form a slight acquaintance with fresh air.

                      LXVII.

    Then dress, then dinner, then awakes the world!
      Then glare the lamps, then whirl the wheels, then roar
    Through street and square fast flashing chariots hurled
      Like harnessed meteors; then along the floor
    Chalk mimics painting; then festoons are twirled;
      Then roll the brazen thunders of the door,
    Which opens to the thousand happy few
    An earthly Paradise of _Or Molu_.

                      LXVIII.

    There stands the noble hostess, nor shall sink
      With the three-thousandth curtsy; there the waltz,
    The only dance which teaches girls to think,[598]
      Makes one in love even with its very faults.
    Saloon, room, hall, o'erflow beyond their brink,
      And long the latest of arrivals halts,
    'Midst royal dukes and dames condemned to climb,
    And gain an inch of staircase at a time.

                      LXIX.

    Thrice happy he who, after a survey
      Of the good company, can win a corner,
    A door that's _in_ or boudoir _out_ of the way,
      Where he may fix himself like small "Jack Horner,"
    And let the Babel round run as it may,
      And look on as a mourner, or a scorner,
    Or an approver, or a mere spectator,
    Yawning a little as the night grows later.

                      LXX.

    But this won't do, save by and by; and he
      Who, like Don Juan, takes an active share,
    Must steer with care through all that glittering sea
      Of gems and plumes and pearls and silks, to where
    He deems it is his proper place to be;
      Dissolving in the waltz to some soft air,
    Or proudlier prancing with mercurial skill,
    Where Science marshals forth her own quadrille.

                      LXXI.

    Or, if he dance not, but hath higher views
      Upon an heiress or his neighbour's bride,
    Let him take care that that which he pursues
      Is not at once too palpably descried:
    Full many an eager gentleman oft rues
      His haste; Impatience is a blundering guide
    Amongst a people famous for reflection,
    Who like to play the fool with circumspection.

                      LXXII.

    But, if you can contrive, get next at supper;
      Or, if forestalled, get opposite and ogle:--
    Oh, ye ambrosial moments! always upper
      In mind, a sort of sentimental bogle,[599]
    Which sits for ever upon Memory's crupper,
      The ghost of vanished pleasures once in vogue! Ill
    Can tender souls relate the rise and fall
    Of hopes and fears which shake a single ball.

                      LXXIII.

    But these precautionary hints can touch
      Only the common run, who must pursue,
    And watch and ward; whose plans a word too much
      Or little overturns; and not the few
    Or many (for the number's sometimes such)
      Whom a good mien, especially if new,
    Or fame--or name--for Wit, War, Sense, or Nonsense,
    Permits whate'er they please,--or _did_ not long since.

                      LXXIV.

    Our Hero--as a hero--young and handsome,
      Noble, rich, celebrated, and a stranger,
    Like other slaves of course must pay his ransom,
      Before he can escape from so much danger
    As will environ a conspicuous man. Some
      Talk about poetry, and "rack and manger,"
    And ugliness, disease, as toil and trouble;--
    I wish they knew the life of a young noble.

                      LXXV.

    They are young, but know not Youth--it is anticipated;
     Handsome but wasted, rich without a sou;[lc]
    Their vigour in a thousand arms is dissipated;
      Their cash comes _from_, their wealth goes _to_ a Jew;
    Both senates see their nightly votes participated
      Between the Tyrant's and the Tribunes' crew;
    And having voted, dined, drunk, gamed, and whored,
    The family vault receives another Lord.

                      LXXVI.

    "Where is the World?" cries Young, at _eighty_[600]--"Where
      The World in which a man was born?" Alas!
    Where is the world of _eight_ years past? _'T was there_--
      I look for it--'t is gone, a globe of glass!
    Cracked, shivered, vanished, scarcely gazed on, ere[ld]
      A silent change dissolves the glittering mass.
    Statesmen, Chiefs, Orators, Queens, Patriots, Kings,
    And Dandies--all are gone on the Wind's wings.

                      LXXVII.

    Where is Napoleon the Grand? God knows!
      Where little Castlereagh? The devil can tell!
    Where Grattan, Curran, Sheridan--all those
      Who bound the Bar or Senate in their spell?
    Where is the unhappy Queen, with all her woes?
      And where the Daughter, whom the Isles loved well?
    Where are those martyred saints the Five per Cents?[le][601]
    And where--oh, where the devil are the Rents?

                      LXXVIII.

    Where's Brummell? Dished. Where's Long Pole Wellesley?[602] Diddled.
      Where's Whitbread? Romilly? Where's George the Third?
    Where is his will?[603] (That's not so soon unriddled.)
      And where is "Fum" the Fourth, our "royal bird?"[604]
    Gone down, it seems, to Scotland to be fiddled
      Unto by Sawney's violin, we have heard:
    "Caw me, caw thee"--for six months hath been hatching
    This scene of royal itch and loyal scratching.

                      LXXIX.

    Where is Lord This? And where my Lady That?
      The Honourable Mistresses and Misses?
    Some laid aside like an old Opera hat,
      Married, unmarried, and remarried: (this is
    An evolution oft performed of late).
      Where are the Dublin shouts--and London hisses?
    Where are the Grenvilles? Turned as usual. Where
    My friends the Whigs? Exactly where they were.

                      LXXX.

    Where are the Lady Carolines and Franceses?[605]
      Divorced or doing thereanent. Ye annals
    So brilliant, where the list of routs and dances is,--
      Thou Morning Post, sole record of the panels
    Broken in carriages, and all the phantasies
      Of fashion,--say what streams now fill those channels?
    Some die, some fly, some languish on the Continent,
    Because the times have hardly left them _one_ tenant.

                      LXXXI.

    Some who once set their caps at cautious dukes,[lf]
      Have taken up at length with younger brothers:
    Some heiresses have bit at sharpers' hooks:
      Some maids have been made wives, some merely mothers:
    Others have lost their fresh and fairy looks:
      In short, the list of alterations bothers.
    There's little strange in this, but something strange is
    The unusual quickness of these common changes.

                      LXXXII.

    Talk not of seventy years as age; in seven
      I have seen more changes, down from monarchs to
    The humblest individuals under Heaven,
      Than might suffice a moderate century through.
    I knew that nought was lasting, but now even
      Change grows too changeable, without being new:
    Nought's permanent among the human race,
    Except the Whigs _not_ getting into place.

                      LXXXIII.

    I have seen Napoleon, who seemed quite a Jupiter,
      Shrink to a Saturn. I have seen a Duke
    (No matter which) turn politician stupider,
      If that can well be, than his wooden look.
    But it is time that I should hoist my "blue Peter,"
      And sail for a new theme:--I have seen--and shook
    To see it--the King hissed, and then caressed;
    But don't pretend to settle which was best.

                      LXXXIV.

    I have seen the Landholders without a rap--
      I have seen Joanna Southcote--I have seen
    The House of Commons turned to a tax-trap--
      I have seen that sad affair of the late Queen--
    I have seen crowns worn instead of a fool's cap--
      I have seen a Congress[606] doing all that's mean--
    I have seen some nations, like o'erloaded asses,
    Kick off their burthens--meaning the high classes.

                      LXXXV.

    I have seen small poets, and great prosers, and
      Interminable--_not eternal_--speakers--
    I have seen the funds at war with house and land--
      I have seen the country gentlemen turn squeakers--
    I have seen the people ridden o'er like sand
      By slaves on horseback--I have seen malt liquors
    Exchanged for "thin potations"[607] by John Bull--
    I have seen John half detect himself a fool.--

                      LXXXVI.

    But _"carpe diem,"_ Juan, _"carpe, carpe!"_[608]
      To-morrow sees another race as gay
    And transient, and devoured by the same harpy.
      "Life's a poor player,"[609]--then "play out the play,[610]
    Ye villains!" and above all keep a sharp eye
      Much less on what you do than what you say:
    Be hypocritical, be cautious, be
    Not what you _seem_, but always what you _see_.

                      LXXXVII.

    But how shall I relate in other cantos
      Of what befell our hero in the land,
    Which 't is the common cry and lie to vaunt as
      A moral country? But I hold my hand--
    For I disdain to write an Atalantis;[611]
      But 't is as well at once to understand,
    You are _not_ a moral people, and you know it,
    Without the aid of too sincere a poet.

                      LXXXVIII.

    What Juan saw and underwent shall be
      My topic, with of course the due restriction
    Which is required by proper courtesy;
      And recollect the work is only fiction,
    And that I sing of neither mine nor me,
      Though every scribe, in some slight turn of diction,
    Will hint allusions never _meant_. Ne'er doubt
    _This_--when I speak, I _don't hint_, but _speak out_.

                      LXXXIX.

    Whether he married with the third or fourth
      Offspring of some sage husband-hunting countess,
    Or whether with some virgin of more worth
      (I mean in Fortune's matrimonial bounties),
    He took to regularly peopling Earth,
      Of which your lawful, awful wedlock fount is,--
    Or whether he was taken in for damages,
    For being too excursive in his homages,--

                      XC.

    Is yet within the unread events of Time.
      Thus far, go forth, thou Lay, which I will back
    Against the same given quantity of rhyme,
      For being as much the subject of attack
    As ever yet was any work sublime,
      By those who love to say that white is black.
    So much the better!--I may stand alone,
    But would not change my free thoughts for a throne.[612]

{427}[562] [Berkeley did not deny the reality of existence, but the
reality of matter as an abstract conception. "It is plain," he says (_On
the Principles of Human Knowledge_, sect. ix.), "that the very notion of
what is called _matter_ or _corporeal substance_, involves a
contradiction in it." Again, "It were a mistake to think that what is
here said derogates in the least from the reality of things." His
contention was that this _reality_ depended, not on an abstraction
_called_ matter, "an inert, extended unperceiving substance," but on
"those unextended, indivisible substances or _spirits_, which act, and
think, and perceive them [unthinking beings]."--_Ibid._, sect. xci.,

    If you at the spellken can't hustle,
      You'll be hobbled in making a clout.
    Then your blowing will wax gallows haughty,
      When she hears of your scaly mistake,
    She'll surely turn snitch for the forty--
      That her Jack may be regular weight."

If there be any gemman so ignorant as to require a traduction, I refer
him to my old friend and corporeal pastor and master, John Jackson,
Esq., Professor of Pugilism; who, I trust, still retains the strength
and symmetry of his model of a form, together with his good humour, and
athletic as well as mental accomplishments.

[Gentleman Jackson was of good renown. "Servility," says Egan (_Life in
London_, 1823, p. 217), "is not known to him. Flattery he detests.
Integrity, impartiality, good-nature, and manliness, are the
corner-stones of his understanding." Byron once said of him that "his
manners were infinitely superior to those of the Fellows of the College
whom I meet at the high table" (J.W. Clark, _Cambridge_, 1890, p. 140).
(See, too, letter to John Jackson, September 18, 1808, _Letters_, 1898,
i. 189, note 2; _Hints from Horace_, line 638, _Poetical Works_, 1898,
i. 433, note 3.) As to the stanza quoted by Egan (_Anecdotes of the
Turf_, 1827, p. 44), but not _traduced_ or interpreted, "To be hobbled
for making a clout" is to be taken into custody for stealing a
handkerchief, to "turn snitch" is to inform, and the "forty" is the £40
offered for the detection of a capital crime, and shared by the police
or Bow Street runners. Dangerous characters were let alone and tacitly
encouraged to continue their career of crime, until the measure of their
iniquity was full, and they "weighed forty." If Jack was clumsy enough
to be detected in a trifling theft, his "blowen" would go over to the
enemy, and betray him for the sake of the Government reward (see
_Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue_, by Francis Grose, 1823,
art. "Weigh forty").]

{433}[572] [Don Juan must have driven by _Pleasant Row_, and passed
within hail of _Paradise Row_, on the way from Kennington to Westminster
Bridge. (See Cary's _New Pocket Plan of London, Westminster, and
Southwark_, 1819.) But, perhaps, there is more in the names of streets
and places than meets the eye. Here, as elsewhere, there is, or there
may be, "a paltering with us in a double sense."]

[576] [Fifty years ago "the lights of Piccadilly" were still regarded as
one of the "sights" of London. Byron must often have looked at them from
his house in Piccadilly Terrace.]

[577] [Joseph François Foulon, army commissioner, provoked the penalty
of the "lantern" (i.e. an improvised gallows on the yard of a lamp-post
at the corner of the Rue de la Vannerie) by his heartless sneer, "Eh
bien! si cette canaille n'a pas de pain, elle mangera du foin." He was
hanged, July 22, 1789. See _The Tale of Two Cities_, by Charles Dickens,
cap. xxii.; see, too, Carlyle's _French Revolution_, 1839, i. 253: "With
wild yells, Sansculottism clutches him, in its hundred hands: he is
whirled ... to the _'Lanterne,'_ ... pleading bitterly for life,--to the
deaf winds. Only with the third rope (for two ropes broke, and the
quavering voice still pleaded), can he be so much as got hanged! His
Body is dragged through the streets; his Head goes aloft on a pike, the
mouth filled with grass: amid sounds as of Tophet, from a grass-eating
people."]

{436}[578] "Hells," gaming-houses. What their number may now be in this
life, I know not. Before I was of age I knew them pretty accurately,
both "gold" and "silver." I was once nearly called out by an
acquaintance, because when he asked me where I thought that his soul
would be found hereafter, I answered, "In Silver Hell."

{442}[583] "Drapery Misses."--This term is probably anything now but a
_mystery_. It was, however, almost so to me when I first returned from
the East in 1811-1812. It means a pretty, a high-born, a fashionable
young female, well instructed by her friends, and furnished by her
milliner with a wardrobe upon credit, to be repaid, when married, by the
_husband_. The riddle was first read to me by a young and pretty
heiress, on my praising the "drapery" of the _"untochered"_ but "pretty
virginities" (like Mrs. Anne Page) of the _then_ day, which has now been
some years yesterday: she assured me that the thing was common in
London; and as her own thousands, and blooming looks, and rich
simplicity of array, put any suspicion in her own case out of the
question, I confess I gave some credit to the allegation. If necessary,
authorities might be cited; in which case I could quote both "drapery"
and the wearers. Let us hope, however, that it is now obsolete.

[587] [The Reverend George Croly, D.D. (1780-1860), began his literary
career as dramatic critic of the _Times_. "Croly," says H.C. Robinson
(_Diary_, 1869, i. 412), "is a fierce-looking Irishman, very lively in
conversation, and certainly has considerable talents as a writer; his
eloquence, like his person, is rather energetic than eloquent" (hence
the epithet "Cambyses," i.e. "King Cambyses' vein" in _var._ iii.). "He
wrote tragedies, comedies, and novels; and, at last, settled down as a
preacher, with the rank of doctor, but of what faculty I do not know"
(ibid., footnote, H.C.R., 1847). He wrote, _inter alia_, _Paris in
1815_, a poem; _Catiline, A Tragedy_, 1822; and _Salathiel_, a novel,
1827. In lines 7, 8, Byron seems to refer to _The Angel of the World, An
Arabian Poem_, published in 1820.]

{445}[589] [Stanza lviii. was first published in 1837. The reference is
to Henry Hart Milman (1791-1868). Byron was under the impression that
Milman had influenced Murray against continuing the publication of _Don
Juan_. Added to this surmise, was the mistaken belief that it was Milman
who had written the article in the _Quarterly_, which "killed John
Keats." Hence the virulence of the attack.

"Dull Dorus" is obscure, but compare Propertius, _Eleg._ III. vii. 44,
where Callimachus is addressed as "Dore poeta." He is the "ox of verse,"
because he had been recently appointed to the Professorship of Poetry at
Oxford. The "roaring Romans" are "The soldiery" who shout "All, All," in
Croly's _Catiline_, act v. sc. 2.]

rima_, with _Don Juan_, favourably and unfavourably: "There is no
profligacy and no horror ... no mocking of virtue and honour, and no
strong mixtures of buffoonery and grandeur." But it may fairly match
with Byron and his Italian models "as to the better qualities of
elegance, delicacy, and tenderness." See, too, _Blackwood's Edinburgh

House to the Duke of Clarence," etc., and as Buckingham House had been
twice sold, and the other legatees were dead, a question arose between
the King and the Duke of York as to the right of inheritance of their
father's personal property. George IV. conceived that it devolved upon
him personally, and not on the Crown, and "consequently appropriated to
himself the whole of the money and the jewels." It is possible that this
difference between the brothers was noised abroad, and that old stories
of the destruction of royal wills were revived to the new king's
discredit. (See _The Greville Memoirs_, 1875, i. 64, 65.)]

    Of all the barbarous middle ages, that
      Which is most barbarous is the middle age
    Of man! it is--I really scarce know what;
      But when we hover between fool and sage,
    And don't know justly what we would be at--
      A period something like a printed page,
    Black letter upon foolscap, while our hair
    Grows grizzled, and we are not what we were;--

                      II.

    Too old for Youth,--too young, at thirty-five,
      To herd with boys, or hoard with good threescore,--
    I wonder people should be left alive;
      But since they are, that epoch is a bore:
    Love lingers still, although 't were late to wive:
      And as for other love, the illusion's o'er;
    And Money, that most pure imagination,
    Gleams only through the dawn of its creation.[613]

                      III.

    O Gold! Why call we misers miserable?[614]
      Theirs is the pleasure that can never pall;
    Theirs is the best bower anchor, the chain cable
      Which holds fast other pleasures great and small.
    Ye who but see the saving man at table,
      And scorn his temperate board, as none at all,
    And wonder how the wealthy can be sparing,
    Know not what visions spring from each cheese-paring.

                      IV.

    Love or lust makes Man sick, and wine much sicker;
      Ambition rends, and gaming gains a loss;
    But making money, slowly first, then quicker,
      And adding still a little through each cross
    (Which _will_ come over things), beats Love or liquor,
      The gamester's counter, or the statesman's _dross_.
    O Gold! I still prefer thee unto paper,

    On 'Change; and even thy silver soil, Peru,
    Must get itself discounted by a Jew.

                      VII.

    Why call the miser miserable? as
      I said before: the frugal life is his,
    Which in a saint or cynic ever was
      The theme of praise: a hermit would not miss
    Canonization for the self-same cause,
      And wherefore blame gaunt Wealth's austerities?
    Because, you 'll say, nought calls for such a trial;--
    Then there's more merit in his self-denial.

                      VIII.

    He is your only poet;--Passion, pure
      And sparkling on from heap to heap, displays,
    _Possessed_, the ore, of which _mere hopes_ allure
      Nations athwart the deep: the golden rays
    Flash up in ingots from the mine obscure:
      On him the Diamond pours its brilliant blaze,
    While the mild Emerald's beam shades down the dies
    Of other stones, to soothe the miser's eyes.

                      IX.

    The lands on either side are his; the ship
      From Ceylon, Inde, or far Cathay, unloads
    For him the fragrant produce of each trip;
      Beneath his cars of Ceres groan the roads,
    And the vine blushes like Aurora's lip;
      His very cellars might be Kings' abodes;
    While he, despising every sensual call,
    Commands--the intellectual Lord of _all_.

                      X.

    Perhaps he hath great projects in his mind,
      To build a college, or to found a race,
    A hospital, a church,--and leave behind
      Some dome surmounted by his meagre face:
    Perhaps he fain would liberate Mankind
      Even with the very ore which makes them base;
    Perhaps he would be wealthiest of his nation,
    Or revel in the joys of calculation.

                      XI.

    But whether all, or each, or none of these
      May be the hoarder's principle of action,
    The fool will call such mania a disease:--
      What is his _own?_ Go--look at each transaction,
    Wars, revels, loves--do these bring men more ease
      Than the mere plodding through each "vulgar fraction?"
    Or do they benefit Mankind? Lean Miser!
    Let spendthrifts' heirs inquire of yours--who's wiser?

                      XII.

    How beauteous are rouleaus! how charming chests
      Containing ingots, bags of dollars, coins
    (Not of old victors, all whose heads and crests
      Weigh not the thin ore where their visage shines,[lg]
    But) of fine unclipped gold, where dully rests
      Some likeness, which the glittering cirque confines,
    Of modern, reigning, sterling, stupid stamp!--
    Yes! ready money _is_ Aladdin's lamp.[619]

                      XIII.

    "Love rules the Camp, the Court, the Grove,--for Love
      Is Heaven, and Heaven is Love:"[620]--so sings the bard;
    Which it were rather difficult to prove
      (A thing with poetry in general hard).
    Perhaps there may be something in "the Grove,"
      At least it rhymes to "Love:" but I'm prepared
    To doubt (no less than landlords of their rental)
    If "Courts" and "Camps" be quite so sentimental.

                      XIV.

    But if Love don't, _Cash_ does, and Cash alone:
      Cash rules the Grove, and fells it too besides;
    Without cash, camps were thin, and courts were none;
      Without cash, Malthus tells you--"take no brides."[621]
    So Cash rules Love the ruler, on his own
      High ground, as virgin Cynthia sways the tides:
    And as for "Heaven being Love," why not say honey
    Is wax? Heaven is not Love, 't is Matrimony.

                      XV.

    Is not all Love prohibited whatever,
      Excepting Marriage? which is Love, no doubt,
    After a sort; but somehow people never
      With the same thought the two words have helped out.
    Love may exist _with_ Marriage, and _should_ ever,
      And Marriage also may exist without;
    But Love _sans_ banns is both a sin and shame,
    And ought to go by quite another name.

                      XVI.

    Now if the "Court," and "Camp," and "Grove," be not
      Recruited all with constant married men,
    Who never coveted their neighbour's lot,
      I say _that_ line's a lapsus of the pen;--
    Strange too in my _buon camerado_ Scott,
      So celebrated for his morals, when
    My Jeffrey held him up as an example[622]
    To me;--of whom these morals are a sample.[lh]

                      XVII.

    Well, if I don't succeed, I _have_ succeeded,
      And that's enough; succeeded in my youth,
    The only time when much success is needed:
      And my success produced what I, in sooth,
    Cared most about; it need not now be pleaded--
      Whate'er it was, 'twas mine; I've paid, in truth,
    Of late, the penalty of such success,
    But have not learned to wish it any less.

                      XVIII.

    That suit in Chancery,[623]--which some persons plead
      In an appeal to the unborn, whom they,
    In the faith of their procreative creed,
      Baptize Posterity, or future clay,--
    To me seems but a dubious kind of reed
      To lean on for support in any way;
    Since odds are that Posterity will know
    No more of them, than they of her, I trow.

                      XIX.[li]

    Why, I'm Posterity--and so are you;
      And whom do we remember? Not a hundred.
    Were every memory written down all true,
      The tenth or twentieth name would be but blundered;
    Even Plutarch's Lives have but picked out a few,
      And 'gainst those few your annalists have thundered;
    And Mitford[624] in the nineteenth century
    Gives, with Greek truth, the good old Greek the lie.

                      XX.

    Good people all, of every degree,
      Ye gentle readers and ungentle writers,
    In this twelfth Canto 't is my wish to be
      As serious as if I had for inditers
    Malthus and Wilberforce:--the last set free
      The Negroes, and is worth a million fighters;
    While Wellington has but enslaved the Whites,
    And Malthus[625] does the thing 'gainst which he writes.

                      XXI.

    I'm serious--so are all men upon paper;
      And why should I not form my speculation,
    And hold up to the Sun my little taper?[626]
      Mankind just now seem wrapped in meditation
    On constitutions and steam-boats of vapour;
      While sages write against all procreation,
    Unless a man can calculate his means
    Of feeding brats the moment his wife weans.

                      XXII.

    That's noble! That's romantic! For my part,
      I think that "Philo-genitiveness" is--
    (Now here's a word quite after my own heart,
      Though there's a shorter a good deal than this,
    If that politeness set it not apart;
      But I'm resolved to say nought that's amiss)--
    I say, methinks that "Philo-genitiveness"[627]
    Might meet from men a little more forgiveness.

                      XXIII.

    And now to business.--O my gentle Juan!
      Thou art in London--in that pleasant place,
    Where every kind of mischief's daily brewing,
      Which can await warm Youth in its wild race.
    'T is true, that thy career is not a new one;
      Thou art no novice in the headlong chase
    Of early life; but this is a new land,
    Which foreigners can never understand.

                      XXIV.

    What with a small diversity of climate,
      Of hot or cold, mercurial or sedate,
    I could send forth my mandate like a Primate
      Upon the rest of Europe's social state;
    But thou art the most difficult to rhyme at,
      Great Britain, which the Muse may penetrate.
    All countries have their "Lions," but in thee
    There is but one superb menagerie.

                      XXV.

    But I am sick of politics. Begin--
      _"Paulo Majora."_ Juan, undecided
    Amongst the paths of being "taken in,"
      Above the ice had like a skater glided:[lj]
    When tired of play, he flirted without sin
      With some of those fair creatures who have prided
    Themselves on innocent tantalisation,[lk]
    And hate all vice except its reputation.

                      XXVI.

    But these are few, and in the end they make
      Some devilish escapade or stir, which shows
    That even the purest people may mistake
      Their way through Virtue's primrose paths of snows;
    And then men stare, as if a new ass spake
      To Balaam, and from tongue to ear o'erflows
    Quicksilver small talk, ending (if you note it)
    With the kind World's Amen--"Who would have thought it?"

                      XXVII.

    The little Leila, with her Orient eyes,
      And taciturn Asiatic disposition,
    (Which saw all Western things with small surprise,
      To the surprise of people of condition,
    Who think that novelties are butterflies
      To be pursued as food for inanition,)
    Her charming figure and romantic history
    Became a kind of fashionable mystery.

                      XXVIII.

    The women much divided--as is usual
      Amongst the sex in little things or great--
    Think not, fair creatures, that I mean to abuse you all,
      I have always liked you better than I state--
    Since I've grown moral, still I must accuse you all
      Of being apt to talk at a great rate;
    And now there was a general sensation
    Amongst you, about Leila's education.

                      XXIX.

    In one point only were you settled--and
      You had reason; 't was that a young child of grace,
    As beautiful as her own native land,
      And far away, the last bud of her race,
    Howe'er our friend Don Juan might command
      Himself for five, four, three, or two years' space,
    Would be much better taught beneath the eye
    Of peeresses whose follies had run dry.

                      XXX.

    So first there was a generous emulation,
      And then there was a general competition,
    To undertake the orphan's education:
      As Juan was a person of condition,
    It had been an affront on this occasion
      To talk of a subscription or petition;
    But sixteen dowagers, ten unwed she sages
    Whose tale belongs to "Hallam's Middle Ages,"[628]

                      XXXI.

    And one or two sad, separate wives, without
      A fruit to bloom upon their withering bough--
    Begged to bring _up_ the little girl, and _"out"_--
      For that's the phrase that settles all things now,
    Meaning a virgin's first blush at a rout,
      And all her points as thorough-bred to show:
    And I assure you, that like virgin honey
    Tastes their first season (mostly if they have money).

                      XXXII.

    How all the needy honourable misters,
      Each out-at-elbow peer, or desperate dandy,
    The watchful mothers, and the careful sisters,
      (Who, by the by, when clever, are more handy
    At making matches, where "'t is gold that glisters,"
      Than their _he_ relatives), like flies o'er candy
    Buzz round "the Fortune" with their busy battery,
    To turn her head with waltzing and with flattery!

                      XXXIII.

    Each aunt, each cousin, hath her speculation;
      Nay, married dames will now and then discover
    Such pure disinterestedness of passion,
      I've known them court an heiress for their lover.
    "_Tantoene!_" Such the virtues of high station,
      Even in the hopeful Isle, whose outlet's "Dover!"
    While the poor rich wretch, object of these cares,
    Has cause to wish her sire had had male heirs.

                      XXXIV.

    Some are soon bagged, and some reject three dozen:
      'T is fine to see them scattering refusals
    And wild dismay o'er every angry cousin
      (Friends of the party), who begin accusals,
    Such as--"Unless Miss Blank meant to have chosen
      Poor Frederick, why did she accord perusals
    To his billets? _Why_ waltz with him? Why, I pray,
    Look _'Yes'_ last night, and yet say _'No'_ to-day?

                      XXXV.

    "Why?--Why?--Besides, Fred really was _attached_;
      'T was not her fortune--he has enough without;
    The time will come she'll wish that she had snatched
      So good an opportunity, no doubt:--
    But the old Marchioness some plan had hatched,
      As I'll tell Aurea at to-morrow's rout:
    And after all poor Frederick may do better--
    Pray did you see her answer to his letter?"

                      XXXVI.

    Smart uniforms and sparkling coronets
      Are spurned in turn, until her turn arrives,
    After male loss of time, and hearts, and bets
      Upon the sweepstakes for substantial wives;
    And when at last the pretty creature gets
      Some gentleman, who fights, or writes, or drives,
    It soothes the awkward squad of the rejected
    To find how very badly she selected.

                      XXXVII.

    For sometimes they accept some long pursuer,
      Worn out with importunity; or fall
    (But here perhaps the instances are fewer)
      To the lot of him who scarce pursued at all.
    A hazy widower turned of forty 's sure[ll][629]
      (If 't is not vain examples to recall)[lm]
    To draw a high prize: now, howe'er he got her, I
    See nought more strange in this than t' other lottery.

                      XXXVIII.

    I, for my part--(one "modern instance" more,
      "True,'t is a pity--pity 't is, 't is true")--[630]
    Was chosen from out an amatory score,
      Albeit my years were less discreet than few;
    But though I also had reformed before
      Those became one who soon were to be two,
    I'll not gainsay the generous public's voice,
    That the young lady made a monstrous choice.

                      XXXIX.

    Oh, pardon my digression--or at least
      Peruse! 'T is always with a moral end
    That I dissert, like grace before a feast:
      For like an agéd aunt, or tiresome friend,
    A rigid guardian, or a zealous priest,
      My Muse by exhortation means to mend
    All people, at all times, and in most places,
    Which puts my Pegasus to these grave paces.

                      XL.

    But now I'm going to be immoral; now
      I mean to show things really as they are,
    Not as they ought to be: for I avow,
      That till we see what's what in fact, we're far
    From much improvement with that virtuous plough
      Which skims the surface, leaving scarce a scar
    Upon the black loam long manured by Vice,
    Only to keep its corn at the old price.

                      XLI.

    But first of little Leila we'll dispose,[ln]
      For like a day-dawn she was young and pure--
    Or like the old comparison of snows,[631]
      (Which are more pure than pleasant, to be sure,
    Like many people everybody knows),--
      Don Juan was delighted to secure
    A goodly guardian for his infant charge,
    Who might not profit much by being at large.

                      XLII.

    Besides, he had found out he was no tutor
      (I wish that others would find out the same),[632]
    And rather wished in such things to stand neuter,
      For silly wards will bring their guardians blame:
    So when he saw each ancient dame a suitor
      To make his little wild Asiatic tame,
    Consulting "the Society for Vice
    Suppression," Lady Pinchbeck was his choice.

                      XLIII.

    Olden she was--but had been very young;
      Virtuous she was--and had been, I believe;
    Although the World has such an evil tongue
      That--but my chaster ear will not receive
    An echo of a syllable that's wrong:[lo]
      In fact, there's nothing makes me so much grieve,
    As that abominable tittle-tattle,
    Which is the cud eschewed[633] by human cattle.

                      XLIV.

    Moreover I've remarked (and I was once
      A slight observer in a modest way),
    And so may every one except a dunce,
      That ladies in their youth a little gay,
    Besides their knowledge of the World, and sense
      Of the sad consequence of going astray,
    Are wiser in their warnings 'gainst the woe
    Which the mere passionless can never know.

                      XLV.

    While the harsh prude indemnifies her virtue
      By railing at the unknown and envied passion,
    Seeking far less to save you than to hurt you,
      Or, what's still worse, to put you out of fashion,--
    The kinder veteran with calm words will court you,
      Entreating you to pause before you dash on;
    Expounding and illustrating the riddle
    Of epic Love's beginning--end--and middle.

                      XLVI.

    Now whether it be thus, or that they are stricter,
      As better knowing why they should be so,
    I think you'll find from many a family picture,
      That daughters of such mothers as may know
    The World by experience rather than by lecture,
      Turn out much better for the Smithfield Show
    Of vestals brought into the marriage mart,
    Than those bred up by prudes without a heart.

                      XLVII.

    I said that Lady Pinchbeck had been talked about--
      As who has not, if female, young, and pretty?
    But now no more the ghost of Scandal stalked about;
      She merely was deemed amiable and witty,
    And several of her best _bons-mots_ were hawked about:
      Then she was given to charity and pity,
    And passed (at least the latter years of life)
    For being a most exemplary wife.

                      XLVIII.

    High in high circles, gentle in her own,
      She was the mild reprover of the young,
    Whenever--which means every day--they'd shown
      An awkward inclination to go wrong.
    The quantity of good she did 's unknown,
      Or at the least would lengthen out my song:
    In brief, the little orphan of the East
    Had raised an interest in her,--which increased.

                      XLIX.

    Juan, too, was a sort of favourite with her,
      Because she thought him a good heart at bottom,
    A little spoiled, but not so altogether;
      Which was a wonder, if you think who got him,
    And how he had been tossed, he scarce knew whither:
      Though this might ruin others, it did _not_ him,
    At least entirely--for he had seen too many
    Changes in Youth, to be surprised at any.

                      L.

    And these vicissitudes tell best in youth;
      For when they happen at a riper age,
    People are apt to blame the Fates, forsooth,
      And wonder Providence is not more sage.
    Adversity is the first path to Truth:
      He who hath proved War--Storm--or Woman's rage,
    Whether his winters be eighteen or eighty,
    Hath won the experience which is deemed so weighty.

                      LI.

    How far it profits is another matter.--
      Our hero gladly saw his little charge
    Safe with a lady, whose last grown-up daughter
      Being long married, and thus set at large,
    Had left all the accomplishments she taught her
      To be transmitted, like the Lord Mayor's barge,
    To the next comer; or--as it will tell
    More Muse-like--like to Cytherea's shell.[lp]

                      LII.

    I call such things transmission; for there is
      A floating balance of accomplishment,
    Which forms a pedigree from Miss to Miss,
      According as their minds or backs are bent.
    Some waltz--some draw--some fathom the abyss
      Of Metaphysics; others are content
    With Music; the most moderate shine as wits;--
    While others have a genius turned for fits.

                      LIII.

    But whether fits, or wits, or harpsichords--
      Theology--fine arts--or finer stays,
    May be the baits for Gentlemen or Lords
      With regular descent, in these our days,
    The last year to the new transfers its hoards;
      New vestals claim men's eyes with the same praise
    Of "elegant" _et cætera_, in fresh batches--
    All matchless creatures--and yet bent on matches.

                      LIV.

    But now I will begin my poem. 'Tis
      Perhaps a little strange, if not quite new,
    That from the first of Cantos up to this
      I've not begun what we have to go through.
    These first twelve books are merely flourishes,
      _Preludios_, trying just a string or two
    Upon my lyre, or making the pegs sure;
    And when so, you shall have the overture.

                      LV.

    My Muses do not care a pinch of rosin
      About what's called success, or not succeeding:
    Such thoughts are quite below the strain they have chosen;
      'T is a "great moral lesson"[634] they are reading.
    I thought, at setting off, about two dozen
      Cantos would do; but at Apollo's pleading,
    If that my Pegasus should not be foundered,
    I think to canter gently through a hundred.

                      LVI.

    Don Juan saw that Microcosm on stilts,
      Yclept the Great World; for it is the least,
    Although the highest: but as swords have hilts
      By which their power of mischief is increased,
    When Man in battle or in quarrel tilts,
      Thus the low world, north, south, or west, or east,
    Must still obey the high[635]--which is their handle,
    Their Moon, their Sun, their gas, their farthing candle.

                      LVII.

    He had many friends who had many wives, and was
      Well looked upon by both, to that extent
    Of friendship which you may accept or pass,
      It does nor good nor harm; being merely meant
    To keep the wheels going of the higher class,
      And draw them nightly when a ticket's sent;
    And what with masquerades, and fêtes, and balls,
    For the first season such a life scarce palls.

                      LVIII.

    A young unmarried man, with a good name
      And fortune, has an awkward part to play;
    For good society is but a game,
      "The royal game of Goose,"[636] as I may say,
    Where everybody has some separate aim,
      An end to answer, or a plan to lay--
    The single ladies wishing to be double,
    The married ones to save the virgins trouble.

                      LIX.

    I don't mean this as general, but particular
      Examples may be found of such pursuits:
    Though several also keep their perpendicular
      Like poplars, with good principles for roots;
    Yet many have a method more _reticular_--
      "Fishers for men," like Sirens with soft lutes:
    For talk six times with the same single lady,
    And you may get the wedding-dresses ready.

                      LX.

    Perhaps you'll have a letter from the mother,
      To say her daughter's feelings are trepanned;
    Perhaps you'll have a visit from the brother,
      All strut, and stays, and whiskers, to demand
    What "your intentions are?"--One way or other
      It seems the virgin's heart expects your hand:
    And between pity for her case and yours,
    You'll add to Matrimony's list of cures.

                      LXI.

    I've known a dozen weddings made even _thus_,
      And some of them high names: I have also known
    Young men who--though they hated to discuss
      Pretensions which they never dreamed to have shown--
    Yet neither frightened by a female fuss,
      Nor by mustachios moved, were let alone,
    And lived, as did the broken-hearted fair,
    In happier plight than if they formed a pair.

                      LXII.

    There's also nightly, to the uninitiated,
      A peril--not indeed like Love or Marriage,
    But not the less for this to be depreciated:
      It is--I meant and mean not to disparage
    The show of Virtue even in the vitiated--
      It adds an outward grace unto their carriage--
    But to denounce the amphibious sort of harlot,
    _Couleur de rose_, who's neither white nor scarlet.

                      LXIII.

    Such is your cold coquette, who can't say "No,"
      And won't say "Yes," and keeps you on and off-ing
    On a lee-shore, till it begins to blow--
      Then sees your heart wrecked, with an inward scoffing.
    This works a world of sentimental woe,[lq]
      And sends new Werters yearly to their coffin;
    But yet is merely innocent flirtation,
    Not quite adultery, but adulteration.

                      LXIV.

    "Ye gods, I grow a talker!"[637] Let us prate.
      The next of perils, though I place it _stern_est,
    Is when, without regard to Church or State,
      A wife makes or takes love in upright earnest.
    Abroad, such things decide few women's fate--
      (Such, early Traveller! is the truth thou learnest)--
    But in old England, when a young bride errs,
    Poor thing! Eve's was a trifling case to hers.

                      LXV.

    For 't is a low, newspaper, humdrum, lawsuit
      Country, where a young couple of the same ages[lr]
    Can't form a friendship, but the world o'erawes it.
      Then there's the vulgar trick of those d----d damages!
    A verdict--grievous foe to those who cause it!--
      Forms a sad climax to romantic homages;
    Besides those soothing speeches of the pleaders,
    And evidences which regale all readers.

                      LXVI.

    But they who blunder thus are raw beginners;
      A little genial sprinkling of hypocrisy
    Has saved the fame of thousand splendid sinners,
      The loveliest oligarchs of our Gynocracy;[638]
    You may see such at all the balls and dinners,
      Among the proudest of our aristocracy,
    So gentle, charming, charitable, chaste--
    And all by having _tact_ as well as taste.

                      LXVII.

    Juan, who did not stand in the predicament
      Of a mere novice, had one safeguard more;
    For he was sick--no, 't was not the word _sick_ I meant--
      But he had seen so much good love before,
    That he was not in heart so very weak;--I meant
      But thus much, and no sneer against the shore
    Of white cliffs, white necks, blue eyes, bluer stockings--
    Tithes, taxes, duns--and doors with double knockings.[ls]

                      LXVIII.

    But coming young from lands and scenes romantic,
      Where lives, not lawsuits, must be risked for Passion
    And Passion's self must have a spice of frantic,
      Into a country where 't is half a fashion,
    Seemed to him half commercial, half pedantic,
     Howe'er he might esteem this moral nation:
    Besides (alas! his taste--forgive and pity!)
    At _first_ he did not think the women pretty.

                      LXIX.

    I say at _first_--for he found out at _last_,
      But by degrees, that they were fairer far
    Than the more glowing dames whose lot is cast
      Beneath the influence of the Eastern Star.
    A further proof we should not judge in haste;
      Yet inexperience could not be his bar
    To taste:--the truth is, if men would confess,
    That novelties _please_ less than they _impress_.

                      LXX.

    Though travelled, I have never had the luck to
      Trace up those shuffling negroes, Nile or Niger,
    To that impracticable place Timbuctoo,
      Where Geography finds no one to oblige her
    With such a chart as may be safely stuck to--
      For Europe ploughs in Afric like "_bos piger_:"[639]
    But if I _had been_ at Timbuctoo, there
    No doubt I should be told that black is fair.[lt][640]

                      LXXI.

    It is. 1 will not swear that black is white,
      But I suspect in fact that white is black,
    And the whole matter rests upon eye-sight:--
      Ask a blind man, the best judge. You'll attack
    Perhaps this new position--but I'm right;
      Or if I'm wrong, I'll not be ta'en aback:--
    He hath no morn nor night, but all is dark
    Within--and what seest thou? A dubious spark!

                      LXXII.

    But I'm relapsing into Metaphysics,
      That labyrinth, whose clue is of the same
    Construction as your cures for hectic phthisics,
      Those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame:
    And this reflection brings me to plain Physics,
      And to the beauties of a foreign dame,
    Compared with those of our pure pearls of price,
    Those polar summers, _all_ Sun, and some ice.[lu][641]

                      LXXIII.

    Or say they are like virtuous mermaids, whose
      Beginnings are fair faces, ends mere fishes;--
    Not that there's not a quantity of those
      Who have a due respect for their own wishes.
    Like Russians rushing from hot baths to snows[642]
      Are they, at bottom virtuous even when vicious:
    They warm into a scrape, but keep of course,
    As a reserve, a plunge into remorse.

                      LXXIV.

    But this has nought to do with their outsides.
      I said that Juan did not think them pretty
    At the first blush; for a fair Briton hides
      Half her attractions--probably from pity--And
    rather calmly into the heart glides,
      Than storms it as a foe would take a city;
    But once _there_ (if you doubt this, prithee try)[lv]
    She keeps it for you like a true ally.

                      LXXV.

    She cannot step as does an Arab barb,[643]
      Or Andalusian girl from mass returning,
    Nor wear as gracefully as Gauls her garb,
      Nor in her eye Ausonia's glance is burning;
    Her voice, though sweet, is not so fit to warb-
      le those _bravuras_ (which I still am learning
    To like, though I have been seven years in Italy,
    And have, or had, an ear that served me prettily);--

                      LXXVI.

    She cannot do these things, nor one or two
      Others, in that off-hand and dashing style
    Which takes so much--to give the Devil his due;
      Nor is she quite so ready with her smile,
    Nor settles all things in one interview,
      (A thing approved as saving time and toil);--
    But though the soil may give you time and trouble,
    Well cultivated, it will render double.

                      LXXVII.

    And if in fact she takes to a _grande passion_,
      It is a very serious thing indeed:
    Nine times in ten 't is but caprice or fashion,
      Coquetry, or a wish to take the lead,
    The pride of a mere child with a new sash on,
      Or wish to make a rival's bosom bleed:
    But the _tenth_ instance will be a tornado,
    For there's no saying what they will or may do.

                      LXXVIII.

    The reason's obvious: if there's an _éclat_,
      They lose their caste at once, as do the Parias;
    And when the delicacies of the Law
      Have filled their papers with their comments various,
    Society, that china without flaw,
      (The Hypocrite!) will banish them like Marius,
    To sit amidst the ruins of their guilt:[644]
    For Fame's a Carthage not so soon rebuilt.

                      LXXIX.

    Perhaps this is as it should be;--it is
      A comment on the Gospel's "Sin no more,
    And be thy sins forgiven:"--but upon this
      I leave the Saints to settle their own score.
    Abroad, though doubtless they do much amiss,
      An erring woman finds an opener door
    For her return to Virtue--as they call
    That Lady, who should be at home to all.[lw]

                      LXXX.

    For me, I leave the matter where I find it,
      Knowing that such uneasy virtue leads
    People some ten times less in fact to mind it,
      And care but for discoveries, and not deeds.
    And as for Chastity, you'll never bind it
      By all the laws the strictest lawyer pleads,
    But aggravate the crime you have not prevented,
    By rendering desperate those who had else repented.

                      LXXXI.

    But Juan was no casuist, nor had pondered
      Upon the moral lessons of mankind:
    Besides, he had not seen of several hundred
      A lady altogether to his mind.
    A little _blasé_--'t is not to be wondered
      At, that his heart had got a tougher rind:
    And though not vainer from his past success,
    No doubt his sensibilities were less.

                      LXXXII.

    He also had been busy seeing sights--
      The Parliament and all the other houses;
    Had sat beneath the Gallery at nights,
      To hear debates whose thunder _roused_ (not _rouses_)
    The World to gaze upon those Northern Lights,
      Which flashed as far as where the musk-bull browses;[645]
    He had also stood at times behind the Throne--
    But Grey[646] was not arrived, and Chatham gone.[647]

                      LXXXIII.

    He saw, however, at the closing session,
      That noble sight, when _really_ free the nation,
    A King in constitutional possession
      Of such a Throne as is the proudest station,
    Though Despots know it not--till the progression
      Of Freedom shall complete their education.
    'T is not mere Splendour makes the show august
    To eye or heart--it is the People's trust.

                      LXXXIV.

    There, too, he saw (whate'er he may be now)
      A Prince, the prince of Princes at the time,[648]
    With fascination in his very bow,
      And full of promise, as the spring of prime.
    Though Royalty was written on his brow,
      He had _then_ the grace, too, rare in every clime,
    Of being, without alloy of fop or beau,
    A finished Gentleman from top to toe.[649]

                      LXXXV.

    And Juan was received, as hath been said,
      Into the best society; and there
    Occurred what often happens, I'm afraid,
      However disciplined and debonnaire:--
    The talent and good humour he displayed,
      Besides the marked distinction of his air,
    Exposed him, as was natural, to temptation,
    Even though himself avoided the occasion.

                      LXXXVI.

    But what, and where, with whom, and when, and why,
      Is not to be put hastily together;
    And as my object is Morality
      (Whatever people say), I don't know whether
    I'll leave a single reader's eyelid dry,
      But harrow up his feelings till they wither,
    And hew out a huge monument of pathos,
    As Philip's son proposed to do with Athos.[650]

                      LXXXVII.

    Here the twelfth canto of our Introduction
      Ends. When the body of the Book's begun,
    You'll find it of a different construction
      From what some people say 't will be when done;
    The plan at present 's simply in concoction.
      I can't oblige you, reader, to read on;
    That's your affair, not mine: a real spirit
    Should neither court neglect, nor dread to bear it.

                      LXXXVIII.

    And if my thunderbolt not always rattles,
      Remember, reader! you have had before,
    The worst of tempests and the best of battles,
      That e'er were brewed from elements or gore,
    Besides the most sublime of--Heaven knows what else;
      An usurer could scarce expect much more--
    But my best canto--save one on astronomy--
    Will turn upon "Political Economy."[651]

                      LXXXIX.

    _That_ is your present theme for popularity:
      Now that the public hedge hath scarce a stake,
    It grows an act of patriotic charity,
      To show the people the best way to break.
    _My plan_ (but I, if but for singularity,
      Reserve it) will be very sure to take.
    Meantime, read all the National-Debt sinkers,
    And tell me what you think of our great thinkers.[652]

after all, _his_ is the best modern history of Greece in any language,

named his sins, it is but fair to state his virtues--learning, labour,
research, wrath, and partiality. I call the latter virtues in a writer,
because they make him write in earnest.

              CANTO THE THIRTEENTH.[653]


                      I.

    I now mean to be serious;--it is time,
      Since Laughter now-a-days is deemed too serious;
    A jest at Vice by Virtue's called a crime,
      And critically held as deleterious:
    Besides, the sad's a source of the sublime,
      Although, when long, a little apt to weary us;
    And therefore shall my lay soar high and solemn,
    As an old temple dwindled to a column.

                      II.

    The Lady Adeline Amundeville
      ('T is an old Norman name, and to be found
    In pedigrees, by those who wander still
      Along the last fields of that Gothic ground)
    Was high-born, wealthy by her father's will,
      And beauteous, even where beauties most abound,
    In Britain--which, of course, true patriots find
    The goodliest soil of Body and of Mind.

                      III.

    I'll not gainsay them; it is not my cue;
      I'll leave them to their taste, no doubt the best;
    An eye's an eye, and whether black or blue,
      Is no great matter, so 't is in request;
    'T is nonsense to dispute about a hue--
      The kindest may be taken as a test.
    The fair sex should be always fair; and no man,
    Till thirty, should perceive there's a plain woman.

                      IV.

    And after that serene and somewhat dull
      Epoch, that awkward corner turned for days
    More quiet, when our moon's no more at full,
      We may presume to criticise or praise;
    Because Indifference begins to lull
      Our passions, and we walk in Wisdom's ways;
    Also because the figure and the face
    Hint, that 't is time to give the younger place.

                      V.

    I know that some would fain postpone this era,
      Reluctant as all placemen to resign
    Their post; but theirs is merely a chimera,
      For they have passed Life's equinoctial line:
    But then they have their claret and Madeira,
      To irrigate the dryness of decline;
    And County meetings, and the Parliament,
    And debt--and what not, for their solace sent.

                      VI.

    And is there not Religion, and Reform,
      Peace, War, the taxes, and what's called the "Nation"?
    The struggle to be pilots in a storm?[654]
      The landed and the monied speculation?
    The joys of mutual hate to keep them warm,
      Instead of Love, that mere hallucination?
    Now Hatred is by far the longest pleasure;
    Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.

                      VII.

    Rough Johnson, the great moralist, professed,
      Right honestly, "he liked an honest hater!"[655]--
    The only truth that yet has been confessed
      Within these latest thousand years or later.
    Perhaps the fine old fellow spoke in jest:--
      For my part, I am but a mere spectator,
    And gaze where'er the palace or the hovel is,
    Much in the mode of Goethe's Mephistopheles;

                      VIII.

    But neither love nor hate in much excess;
      Though 't was not once so. If I sneer sometimes,
    It is because I cannot well do less,
      And now and then it also suits my rhymes.
    I should be very willing to redress
      Men's wrongs, and rather check than punish crimes,
    Had not Cervantes, in that too true tale
    Of Quixote, shown how all such efforts fail.

                      IX.[656]

    Of all tales 't is the saddest--and more sad,
      Because it makes us smile: his hero's right,
    And still pursues the right;--to curb the bad
      His only object, and 'gainst odds to fight
    His guerdon: 't is his virtue makes him mad!
      But his adventures form a sorry sight;--
    A sorrier still is the great moral taught
    By that real Epic unto all who have thought.[lx]

                      X.

    Redressing injury, revenging wrong,
      To aid the damsel and destroy the caitiff;
    Opposing singly the united strong,
      From foreign yoke to free the helpless native:--
    Alas! must noblest views, like an old song,
      Be for mere Fancy's sport a theme creative,
    A jest, a riddle, Fame through thin and thick sought!
    And Socrates himself but Wisdom's Quixote?

                      XI.

    Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away;
      A single laugh demolished the right arm
    Of his own country;--seldom since that day
      Has Spain had heroes. While Romance could charm,
    The World gave ground before her bright array;
      And therefore have his volumes done such harm,
    That all their glory, as a composition,
    Was dearly purchased by his land's perdition.

                      XII.

    I'm "at my old lunes"[657]--digression, and forget
      The Lady Adeline Amundeville;
    The fair most fatal Juan ever met,
      Although she was not evil nor meant ill;
    But Destiny and Passion spread the net
      (Fate is a good excuse for our own will),
    And caught them;--what do they _not_ catch, methinks?
    But I'm not Oedipus, and Life's a Sphinx.

                      XIII.

    I tell the tale as it is told, nor dare
      To venture a solution: "_Davus sum!_"[658]
    And now I will proceed upon the pair.
      Sweet Adeline, amidst the gay World's hum,
    Was the Queen-Bee, the glass of all that's fair;
      Whose charms made all men speak, and women dumb.
    The last's a miracle, and such was reckoned,
    And since that time there has not been a second.

                      XIV.

    Chaste was she, to Detraction's desperation,
      And wedded unto one she had loved well--
    A man known in the councils of the Nation,
      Cool, and quite English, imperturbable,
    Though apt to act with fire upon occasion,
      Proud of himself and her: the World could tell
    Nought against either, and both seemed secure--
    She in her virtue, he in his hauteur.

                      XV.

    It chanced some diplomatical relations,
      Arising out of business, often brought
    Himself and Juan in their mutual stations
      Into close contact. Though reserved, nor caught
    By specious seeming, Juan's youth, and patience,
      And talent, on his haughty spirit wrought,
    And formed a basis of esteem, which ends
    In making men what Courtesy calls friends.

                      XVI.

    And thus Lord Henry, who was cautious as
      Reserve and Pride could make him, and full slow
    In judging men--when once his judgment was
      Determined, right or wrong, on friend or foe,
    Had all the pertinacity Pride has,
      Which knows no ebb to its imperious flow,
    And loves or hates, disdaining to be guided,
    Because its own good pleasure hath decided.

                      XVII.

    His friendships, therefore, and no less aversions,
      Though oft well founded, which confirmed but more
    His prepossessions, like the laws of Persians
      And Medes, would ne'er revoke what went before.
    His feelings had not those strange fits, like tertians,
      Of common likings, which make some deplore
    What they should laugh at--the mere ague still
    Of men's regard, the fever or the chill.

                      XVIII.

    "'T is not in mortals to command success:"[659]
      But _do you more_, Sempronius--_don't_ deserve it,
    And take my word, you won't have any less.
      Be wary, watch the time, and always serve it;
    Give gently way, when there's too great a press;
      And for your conscience, only learn to nerve it;
    For, like a racer, or a boxer training,
    'T will make, if proved, vast efforts without paining.

                      XIX.

    Lord Henry also liked to be superior,
      As most men do, the little or the great;
    The very lowest find out an inferior,
      At least they think so, to exert their state
    Upon: for there are very few things wearier
      Than solitary Pride's oppressive weight,
    Which mortals generously would divide,
    By bidding others carry while they ride.

                      XX.

    In birth, in rank, in fortune likewise equal,
      O'er Juan he could no distinction claim;
    In years he had the advantage of Time's sequel;
      And, as he thought, in country much the same--
    Because bold Britons have a tongue and free quill,
      At which all modern nations vainly aim;
    And the Lord Henry was a great debater,
    So that few Members kept the House up later.

                      XXI.

    These were advantages: and then he thought--
      It was his foible, but by no means sinister--
    That few or none more than himself had caught
      Court mysteries, having been himself a minister:
    He liked to teach that which he had been taught,
      And greatly shone whenever there had been a stir;
    And reconciled all qualities which grace man,
    Always a patriot--and, sometimes, a placeman.

                      XXII.

    He liked the gentle Spaniard for his gravity;
      He almost honoured him for his docility;
    Because, though young, he acquiesced with suavity,
      Or contradicted but with proud humility.
    He knew the World, and would not see depravity
      In faults which sometimes show the soil's fertility,
    If that the weeds o'erlive not the first crop--
    For then they are very difficult to stop.

                      XXIII.

    And then he talked with him about Madrid,
      Constantinople, and such distant places;
    Where people always did as they were bid,
      Or did what they should not with foreign graces.
    Of coursers also spake they: Henry rid
      Well, like most Englishmen, and loved the races;
    And Juan, like a true-born Andalusian,
    Could back[660] a horse, as Despots ride a Russian.

                      XXIV.

    And thus acquaintance grew, at noble routs,
      And diplomatic dinners, or at other--
    For Juan stood well both with Ins and Outs,
      As in freemasonry a higher brother.
    Upon his talent Henry had no doubts;
      His manner showed him sprung from a high mother,
    And all men like to show their hospitality
    To him whose breeding matches with his quality.

                      XXV.

    At Blank-Blank Square;--for we will break no squares[661]
      By naming streets: since men are so censorious,
    And apt to sow an author's wheat with tares,
      Reaping allusions private and inglorious,
    Where none were dreamt of, unto Love's affairs,
      Which were, or are, or are to be notorious,
    That therefore do I previously declare,
    Lord Henry's mansion was in Blank-Blank Square.

                      XXVI.

    Also there bin[662] another pious reason
      For making squares and streets anonymous;
    Which is, that there is scarce a single season
      Which doth not shake some very splendid house
    With some slight heart-quake of domestic treason--
      A topic Scandal doth delight to rouse:
    Such I might stumble over unawares,
    Unless I knew the very chastest squares.

                      XXVII.

    'T is true, I might have chosen Piccadilly,[663]
      A place where peccadillos are unknown;
    But I have motives, whether wise or silly,
      For letting that pure sanctuary alone.
    Therefore I name not square, street, place, until I
      Find one where nothing naughty can be shown,
    A vestal shrine of Innocence of Heart:
    Such are--but I have lost the London Chart.

                      XXVIII.

    At Henry's mansion then, in Blank-Blank Square,
      Was Juan a _recherché_, welcome guest,
    As many other noble scions were;
      And some who had but Talent for their crest;
    Or Wealth, which is a passport everywhere;
      Or even mere Fashion, which indeed's the best
    Recommendation; and to be well dressed
    Will very often supersede the rest.

                      XXIX.

    And since "there's safety in a multitude
      Of counsellors," as Solomon has said,
    Or some one for him, in some sage, grave mood;--
      Indeed we see the daily proof displayed
    In Senates, at the Bar, in wordy feud,
      Where'er collective wisdom can parade,
    Which is the only cause that we can guess
    Of Britain's present wealth and happiness;--

                      XXX.

    But as "there's safety" grafted in the number
      "Of counsellors," for men,--thus for the sex
    A large acquaintance lets not Virtue slumber;
      Or should it shake, the choice will more perplex--
    Variety itself will more encumber.[ly]
      'Midst many rocks we guard more against wrecks--
    And thus with women: howsoe'er it shocks some's
    Self-love, there's safety in a crowd of coxcombs.

                      XXXI.

    But Adeline had not the least occasion
      For such a shield, which leaves but little merit
    To Virtue proper, or good education.
      Her chief resource was in her own high spirit,
    Which judged Mankind at their due estimation;
      And for coquetry, she disdained to wear it--
    Secure of admiration: its impression
    Was faint--as of an every-day possession.

                      XXXII.

    To all she was polite without parade;
      To some she showed attention of that kind
    Which flatters, but is flattery conveyed
      In such a sort as cannot leave behind
    A trace unworthy either wife or maid;--
      A gentle, genial courtesy of mind,[lz]
    To those who were, or passed for meritorious,
    Just to console sad Glory for being glorious;

                      XXXIII.

    Which is in all respects, save now and then,
      A dull and desolate appendage. Gaze
    Upon the shades of those distinguished men
      Who were or are the puppet-shows of praise,
    The praise of persecution. Gaze again
      On the most favoured; and amidst the blaze
    Of sunset halos o'er the laurel-browed,
    What can ye recognise?--a gilded cloud.

                      XXXIV.

    There also was of course in Adeline
      That calm patrician polish in the address,
    Which ne'er can pass the equinoctial line
      Of anything which Nature would express;
    Just as a Mandarin finds nothing fine,--
      At least his manner suffers not to guess,
    That anything he views can greatly please:
    Perhaps we have borrowed this from the Chinese--[ma]

                      XXXV.

    Perhaps from Horace: his _"Nil admirari"_
      Was what he called the "Art of Happiness"--
    An art on which the artists greatly vary,
      And have not yet attained to much success.
    However, 't is expedient to be wary:
      Indifference, certes, don't produce distress;
    And rash Enthusiasm in good society
    Were nothing but a moral inebriety.

                      XXXVI.

    But Adeline was not indifferent: for
      (_Now_ for a common-place!) beneath the snow,
    As a Volcano holds the lava more
      Within--_et cætera_. Shall I go on?--No!
    I hate to hunt down a tired metaphor,
      So let the often-used Volcano go.
    Poor thing! How frequently, by me and others,
    It hath been stirred up till its smoke quite smothers!

                      XXXVII.

    I'll have another figure in a trice:--
      What say you to a bottle of champagne?
    Frozen into a very vinous ice,
      Which leaves few drops of that immortal rain,
    Yet in the very centre, past all price,
      About a liquid glassful will remain;
    And this is stronger than the strongest grape
    Could e'er express in its expanded shape:

                      XXXVIII.

    'T is the whole spirit brought to a quintessence;
      And thus the chilliest aspects may concentre
    A hidden nectar under a cold presence.[mb]
      And such are many--though I only meant her
    From whom I now deduce these moral lessons,
      On which the Muse has always sought to enter.
    And your cold people are beyond all price,
    When once you've broken their confounded ice.

                      XXXIX.

    But after all they are a North-West Passage
      Unto the glowing India of the soul;
    And as the good ships sent upon that message
      Have not exactly ascertained the Pole
    (Though Parry's efforts look a lucky presage),[mc]
      Thus gentlemen may run upon a shoal;
    For if the Pole's not open, but all frost
    (A chance still), 't is a voyage or vessel lost.

                      XL.

    And young beginners may as well commence
      With quiet cruising o'er the ocean, Woman;
    While those who are not beginners should have sense
      Enough to make for port, ere Time shall summon
    With his grey signal-flag; and the past tense,
      The dreary _Fuimus_ of all things human,
    Must be declined, while Life's thin thread's spun out
    Between the gaping heir and gnawing gout.

                      XLI.

    But Heaven must be diverted; its diversion
      Is sometimes truculent--but never mind:
    The World upon the whole is worth the assertion
      (If but for comfort) that all things are kind:
    And that same devilish doctrine of the Persian,[664]
      Of the "Two Principles," but leaves behind
    As many doubts as any other doctrine
    Has ever puzzled Faith withal, or yoked her in,

                      XLII.

    The English winter--ending in July,
      To recommence in August--now was done.
    'T is the postilion's paradise: wheels fly;
      On roads, East, South, North, West, there is a run.
    But for post-horses who finds sympathy?
      Man's pity's for himself, or for his son,
    Always premising that said son at college
    Has not contracted much more debt than knowledge.

                      XLIII.

    The London winter's ended in July--
      Sometimes a little later. I don't err
    In this: whatever other blunders lie
      Upon my shoulders, here I must aver
    My Muse a glass of _Weatherology_;
      For Parliament is our barometer:
    Let Radicals its other acts attack,
    Its sessions form our only almanack.

                      XLIV.

    When its quicksilver's down at zero,--lo!
      Coach, chariot, luggage, baggage, equipage!
    Wheels whirl from Carlton Palace to Soho,
      And happiest they who horses can engage;
    The turnpikes glow with dust; and Rotten Row
      Sleeps from the chivalry of this bright age;
    And tradesmen, with long bills and longer faces,
    Sigh--as the postboys fasten on the traces.

                      XLV.

    They and their bills, "Arcadians both,"[665] are left
      To the Greek Kalends of another session.
    Alas! to them of ready cash bereft,
      What hope remains? Of _hope_ the full possession,
    Or generous draft, conceded as a gift,
      At a long date--till they can get a fresh one--
    Hawked about at a discount, small or large;
    Also the solace of an overcharge.

                      XLVI.

    But these are trifles. Downward flies my Lord,
      Nodding beside my Lady in his carriage.
    Away! away! "Fresh horses!" are the word,
      And changed as quickly as hearts after marriage;
    The obsequious landlord hath the change restored;
      The postboys have no reason to disparage
    Their fee; but ere the watered wheels may hiss hence,
    The ostler pleads too for a reminiscence.

                      XLVII.

    'T is granted; and the valet mounts the dickey--
      That gentleman of Lords and Gentlemen;
    Also my Lady's gentlewoman, tricky,
      Tricked out, but modest more than poet's pen
    Can paint,--_"Cosi viaggino i Ricchi!"_[666]
      (Excuse a foreign slipslop now and then,
    If but to show I've travelled: and what's Travel,
    Unless it teaches one to quote and cavil?)

                      XLVIII.

    The London winter and the country summer
      Were well nigh over. 'T is perhaps a pity,
    When Nature wears the gown that doth become her,
      To lose those best months in a sweaty city,
    And wait until the nightingale grows dumber,
      Listening debates not very wise or witty,
    Ere patriots their true _country_ can remember;--
    But there's no shooting (save grouse) till September.

                      XLIX.

    I've done with my tirade. The World was gone;
      The twice two thousand, for whom Earth was made,
    Were vanished to be what they call alone--
      That is, with thirty servants for parade,
    As many guests, or more; before whom groan
      As many covers, duly, daily laid.
    Let none accuse old England's hospitality--
    Its quantity is but condensed to quality.

                      L.

    Lord Henry and the Lady Adeline
      Departed like the rest of their compeers,
    The peerage, to a mansion very fine;
      The Gothic Babel of a thousand years.
    None than themselves could boast a longer line,
      Where Time through heroes and through beauties steers;
    And oaks as olden as their pedigree
    Told of their Sires--a tomb in every tree.

                      LI.

    A paragraph in every paper told
      Of their departure--such is modern fame:
    'T is pity that it takes no further hold
      Than an advertisement, or much the same;
    When, ere the ink be dry, the sound grows cold.
      The Morning Post was foremost to proclaim--
    "Departure, for his country seat, to-day,
    Lord H. Amundeville and Lady A.

                      LII.

    "We understand the splendid host intends[md]
      To entertain, this autumn, a select
    And numerous party of his noble friends;
      'Midst whom we have heard, from sources quite correct,
    The Duke of D---- the shooting season spends,
      With many more by rank and fashion decked;
    Also a foreigner of high condition,
    The envoy of the secret Russian mission."

                      LIII.

    And thus we see--who doubts the Morning Post?
      (Whose articles are like the "Thirty-nine,"
    Which those most swear to who believe them most)--
      Our gay Russ Spaniard was ordained to shine,
    Decked by the rays reflected from his host,
      With those who, Pope says, "greatly daring dine."--[667]
    'T is odd, but true,--last war the News abounded
    More with these dinners than the killed or wounded;--

                      LIV.

    As thus: "On Thursday there was a grand dinner;
      Present, Lords A.B.C."--- Earls, dukes, by name
    Announced with no less pomp than Victory's winner:
      Then underneath, and in the very same
    Column: date, "Falmouth. There has lately been here
      The Slap-dash regiment, so well known to Fame,
    Whose loss in the late action we regret:
    The vacancies are filled up--see Gazette."

                      LV.

    To Norman Abbey[668] whirled the noble pair,--
      An old, old Monastery once, and now
    Still older mansion--of a rich and rare
      Mixed Gothic, such as artists all allow
    Few specimens yet left us can compare
      Withal: it lies, perhaps, a little low,
    Because the monks preferred a hill behind,
    To shelter their devotion from the wind.

                      LVI.

    It stood embosomed in a happy valley,
      Crowned by high woodlands, where the Druid oak[669]
    Stood like Caractacus, in act to rally
      His host, with broad arms 'gainst the thunder-stroke;
    And from beneath his boughs were seen to sally
      The dappled foresters; as Day awoke,
    The branching stag swept down with all his herd,
    To quaff a brook which murmured like a bird.

                      LVII.

    Before the mansion lay a lucid Lake,[670]
      Broad as transparent, deep, and freshly fed
    By a river, which its softened way did take
      In currents through the calmer water spread
    Around: the wildfowl nestled in the brake
      And sedges, brooding in their liquid bed:
    The woods[671] sloped downwards to its brink, and stood
    With their green faces fixed upon the flood.

                      LVIII.

    Its outlet dashed into a deep cascade,
      Sparkling with foam, until again subsiding,
    Its shriller echoes--like an infant made[me]
      Quiet--sank into softer ripples, gliding
    Into a rivulet; and thus allayed,
      Pursued its course, now gleaming, and now hiding
    Its windings through the woods; now clear, now blue,
    According as the skies their shadows threw.

                      LIX.

    A glorious remnant of the Gothic pile
      (While yet the Church was Rome's) stood half apart
    In a grand Arch, which once screened many an aisle.
      These last had disappeared--a loss to Art:
    The first yet frowned superbly o'er the soil,
      And kindled feelings in the roughest heart,
    Which mourned the power of Time's or Tempest's march,
    In gazing on that venerable Arch.[mf]

                      LX.

    Within a niche, nigh to its pinnacle,
      Twelve Saints had once stood sanctified in stone;
    But these had fallen, not when the friars fell,
      But in the war which struck Charles from his throne,
    When each house was a fortalice--as tell
      The annals of full many a line undone,--
    The gallant Cavaliers,[672] who fought in vain
    For those who knew not to resign or reign.

                      LXI.

    But in a higher niche, alone, but crowned,
      The Virgin-Mother of the God-born Child,
    With her Son in her blesséd arms, looked round,
      Spared by some chance when all beside was spoiled:
    She made the earth below seem holy ground.
      This may be superstition, weak or wild;
    But even the faintest relics of a shrine
    Of any worship wake some thoughts divine.

                      LXII.

    A mighty window, hollow in the centre,
      Shorn of its glass of thousand colourings,
    Through which the deepened glories once could enter,
      Streaming from off the Sun like Seraph's wings,
    Now yawns all desolate: now loud, now fainter,
      The gale sweeps through its fretwork, and oft sings
    The owl his anthem, where the silenced quire
    Lie with their Hallelujahs quenched like fire.

                      LXIII.

    But in the noontide of the moon, and when[mg]
      The wind is wingéd from one point of heaven,
    There moans a strange unearthly sound, which then
      Is musical--a dying accent driven
    Through the huge Arch, which soars and sinks again.
      Some deem it but the distant echo given
    Back to the night wind by the waterfall,
    And harmonised by the old choral wall:

                      LXIV.

    Others, that some original shape, or form
      Shaped by decay perchance, hath given the power
    (Though less than that of Memnon's statue,[673] warm
      In Egypt's rays, to harp at a fixed hour)
    To this grey ruin: with a voice to charm,
      Sad, but serene, it sweeps o'er tree or tower;
    The cause I know not, nor can solve; but such
    The fact:--I've heard it,--once perhaps too much.[674]

                      LXV.

    Amidst the court a Gothic fountain played,
      Symmetrical, but decked with carvings quaint--
    Strange faces, like to men in masquerade,
      And here perhaps a monster, there a saint:
    The spring gushed through grim mouths of granite made,
      And sparkled into basins, where it spent
    Its little torrent in a thousand bubbles,
    Like man's vain Glory, and his vainer troubles.

                      LXVI.

    The Mansion's self was vast and venerable,
      With more of the monastic than has been
    Elsewhere preserved: the cloisters still were stable,
      The cells, too, and Refectory, I ween:
    An exquisite small chapel had been able,
      Still unimpaired, to decorate the scene;
    The rest had been reformed, replaced, or sunk,
    And spoke more of the baron than the monk.

                      LXVII.

    Huge halls, long galleries, spacious chambers, joined
      By no quite lawful marriage of the arts,
    Might shock a connoisseur; but when combined,
      Formed a whole which, irregular in parts,
    Yet left a grand impression on the mind,
      At least of those whose eyes are in their hearts:
    We gaze upon a giant for his stature,
    Nor judge at first if all be true to nature.

                      LXVIII.

    Steel Barons, molten the next generation
      To silken rows of gay and gartered Earls,
    Glanced from the walls in goodly preservation:
      And Lady Marys blooming into girls,
    With fair long locks, had also kept their station:
      And Countesses mature in robes and pearls:
    Also some beauties of Sir Peter Lely,
    Whose drapery hints we may admire them freely.

                      LXIX.

    Judges in very formidable ermine
      Were there, with brows that did not much invite
    The accused to think their lordships would determine
      His cause by leaning much from might to right:
    Bishops, who had not left a single sermon;
      Attorneys-general, awful to the sight,
    As hinting more (unless our judgments warp us)
    Of the "Star Chamber" than of "Habeas Corpus."

                      LXX.

    Generals, some all in armour, of the old
      And iron time, ere lead had ta'en the lead;
    Others in wigs of Marlborough's martial fold,
      Huger than twelve of our degenerate breed:[mh]
    Lordlings, with staves of white or keys of gold:
      Nimrods, whose canvas scarce contained the steed;
    And, here and there, some stern high patriot stood,
    Who could not get the place for which he sued.

                      LXXI.

    But ever and anon, to soothe your vision,
      Fatigued with these hereditary glories,
    There rose a Carlo Dolce or a Titian,
      Or wilder group of savage Salvatore's:[675]
    Here danced Albano's boys, and here the sea shone
      In Vernet's ocean lights; and there the stories
    Of martyrs awed, as Spagnoletto tainted
    His brush with all the blood of all the sainted.

                      LXXII.

    Here sweetly spread a landscape of Lorraine;
      There Rembrandt made his darkness equal light,
    Or gloomy Caravaggio's gloomier stain
      Bronzed o'er some lean and stoic anchorite:--
    But, lo! a Teniers woos, and not in vain,
      Your eyes to revel in a livelier sight:
    His bell-mouthed goblet makes me feel quite Danish[676]
    Or Dutch with thirst--What, ho! a flask of Rhenish.[mi]

                      LXXIII.

    Oh, reader! if that thou canst read,--and know,
      'T is not enough to spell, or even to read,
    To constitute a reader--there must go
      Virtues of which both you and I have need;--
    Firstly, begin with the beginning--(though
      That clause is hard); and secondly, proceed:
    Thirdly, commence not with the end--or, sinning
    In this sort, end at last with the beginning.

                      LXXIV.

    But, reader, thou hast patient been of late,
      While I, without remorse of rhyme, or fear,
    Have built and laid out ground at such a rate,
      Dan Phoebus takes me for an auctioneer.
    That Poets were so from their earliest date,
      By Homer's "Catalogue of ships" is clear;
    But a mere modern must be moderate--
    I spare you then the furniture and plate.

                      LXXV.

    The mellow Autumn came, and with it came
      The promised party, to enjoy its sweets.
    The corn is cut, the manor full of game;
      The pointer ranges, and the sportsman beats
    In russet jacket:--lynx-like in his aim;
      Full grows his bag, and wonder_ful_ his feats.
    Ah, nutbrown partridges! Ah, brilliant pheasants!
    And ah, ye poachers!--'T is no sport for peasants.

                      LXXVI.

    An English Autumn, though it hath no vines,
      Blushing with Bacchant coronals along
    The paths o'er which the far festoon entwines
      The red grape in the sunny lands of song,
    Hath yet a purchased choice of choicest wines;[mj]
      The Claret light, and the Madeira strong.
    If Britain mourn her bleakness, we can tell her,
    The very best of vineyards is the cellar.

                      LXXVII.

    Then, if she hath not that serene decline
      Which makes the southern Autumn's day appear
    As if 't would to a second Spring resign
      The season, rather than to Winter drear,--
    Of in-door comforts still she hath a mine,--
      The sea-coal fires,[677] the "earliest of the year;"[678]
    Without doors, too, she may compete in mellow,
    As what is lost in green is gained in yellow.

                      LXXVIII.

    And for the effeminate _villeggialura_--
      Rife with more horns than hounds--she hath the chase,
    So animated that it might allure a
      Saint from his beads to join the jocund race:
    Even Nimrod's self might leave the plains of Dura,[679]
      And wear the Melton jacket for a space:
    If she hath no wild boars, she hath a tame
    Preserve of bores, who ought to be made game.[mk]

                      LXXIX.

    The noble guests,[680] assembled at the Abbey,
      Consisted of--we give the sex the _pas_--
    The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke; the Countess Crabby;[ml][681]
      The Ladies Scilly, Busey;--Miss Eclat,
    Miss Bombazeen, Miss Mackstay, Miss O'Tabby,
      And Mrs. Rabbi,[682] the rich banker's squaw;
    Also the honourable Mrs. Sleep,
    Who looked a white lamb, yet was a black sheep:

                      LXXX.

    With other Countesses of Blank--but rank;
      At once the "lie"[683] and the _élite_ of crowds;
    Who pass like water filtered in a tank,
      All purged and pious from their native clouds;
    Or paper turned to money by the Bank:
      No matter how or why, the passport shrouds
    The _passée_ and the past; for good society
    Is no less famed for tolerance than piety,--

                      LXXXI.

    That is, up to a certain point; which point
      Forms the most difficult in punctuation.
    Appearances appear to form the joint
      On which it hinges in a higher station;
    And so that no explosion cry "Aroint
      Thee, witch!"[684] or each Medea has her Jason;
    Or (to the point with Horace and with Pulci)[mm]
    _"Omne tulit punctum,_ quæ _miscuit utile dulci."_[685]

                      LXXXII.

    I can't exactly trace their rule of right,
      Which hath a little leaning to a lottery.
    I've seen a virtuous woman put down quite
      By the mere combination of a coterie;
    Also a so-so matron boldly fight
      Her way back to the world by dint of plottery,[mn]
    And shine the very _Siria_,[686] of the spheres,
    Escaping with a few slight, scarless sneers.

                      LXXXIII.

    I have seen more than I'll say:--but we will see[mo]
      How _our "villeggiatura"_ will get on.
    The party might consist of thirty-three
      Of highest caste--the Brahmins of the _ton_.
    I have named a few, not foremost in degree,
      But ta'en at hazard as the rhyme may run.
    By way of sprinkling, scattered amongst these,
    There also were some Irish absentees.

                      LXXXIV.

    There was Parolles,[687] too, the legal bully,[mp]
      Who limits all his battles to the Bar
    And Senate: when invited elsewhere, truly,
      He shows more appetite for words than war.
    There was the young bard Rackrhyme, who had newly
      Come out and glimmered as a six weeks' star.
    There was Lord Pyrrho, too, the great freethinker;
    And Sir John Pottledeep, the mighty drinker.

                      LXXXV.

    There was the Duke of Dash,[688] who was a--duke,
      "Aye, every inch a" duke; there were twelve peers
    Like Charlemagne's--and all such peers in _look_
      And _intellect_, that neither eyes nor ears
    For commoners had ever them mistook.
      There were the six Miss Rawbolds--pretty dears!
    All song and sentiment; whose hearts were set
    Less on a convent than a coronet.

                      LXXXVI.

    There were four Honourable Misters, whose
      Honour was more before their names than after;
    There was the _preux Chevalier de la Ruse_,[689]
      Whom France and Fortune lately deigned to waft here,
    Whose chiefly harmless talent was to amuse;
      But the clubs found it rather serious laughter,
    Because--such was his magic power to please--
    The dice seemed charmed, too, with his repartees.

                      LXXXVII.

    There was Dick Dubious,[690] the metaphysician,
      Who loved philosophy and a good dinner;
    Angle, the _soi-disant_ mathematician;
      Sir Henry Silvercup, the great race-winner.
    There was the Reverend Rodomont Precisian,
      Who did not hate so much the sin as sinner:
    And Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet,
    Good at all things, but better at a bet.

                      LXXXVIII.

    There was Jack Jargon, the gigantic guardsman;[691]
      And General Fireface,[692] famous in the field,
    A great tactician, and no less a swordsman,
      Who ate, last war, more Yankees than he killed.
    There was the waggish Welsh Judge, Jefferies Hardsman,
      In his grave office so completely skilled,
    That when a culprit came for condemnation,
    He had his Judge's joke for consolation.[693]

                      LXXXIX.

    Good company's a chess-board--there are kings,
      Queens, bishops, knights, rooks, pawns; the World's a game;
    Save that the puppets pull at their own strings,
      Methinks gay Punch hath something of the same.
    My Muse, the butterfly hath but her wings,
      Not stings, and flits through ether without aim,
    Alighting rarely:--were she but a hornet,
    Perhaps there might be vices which would mourn it.

                      XC.

    I had forgotten--but must not forget--
      An orator, the latest of the session,
    Who had delivered well a very set
      Smooth speech, his first and maidenly transgression
    Upon debate: the papers echoed yet
      With his _début_, which made a strong impression,
    And ranked with what is every day displayed--
    "The best first speech that ever yet was made."

                      XCI.

    Proud of his "Hear hims!" proud, too, of his vote,
      And lost virginity of oratory,
    Proud of his learning (just enough to quote),
      He revelled in his Ciceronian glory:
    With memory excellent to get by rote,
      With wit to hatch a pun or tell a story,
    Graced with some merit, and with more effrontery,[mq]
    "His country's pride," he came down to the country.

                      XCII.

    There also were two wits by acclamation,
      Longbow from Ireland,[694] Strongbow from the Tweed[695]--Both
    lawyers and both men of education--
      But Strongbow's wit was of more polished breed;
    Longbow was rich in an imagination
      As beautiful and bounding as a steed,
    But sometimes stumbling over a potato,--
    While Strongbow's best things might have come from Cato.

                      XCIII.

    Strongbow was like a new-tuned harpsichord;
      But Longbow wild as an Æolian harp,
    With which the Winds of heaven can claim accord,
      And make a music, whether flat or sharp.
    Of Strongbow's talk you would not change a word:
      At Longbow's phrases you might sometimes carp:
    Both wits--one born so, and the other bred--
    This by his heart--his rival by his head.

                      XCIV.

    If all these seem an heterogeneous mass
      To be assembled at a country seat,
    Yet think, a specimen of every class
      Is better than a humdrum tête-à-tête.
    The days of Comedy are gone, alas!
      When Congreve's fool could vie with Molière's _bête_:
    Society is smoothed to that excess,
    That manners hardly differ more than dress.

                      XCV.

    Our ridicules are kept in the back-ground--
      Ridiculous enough, but also dull;
    Professions, too, are no more to be found
      Professional; and there is nought to cull[mr]
    Of Folly's fruit; for though your fools abound,
      They're barren, and not worth the pains to pull.
    Society is now one polished horde,
    Formed of two mighty tribes, the _Bores_ and _Bored_.

                      XCVI.

    But from being farmers, we turn gleaners, gleaning
      The scanty but right-well threshed ears of Truth;
    And, gentle reader! when you gather meaning,
      You may be Boaz, and I--modest Ruth.
    Further I'd quote, but Scripture intervening
      Forbids. A great impression in my youth
    Was made by Mrs. Adams, where she cries,
    "That Scriptures out of church are blasphemies."[696]

                      XCVII.

    But what we can we glean in this vile age[ms]
      Of chaff, although our gleanings be not grist.
    I must not quite omit the talking sage,
      Kit-Cat, the famous Conversationist,[697]
    Who, in his common-place book, had a page
      Prepared each morn for evenings. "List, oh list!"
    "Alas, poor ghost!"[698]--What unexpected woes
    Await those who have studied their _bons-mots!_

                      XCVIII.

    Firstly, they must allure the conversation,
      By many windings to their clever clinch;
    And secondly, must let slip no occasion,
      Nor _bate_ (abate) their hearers of an _inch_,[mt]
    But take an ell--and make a great sensation,
      If possible; and thirdly, never flinch
    When some smart talker puts them to the test,
    But seize the last word, which no doubt's the best.

                      XCIX.

    Lord Henry and his lady were the hosts;
      The party we have touched on were the guests.
    Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts
      To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.
    I will not dwell upon _ragoûts_ or roasts,
      Albeit all human history attests
    That happiness for Man--the hungry sinner!--
    Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.

                      C.

    Witness the lands which "flowed with milk and honey,"
      Held out unto the hungry Israelites:
    To this we have added since, the love of money,
      The only sort of pleasure which requites.
    Youth fades, and leaves our days no longer sunny;
      We tire of mistresses and parasites;
    But oh, ambrosial cash! Ah! who would lose thee?
    When we no more can use, or even abuse thee!

                      CI.

    The gentlemen got up betimes to shoot,
      Or hunt: the young, because they liked the sport--
    The first thing boys like after play and fruit;
      The middle-aged, to make the day more short;
    For _ennui_[699] is a growth of English root,
      Though nameless in our language:--we retort
    The fact for words, and let the French translate
    That awful yawn which sleep can not abate.

                      CII.

    The elderly walked through the library,
      And tumbled books, or criticised the pictures,
    Or sauntered through the gardens piteously,
      And made upon the hot-house several strictures,
    Or rode a nag which trotted not too high,
      Or on the morning papers read their lectures,
    Or on the watch their longing eyes would fix,
    Longing at sixty for the hour of six.

                      CIII.

    But none were _gêné_: the great hour of union
      Was rung by dinner's knell; till then all were
    Masters of their own time--or in communion,
      Or solitary, as they chose to bear
    The hours, which how to pass is but to few known.
      Each rose up at his own, and had to spare
    What time he chose for dress, and broke his fast
    When, where, and how he chose for that repast.

                      CIV.

    The ladies--some rouged, some a little pale--
      Met the morn as they might. If fine, they rode,
    Or walked; if foul, they read, or told a tale,
      Sung, or rehearsed the last dance from abroad;
    Discussed the fashion which might next prevail,
      And settled bonnets by the newest code,
    Or crammed twelve sheets into one little letter,
    To make each correspondent a new debtor.

                      CV.

    For some had absent lovers, all had friends;
      The earth has nothing like a she epistle,
    And hardly Heaven--because it never ends--
      I love the mystery of a female missal,
    Which, like a creed, ne'er says all it intends,
      But full of cunning as Ulysses' whistle,[mu]
    When he allured poor Dolon:[700]--you had better
    Take care what you reply to such a letter.

                      CVI.

    Then there were billiards; cards, too, but _no_ dice;--
      Save in the clubs no man of honour plays;--
    Boats when 't was water, skating when 't was ice,
      And the hard frost destroyed the scenting days:
    And angling, too, that solitary vice,
      Whatever Izaak Walton sings or says:
    The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb, in his gullet
    Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.[701]

                      CVII.

    With evening came the banquet and the wine;
      The conversazione--the duet
    Attuned by voices more or less divine
      (My heart or head aches with the memory yet).
    The four Miss Rawbolds in a glee would shine;
      But the two youngest loved more to be set
    Down to the harp--because to Music's charms
    They added graceful necks, white hands and arms.

                      CVIII.

    Sometimes a dance (though rarely on field days,
      For then the gentlemen were rather tired)
    Displayed some sylph-like figures in its maze;
      Then there was small-talk ready when required;
    Flirtation--but decorous; the mere praise
      Of charms that should or should not be admired.
    The hunters fought their fox-hunt o'er again,
    And then retreated soberly--at ten.

                      CIX.

    The politicians, in a nook apart,
      Discussed the World, and settled all the spheres:
    The wits watched every loophole for their art,
      To introduce a _bon-mot_ head and ears;
    Small is the rest of those who would be smart,
      A moment's good thing may have cost them years
    Before they find an hour to introduce it;
    And then, even _then_, some bore may make them lose it.

                      CX.

    But all was gentle and aristocratic
      In this our party; polished, smooth, and cold,
    As Phidian forms cut out of marble Attic.
      There now are no Squire Westerns, as of old;
    And our Sophias are not so emphatic,
      But fair as then, or fairer to behold:
    We have no accomplished blackguards, like Tom Jones,
    But gentlemen in stays, as stiff as stones.

                      CXI.

    They separated at an early hour;
      That is, ere midnight--which is London's noon:
    But in the country ladies seek their bower
      A little earlier than the waning moon.
    Peace to the slumbers of each folded flower--
      May the rose call back its true colour soon!
    Good hours of fair cheeks are the fairest tinters,
    And lower the price of rouge--at least some winters.[702]

{495}[668] [Byron's description of the place of his inheritance, which
was to know him no more, is sketched from memory, but it unites the
charm of a picture with the accuracy of a ground-plan. Eight years had
gone by since he had looked his last on "venerable arch" and "lucid
lake" (see "Epistle to Augusta," stanza viii. lines 7, 8), but he had
not forgotten, he could not forget, that enchanted and enchanting scene.

Newstead Abbey or Priory was founded by Henry II., by way of deodand or
expiation for the murder of Thomas Becket. Lands which bordered the
valley of the Leen, and which had formed part of Sherwood Forest, were
assigned for the use and endowment of a chapter of "black canons regular
of the order of St. Augustine," and on a site, by the river-side to the
south of the forest uplands (stanza lv. lines 5-8) the new stede, or
place, or station, arose. It was a "Norman Abbey" (stanza lv. line 1)
which the Black Canons dedicated to Our Lady, and, here and there, in
the cloisters, traces of Norman architecture remain, but the enlargement
and completion of the monastery was carried out in successive stages and
"transition periods," in a style or styles which, perhaps, more by hap
than by cunning, Byron rightly named "mixed Gothic" (stanza lv. line 4).
To work their mills, and perhaps to drain the marshy valley, the monks
dammed the Leen and excavated a chain of lakes--the largest to the
north-west, Byron's "lucid lake;" a second to the south of the Abbey;
and a third, now surrounded with woods, and overlooked by the "wicked
lord's" "ragged rock" below the Abbey, half a mile to the south-east.
The "cascade," which flows over and through a stone-work sluice, and
forms a rocky water-fall, issues from the upper lake, and is in full
view of the west front of the Abbey. Almost at right angles to these
lakes are three ponds: the Forest Pond to the north of the stone wall,
which divides the garden from the forest; the square "Eagle" Pond in the
Monks' Garden; and the narrow stew-pond, bordered on either side with
overhanging yews, which drains into the second or Garden Lake. Byron
does not enlarge on this double chain of lakes and ponds, and, perhaps
for the sake of pictorial unity, converts the second (if a second then
existed) and third lakes into a river.

The Abbey, which, at the dissolution of monasteries in 1539, was handed
over by Henry VIII. to Sir John Byron, "steward and warden of the forest
of Shirewood," was converted, here and there, more or less, into a
baronial "mansion" (stanza lxvi.). It is, roughly speaking, a square
block of buildings, flanking the sides of a grassy quadrangle.
Surrounding the quadrangle are two-storied cloisters, and in the centre
a "Gothic fountain" (stanza lxv. line 1) of composite workmanship. The
upper portion of the stonework is hexagonal, and is ornamented with a
double row of gargoyles (all "monsters" and no "saints," recalling,
perhaps identical with, the "seven deadly sins" gargoyles, still _in
situ_ in the quadrangle of Magdalen College, Oxford); the lower half,
which belongs to the seventeenth or eighteenth century, is hollowed into
niches of a Roman or classical design. (In Byron's time the fountain
stood in a courtyard in front of the Abbey, but before he composed this
canto it had been restored by Colonel Wildman to its original place
within the quadrangle. Byron was acquainted with the change, and writes
accordingly.) When the Byrons took possession of the Abbey the upper
stories of the cloisters were converted, on three sides of the
quadrangle, into galleries, and on the fourth, the north side, into a
library. Abutting on the cloisters are the monastic buildings proper, in
part transformed, but with "much of the monastic" preserved. On the
west, the front of the Abbey, the ground floor consists of the entrance
hall and Monks' Parlour, and, above, the Guests' Refectory or
Banqueting-hall, and the Prior's Parlour. On the south, the Xenodochium
or Guesten Hall, and, above, the Monks' Refectory, or Grand
Drawing-room; on the south and east, on the ground floor, the Prior's
Lodgings, the Chapter House ("the exquisite small chapel," stanza lxvi.
line 5), the "slype" or passage between church and Chapter House; and in
the upper story, the state bedrooms, named after the kings, Edward III.,
Henry VII., etc., who, by the terms of the grant of land to the Prior
and Canons, were entitled to free quarters in the Abbey. During Byron's
brief tenure of Newstead, and for long years before, these "huge halls,
long galleries, and spacious chambers" (stanza lxxvii. line 1) were half
dismantled, and in a more or less ruinous condition. A few pictures
remained on the walls of the Great Drawing-room, of the Prior's Parlour,
and in the apartments of the south-east wing or annexe, which dates from
the seventeenth century (see the account of a visit to Newstead in 1812,
in _Beauties of England and Wales_, 1813, xii. 401-405). There are and
were portraits, by Lely (stanza lxviii. line 7), of a Lady Byron, of
Fanny Jennings, Duchess of Tyrconnel, "loveliness personified," of Mrs.
Hughes, and of Nell Gwynne; by Sir Godfrey Kneller, of William and Mary;
by unnamed artists, of George I. and George II.; and by Ramsay, of
George III. There are portraits of a fat Prior, William Sandall, with a
jewelled reliquary; of "Sir John the Little with the Great Beard," who
ruled in the Prior's stead; and there is the portrait, a votive tablet
of penitence and remorse, "of that Lord Arundel Who struck in heat the
child he loved so well" (see "A Picture at Newstead," by Matthew Arnold,
_Poetical Works_, 1890, p. 177); but of portraits of judges or bishops,
or of pictures by old masters, there is neither trace nor record.

But the characteristic feature of Newstead Abbey, so familiar that
description seems unnecessary, and, yet, never quite accurately
described, is the west front of the Priory Church, which is in line with
the west front of the Abbey. "Half apart," the southern portion of this
front, which abuts on the windows of the Prior's Parlour, and the room
above, where Byron slept, flanks and conceals the west end of the north
cloisters and library; but, with this exception, it is a screen, and
nothing more. In the centre is the "mighty window" (stanza lxii. line
1), shorn of glass and tracery; above are six lancet windows (which
Byron seems to have regarded as niches), and, above again, in a "higher
niche" (stanza lxi. line 1), is the crowned Virgin with the Babe in her
arms, which escaped, as by a miracle, the "fiery darts"--the shot and
cannon-balls of the Cromwellian troopers. On either side of the central
window are "two blank windows containing tracery ['geometrical
decorated'] ... carved [in relief] on the solid ashlar;" on either side
of the window, and at the northern and southern extremities of the
front, are buttresses with canopied niches, in each of which a saint or
apostle must once have stood. Over the west door there is the mutilated
figure of (?) the Saviour, but of twelve saints or twelve niches there
is no trace. The "grand arch" is an ivy-clad screen, and nothing more.
Behind and beyond, in place of vanished nave, of aisle and transept, is
the smooth green turf; and at the east end, on the site of the high
altar, stands the urn-crowned masonry of Boatswain's tomb.

Newstead Abbey was sold by Lord Byron to his old schoolfellow, Colonel
Thomas Wildman, in November, 1817. The house and property were resold in
1861, by his widow, to William Frederick Webb, Esq., a traveller in many
lands, the friend and host of David Livingstone. At his death the estate
was inherited by his daughter, Miss Geraldine Webb, who was married to
General Sir Herbert Charles Chermside, G.C.M.G., etc., Governor of
Queensland, in 1899.

{497}[669] [The woodlands were sacrificed to the needs or fancies of
Byron's great-uncle, the "wicked Lord." One splendid oak, known as the
"Pilgrim's Oak," which stood and stands near the north lodge of the
park, near the "Hut," was bought in by the neighbouring gentry, and made
over to the estate. Perhaps by the Druid oak Byron meant to celebrate
this "last of the clan," which, in his day, before the woods were
replanted, must have stood out in solitary grandeur.]

[671] [The little wood which Byron planted at the south-east corner of
the upper or "Stable" Lake, known as "Poet's Corner," still slopes to

three lakes is specially reserved as a breeding-place.]

by some natural or accidental cause, but it was a strange sound, and
unlike any other I have ever heard (and I have heard many above and
below the surface of the earth produced in ruins, etc., etc., or
caverns).--[MS.]

difficult to believe that the "huge arch" can act as an Æolian harp.

foundations, is tunnelled by a coal-drift.]

celebrities, under a more or less transparent disguise. A few of these

Brougham (vide ante, the suppressed stanzas, Canto I. pp. 67-69). It is
possible that this stanza was written after the Canto as a whole was
finished. But, if not, an incident which took place in the House of
Commons, April 17, 1823, during a debate on Catholic Emancipation, may
be quoted in corroboration of Brougham's unreadiness with regard to the
point of honour. In the course of his speech he accused Canning of
"monstrous truckling for the purpose of obtaining office," and Canning,
without waiting for Brougham to finish, gave him the lie: "I rise to say
that that is false" (_Parl. Deb._, N.S. vol. 8, p. 1091).

There was a "scene," which ended in an exchange of explanations and
quasi-apologies, and henceforth, as a rule, parliamentary insults were
given and received without recourse to duelling. Byron was not aware
that the "old order" had passed or was passing. Compare Hazlitt, in _The
Spirit of the Age_, 1825, pp. 302, 303: "He [Brougham] is adventurous,
but easily panic-struck, and sacrifices the vanity of self-opinion to
the necessity of self-preservation ... himself the first to get out of
harm's way and escape from the danger;" and Mr. Parthenopex Puff (W.
Stewart Rose), in _Vivian Grey_ (1826, i. 186, 187), "Oh! he's a
prodigious fellow! What do you think Booby says? he says, that Foaming
Fudge [Brougham] can do more than any man in Great Britain; that he had
one day to plead in the King's Bench, spout at a tavern, speak in the
House, and fight a duel--and that he found time for everything but the
_last_."]

[688] [In his Journal for December 5, 1813, Byron writes: "The Duke

1898, ii. 361). Possibly the earlier "Duke of Dash" was William Spencer,
sixth Duke of Devonshire, an old schoolfellow of Byron's, who was eager
to renew the acquaintance (_Letters_, 1899, iii. 98, note 2); and, if
so, he may be reckoned as one of the guests of "Norman Abbey."]

{507}[689] [Gronow (_Reminiscences_, 1889, i. 234-240) identifies the
_Chevalier de la Ruse_ with Casimir Comte de Montrond (1768-1843),
back-stairs diplomatist, wit, gambler, and man of fashion. He was the
lifelong companion, if not friend, of Talleyrand, who pleaded for him:
"Qui est-ce qui ne l'aimerait pas, il est si vicieux!" At one time in
the pay of Napoleon, he fell under his displeasure, and, to avoid
arrest, spent two years of exile (1812-14) in England. "He was not,"
says Gronow, "a great talker, nor did he swagger ... or laugh at his own
_bons-mots_. He was demure, sleek, sly, and dangerous.... In the London
clubs he went by the name of Old French." He was a constant guest of the
Duke of York's at Oatlands, "and won much at his whist-table" (_English
Whist_, by W.P. Courtney, 1894, p. 181). For his second residence in
England, and for a sketch by D'Orsay, see _A Portion of the Journal,
etc._, by Thomas Raikes, 1857, frontispiece to vol. iv., _et_ vols.

{508}[691] [Possibly Colonel (afterwards Sir James) Macdonell [d. 1857],
"a man of colossal stature," who occupied and defended the Château of
Hougoumont on the night before the battle of Waterloo. (See Gronow,
_Reminiscences_, 1889, i. 76, 77.)]

[692] [Sir George Prevost (1767-1816), the Governor-General of British
North America, and nominally Commander-in-chief of the Army in the
second American War, contributed, by his excess of caution, supineness,
and delay, to the humiliation of the British forces. The particular
allusion is to his alleged inaction at a critical moment in the
engagement of September 11, 1814, between Commodore Macdonough and
Captain Downie in Plattsburg Bay. "A letter was sent to Capt. Downie,
strongly urging him to come on, as the army had long been waiting for
his co-operation.... The brave Downie replied that he required no urging
to do his duty.... He was as good as his word. The guns were scaled when
he got under way, upon hearing which Sir George issued an _order_ for
the troops to _cook_, instead of _that of instant co-operation_."--To

[693] [George Hardinge (1744-1816), who was returned M.P. for Old Sarum
in 1784, was appointed, in 1787, Senior Justice of the Counties of
Brecon, Glamorgan, and Radnor. According to the _Gentleman's Magazine_,
1816 (vol. lxxxvi. p. 563), "In conversation he had few equals.... He
delighted in pleasantries, and always afforded to his auditors abundance
of mirth and entertainment as well as information." Byron seems to have
supposed that these "pleasantries" found their way into his addresses to
condemned prisoners, but if the charges printed in his _Miscellaneous
Works_, edited by John Nichols in 1818, are reported in full, he was
entirely mistaken. They are tedious, but the "waggery" is conspicuous by
its absence.]

[694] [John Philpot Curran (1750-1817). "Did you know Curran?" asked
Byron of Lady Blessington (_Conversations_, 1834, p. 176); "he was the
most wonderful person I ever saw. In him was combined an imagination the
most brilliant and profound, with a flexibility and wit that would have
justified the observation applied to----that his heart was in his
head." (See, too, _Detached Thoughts_, No. 24, _Letters_, 1901, v.
421.)]

contrasts "the impassioned appeals and flashes of wit of a Curran ...
the golden tide of wisdom, eloquence, and fancy of a Burke," with the
"dashing and graceful manner" which concealed the poverty and "deadness"
of the matter of Erskine's speeches.]

[701] It would have taught him humanity at least. This sentimental
savage, whom it is a mode to quote (amongst the novelists) to show their
sympathy for innocent sports and old songs, teaches how to sew up frogs,
and break their legs by way of experiment, in addition to the art of
angling,--the cruelest, the coldest, and the stupidest of pretended
sports. They may talk about the beauties of nature, but the angler
merely thinks of his dish of fish; he has no leisure to take his eyes
from off the streams, and a single _bite_ is worth to him more than all
the scenery around. Besides, some fish bite best on a rainy day. The
whale, the shark, and the tunny fishery have somewhat of noble and
perilous in them; even net fishing, trawling, etc., are more humane and
useful. But angling!--no angler can be a good man.

"One of the best men I ever knew,--as humane, delicate-minded, generous,
and excellent a creature as any in the world,--was an angler: true, he
angled with painted flies, and would have been incapable of the
extravagancies of I. Walton."

                      I.

    IF from great Nature's or our own abyss[703]
      Of Thought we could but snatch a certainty,
    Perhaps Mankind might find the path they miss--
      But then 't would spoil much good philosophy.
    One system eats another up, and this[704]
      Much as old Saturn ate his progeny;
    For when his pious consort gave him stones
    In lieu of sons, of these he made no bones.

                      II.

    But System doth reverse the Titan's breakfast,
      And eats her parents, albeit the digestion
    Is difficult. Pray tell me, can you make fast,
      After due search, your faith to any question?
    Look back o'er ages, ere unto the stake fast
      You bind yourself, and call some mode the best one.
    Nothing more true than _not_ to trust your senses;
    And yet what are your other evidences?

                      III.

    For me, I know nought; nothing I deny,
      Admit--reject--contemn: and what know _you_,
    Except perhaps that you were born to die?
      And both may after all turn out untrue.
    An age may come, Font of Eternity,
      When nothing shall be either old or new.
    Death, so called, is a thing which makes men weep,
    And yet a third of Life is passed in sleep.

                      IV.

    A sleep without dreams, after a rough day
      Of toil, is what we covet most; and yet
    How clay shrinks back from more quiescent clay!
      The very Suicide that pays his debt
    At once without instalments (an old way
      Of paying debts, which creditors regret),
    Lets out impatiently his rushing breath,
    Less from disgust of Life than dread of Death.

                      V.

    'T is round him--near him--here--there--everywhere--
      And there's a courage which grows out of fear,
    Perhaps of all most desperate, which will dare
      The worst to _know_ it:--when the mountains rear
    Their peaks beneath your human foot, and there
      You look down o'er the precipice, and drear
    The gulf of rock yawns,--you can't gaze a minute,
    Without an awful wish to plunge within it.

                      VI.

    'T is true, you don't--but, pale and struck with terror,
      Retire: but look into your past impression!
    And you will find, though shuddering at the mirror
      Of your own thoughts, in all their self-confession,
    The lurking bias,[705] be it truth or error,
      To the _unknown_; a secret prepossession,
    To plunge with all your fears--but where? You know not,
    And that's the reason why you do--or do not.

                      VII.

    But what's this to the purpose? you will say.
      Gent. reader, nothing; a mere speculation,
    For which my sole excuse is--'t is my way;
      Sometimes _with_ and sometimes without occasion,
    I write what's uppermost, without delay;
      This narrative is not meant for narration,
    But a mere airy and fantastic basis,
    To build up common things with common places.

                      VIII.

    You know, or don't know, that great Bacon saith,
      "Fling up a straw, 't will show the way the wind blows;"[706]
    And such a straw, borne on by human breath,
      Is Poesy, according as the Mind glows;
    A paper kite which flies 'twixt Life and Death,
      A shadow which the onward Soul behind throws:
    And mine's a bubble, not blown up for praise,
    But just to play with, as an infant plays.

                      IX.

    The World is all before me[707]--or behind;
      For I have seen a portion of that same,
    And quite enough for me to keep in mind;--
      Of passions, too, I have proved enough to blame,
    To the great pleasure of our friends, Mankind,
      Who like to mix some slight alloy with fame;
    For I was rather famous in my time,
    Until I fairly knocked it up with rhyme.

                      X.

    I have brought this world about my ears, and eke
      The other; that's to say, the Clergy--who
    Upon my head have bid their thunders break
      In pious libels by no means a few.
    And yet I can't help scribbling once a week,
      Tiring old readers, nor discovering new.
    In Youth I wrote because my mind was full,
    And _now_ because I feel it growing dull.

                      XI.

    But "why then publish?"[708]--There are no rewards
      Of fame or profit when the World grows weary.
    I ask in turn,--Why do you play at cards?
      Why drink? Why read?--To make some hour less dreary.
    It occupies me to turn back regards
      On what I've seen or pondered, sad or cheery;
    And what I write I cast upon the stream,
    To swim or sink--I have had at least my dream.

                      XII.

    I think that were I _certain_ of success,
      I hardly could compose another line:
    So long I've battled either more or less,
      That no defeat can drive me from the Nine.
    This feeling 't is not easy to express,
      And yet 't is not affected, I opine.
    In play, there are two pleasures for your choosing--
    The one is winning, and the other losing.

                      XIII.

    Besides, my Muse by no means deals in fiction:
      She gathers a repertory of facts,
    Of course with some reserve and slight restriction,
      But mostly sings of human things and acts--
    And that's one cause she meets with contradiction;
      For too much truth, at first sight, ne'er attracts;
    And were her object only what's called Glory,
    With more ease too she'd tell a different story.

                      XIV.

    Love--War--a tempest--surely there's variety;
      Also a seasoning slight of lucubration;
    A bird's-eye view, too, of that wild, Society;
      A slight glance thrown on men of every station.
    If you have nought else, here's at least satiety,
      Both in performance and in preparation;
    And though these lines should only line portmanteaus,
    Trade will be all the better for these Cantos.

                      XV.

    The portion of this World which I at present
      Have taken up to fill the following sermon,
    Is one of which there's no description recent:
      The reason why is easy to determine:
    Although it seems both prominent and pleasant,
      There is a sameness in its gems and ermine,
    A dull and family likeness through all ages,
    Of no great promise for poetic pages.

                      XVI.

    With much to excite, there's little to exalt;
      Nothing that speaks to all men and all times;
    A sort of varnish over every fault;
      A kind of common-place, even in their crimes;
    Factitious passions--Wit without much salt--
      A want of that true nature which sublimes
    Whate'er it shows with Truth; a smooth monotony
    Of character, in those at least who have got any.

                      XVII.

    Sometimes, indeed, like soldiers off parade,
      They break their ranks and gladly leave the drill;
    But then the roll-call draws them back afraid,
      And they must be or seem what they _were_: still
    Doubtless it is a brilliant masquerade:
      But when of the first sight you have had your fill,
    It palls--at least it did so upon me,
    This paradise of Pleasure and _Ennui_.

                      XVIII.

    When we have made our love, and gamed our gaming,
      Dressed, voted, shone, and, may be, something more--
    With dandies dined--heard senators declaiming--
      Seen beauties brought to market by the score,
    Sad rakes to sadder husbands chastely taming--
      There's little left but to be bored or bore.
    Witness those _ci-devant jeunes hommes_ who stem
    The stream, nor leave the world which leaveth them.

                      XIX.

    'T is said--indeed a general complaint--
      That no one has succeeded in describing
    The _monde_, exactly as they ought to paint:
      Some say, that authors only snatch, by bribing
    The porter, some slight scandals strange and quaint,
      To furnish matter for their moral gibing;
    And that their books have but one style in common--
    My Lady's prattle, filtered through her woman.

                      XX.

    But this can't well be true, just now; for writers
      Are grown of the _beau monde_ a part potential:
    I've seen them balance even the scale with fighters,
      Especially when young, for that's essential.
    Why do their sketches fail them as inditers
      Of what they deem themselves most consequential,
    The _real_ portrait of the highest tribe?
    'T is that--in fact--there's little to describe.

                      XXI.

    _"Haud ignara loquor;"_[709] these are _Nugae_, "_quarum
      Pars_ parva _fui_," but still art and part.
    Now I could much more easily sketch a harem,
      A battle, wreck, or history of the heart,
    Than these things; and besides, I wish to spare 'em,
      For reasons which I choose to keep apart.
    _"Vetabo Cereris sacrum qui vulgarit"_--[710]
    Which means, that vulgar people must not share it.

                      XXII.

    And therefore what I throw off is ideal--
      Lowered, leavened, like a history of Freemasons,
    Which bears the same relation to the real,
      As Captain Parry's Voyage may do to Jason's.
    The grand _Arcanum_'s not for men to see all;
      My music has some mystic diapasons;
    And there is much which could not be appreciated
    In any manner by the uninitiated.

                      XXIII.

    Alas! worlds fall--and Woman, since she felled
      The World (as, since that history, less polite
    Than true, hath been a creed so strictly held),
      Has not yet given up the practice quite.
    Poor Thing of Usages! coerced, compelled,
      Victim when wrong, and martyr oft when right,
    Condemned to child-bed, as men for their sins
    Have shaving too entailed upon their chins,--

                      XXIV.

    A daily plague, which in the aggregate
      May average on the whole with parturition.--
    But as to women--who can penetrate
      The real sufferings of their she condition?
    Man's very sympathy with their estate
      Has much of selfishness, and more suspicion.
    Their love, their virtue, beauty, education,
    But form good housekeepers--to breed a nation.

                      XXV.

    All this were very well, and can't be better;
      But even this is difficult, Heaven knows,
    So many troubles from her birth beset her,
      Such small distinction between friends and foes;
    The gilding wears so soon from off her fetter,
      That--but ask any woman if she'd choose
    (Take her at thirty, that is) to have been
    Female or male? a schoolboy or a Queen?

                      XXVI.

    "Petticoat Influence" is a great reproach,
      Which even those who obey would fain be thought
    To fly from, as from hungry pikes a roach;
      But since beneath it upon earth we are brought,
    By various joltings of Life's hackney coach,
      I for one venerate a petticoat--
    A garment of a mystical sublimity,
    No matter whether russet, silk, or dimity.[mv]

                      XXVII.

    Much I respect, and much I have adored,
      In my young days, that chaste and goodly veil,
    Which holds a treasure, like a miser's hoard,
      And more attracts by all it doth conceal--
    A golden scabbard on a Damasque sword,
      A loving letter with a mystic seal,
    A cure for grief--for what can ever rankle
    Before a petticoat and peeping ankle?

                      XXVIII.

    And when upon a silent, sullen day,
      With a Sirocco, for example, blowing,
    When even the sea looks dim with all its spray,
      And sulkily the river's ripple's flowing,
    And the sky shows that very ancient gray,
      The sober, sad antithesis to glowing,--
    'T is pleasant, if _then_ anything is pleasant,
    To catch a glimpse even of a pretty peasant.

                      XXIX.

    We left our heroes and our heroines
      In that fair clime which don't depend on climate,
    Quite independent of the Zodiac's signs,
      Though certainly more difficult to rhyme at,
    Because the Sun, and stars, and aught that shines,
      Mountains, and all we can be most sublime at,
    Are there oft dull and dreary as a _dun_--
    Whether a sky's or tradesman's is all one.

                      XXX.

    An in-door life is less poetical;
      And out-of-door hath showers, and mists, and sleet
    With which I could not brew a pastoral:
      But be it as it may, a bard must meet
    All difficulties, whether great or small,
      To spoil his undertaking, or complete--
    And work away--like Spirit upon Matter--
    Embarrassed somewhat both with fire and water.

                      XXXI.

    Juan--in this respect, at least, like saints--
      Was all things unto people of all sorts,
    And lived contentedly, without complaints,
      In camps, in ships, in cottages, or courts--
    Born with that happy soul which seldom faints,
      And mingling modestly in toils or sports.
    He likewise could be most things to all women,
    Without the coxcombry of certain _she_ men.

                      XXXII.

    A fox-hunt to a foreigner is strange;
      'T is also subject to the double danger
    Of tumbling first, and having in exchange
      Some pleasant jesting at the awkward stranger:
    But Juan had been early taught to range
      The wilds, as doth an Arab turned avenger,
    So that his horse, or charger, hunter, hack,
    Knew that he had a rider on his back.

                      XXXIII.

    And now in this new field, with some applause,
      He cleared hedge, ditch, and double post, and rail,
    And never _craned_[711] and made but few _"faux pas,"_
      And only fretted when the scent 'gan fail.
    He broke, 't is true, some statutes of the laws
      Of hunting--for the sagest youth is frail;
    Rode o'er the hounds, it may be, now and then,
    And once o'er several Country Gentlemen.

                      XXXIV.

    But on the whole, to general admiration,
      He acquitted both himself and horse: the Squires
    Marvelled at merit of another nation;
      The boors cried "Dang it! who'd have thought it?"--Sires,
    The Nestors of the sporting generation,
      Swore praises, and recalled their former fires;
    The Huntsman's self relented to a grin,
    And rated him almost a whipper-in.[mw]

                      XXXV.

    Such were his trophies--not of spear and shield,
      But leaps, and bursts, and sometimes foxes' brushes;
    Yet I must own,--although in this I yield
      To patriot sympathy a Briton's blushes,--
    He thought at heart like courtly Chesterfield,
      Who, after a long chase o'er hills, dales, bushes,
    And what not, though he rode beyond all price.
    Asked next day, "If men ever hunted _twice_?"[mx][712]

                      XXXVI.

    He also had a quality uncommon
      To early risers after a long chase,
    Who wake in winter ere the cock can summon
      December's drowsy day to his dull race,--
    A quality agreeable to Woman,
      When her soft, liquid words run on apace,
    Who likes a listener, whether Saint or Sinner,--
    He did not fall asleep just after dinner;

                      XXXVII.

    But, light and airy, stood on the alert,
      And shone in the best part of dialogue,
    By humouring always what they might assert,
      And listening to the topics most in vogue,
    Now grave, now gay, but never dull or pert;
      And smiling but in secret--cunning rogue!
    He ne'er presumed to make an error clearer;--
    In short, there never was a better hearer.

                      XXXVIII.

    And then he danced;--all foreigners excel
      The serious Angles in the eloquence
    Of pantomime!--he danced, I say, right well,
      With emphasis, and also with good sense--
    A thing in footing indispensable;
      He danced without theatrical pretence,
    Not like a ballet-master in the van
    Of his drilled nymphs, but like a gentleman.

                      XXXIX.

    Chaste were his steps, each kept within due bound,
      And Elegance was sprinkled o'er his figure;
    Like swift Camilla, he scarce skimmed the ground,[713]
      And rather held in than put forth his vigour;
    And then he had an ear for Music's sound,
      Which might defy a crotchet critic's rigour.
    Such classic _pas_--sans flaws--set off our hero,
    He glanced like a personified Bolero;[714]

                      XL.

    Or like a flying Hour before Aurora,
      In Guido's famous fresco[715] (which alone
    Is worth a tour to Rome, although no more a
      Remnant were there of the old World's sole throne):
    The "_tout ensemble_" of his movements wore a
      Grace of the soft Ideal, seldom shown,
    And ne'er to be described; for to the dolour
    Of bards and prosers, words are void of colour.

                      XLI.

    No marvel then he was a favourite;
      A full-grown Cupid,[716] very much admired;
    A little spoilt, but by no means so quite;
      At least he kept his vanity retired.
    Such was his tact, he could alike delight
      The chaste, and those who are not so much inspired.
    The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke, who loved _tracasserie_,
    Began to treat him with some small _agacerie_.

                      XLII.

    She was a fine and somewhat full-blown blonde,
      Desirable, distinguished, celebrated
    For several winters in the grand, _grand Monde_:
      I'd rather not say what might be related
    Of her exploits, for this were ticklish ground;
      Besides there might be falsehood in what's stated:
    Her late performance had been a dead set
    At Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.

                      XLIII.

    This noble personage began to look
      A little black upon this new flirtation;
    But such small licences must lovers brook,
      Mere freedoms of the female corporation.
    Woe to the man who ventures a rebuke!
      'Twill but precipitate a situation
    Extremely disagreeable, but common
    To calculators when they count on Woman.

                      XLIV.

    The circle smiled, then whispered, and then sneered;
      The misses bridled, and the matrons frowned;
    Some hoped things might not turn out as they feared;
      Some would not deem such women could be found;
    Some ne'er believed one half of what they heard;
      Some looked perplexed, and others looked profound:
    And several pitied with sincere regret
    Poor Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.

                      XLV.

    But what is odd, none ever named the Duke,
      Who, one might think, was something in the affair:
    True, he was absent, and, 'twas rumoured, took
      But small concern about the when, or where,
    Or what his consort did: if he could brook
      Her gaieties, none had a right to stare:
    Theirs was that best of unions, past all doubt,
    Which never meets, and therefore can't fall out.

                      XLVI.

    But, oh! that I should ever pen so sad a line!
      Fired with an abstract love of Virtue, she,
    My Dian of the Ephesians, Lady Adeline,
      Began to think the Duchess' conduct free;
    Regretting much that she had chosen so bad a line,
      And waxing chiller in her courtesy,
    Looked grave and pale to see her friend's fragility,
    For which most friends reserve their sensibility.

                      XLVII.

    There's nought in this bad world like sympathy:
      'Tis so becoming to the soul and face,
    Sets to soft music the harmonious sigh,
      And robes sweet Friendship in a Brussels lace.
    Without a friend, what were Humanity,
      To hunt our errors up with a good grace?
    Consoling us with--"Would you had thought twice!
    Ah! if you had but followed my advice!"

                      XLVIII.

    O Job! you had two friends: one's quite enough,
      Especially when we are ill at ease;
    They're but bad pilots when the weather's rough,
      Doctors less famous for their cures than fees.
    Let no man grumble when his friends fall off,
      As they will do like leaves at the first breeze:
    When your affairs come round, one way or t' other,
    Go to the coffee-house, and take another.[717]

                      XLIX.

    But this is not my maxim: had it been,
      Some heart-aches had been spared me: yet I care not--
    I would not be a tortoise in his screen
      Of stubborn shell, which waves and weather wear not:
    'Tis better on the whole to have felt and seen
      That which Humanity may bear, or bear not:
    'Twill teach discernment to the sensitive,
    And not to pour their Ocean in a sieve.

                      L.

    Of all the horrid, hideous notes of woe,
      Sadder than owl-songs or the midnight blast,
    Is that portentous phrase, "I told you so,"
      Uttered by friends, those prophets of the _past_,
    Who, 'stead of saying what you _now_ should do,
      Own they foresaw that you would fall at last,[my]
    And solace your slight lapse 'gainst _bonos mores_,
    With a long memorandum of old stories.

                      LI.

    The Lady Adeline's serene severity
      Was not confined to feeling for her friend,
    Whose fame she rather doubted with posterity,
      Unless her habits should begin to mend:
    But Juan also shared in her austerity,
      But mixed with pity, pure as e'er was penned
    His Inexperience moved her gentle ruth,
    And (as her junior by six weeks) his Youth.

                      LII.

    These forty days' advantage of her years--
      And hers were those which can face calculation,
    Boldly referring to the list of Peers
      And noble births, nor dread the enumeration--
    Gave her a right to have maternal fears
      For a young gentleman's fit education,
    Though she was far from that leap year, whose leap,
    In female dates, strikes Time all of a heap.

                      LIII.

    This may be fixed at somewhere before thirty--
      Say seven-and-twenty; for I never knew
    The strictest in chronology and virtue
      Advance beyond, while they could pass for new.
    O Time! why dost not pause? Thy scythe, so dirty
      With rust, should surely cease to hack and hew:
    Reset it--shave more smoothly, also slower,
    If but to keep thy credit as a mower.

                      LIV.

    But Adeline was far from that ripe age,
      Whose ripeness is but bitter at the best:
    'Twas rather her Experience made her sage,
      For she had seen the World and stood its test,
    As I have said in--I forget what page;
      My Muse despises reference, as you have guessed
    By this time;--but strike six from seven-and-twenty,
    And you will find her sum of years in plenty.

                      LV.

    At sixteen she came out; presented, vaunted,
      She put all coronets into commotion:
    At seventeen, too, the World was still enchanted
      With the new Venus of their brilliant Ocean:
    At eighteen, though below her feet still panted
      A Hecatomb of suitors with devotion,
    She had consented to create again
    That Adam, called "The happiest of Men."

                      LVI.

    Since then she had sparkled through three glowing winters,
      Admired, adored; but also so correct,
    That she had puzzled all the acutest hinters,
      Without the apparel of being circumspect:
    They could not even glean the slightest splinters
      From off the marble, which had no defect.
    She had also snatched a moment since her marriage
    To bear a son and heir--and one miscarriage.

                      LVII.

    Fondly the wheeling fire-flies flew around her,
      Those little glitterers of the London night;
    But none of these possessed a sting to wound her--
      She was a pitch beyond a coxcomb's flight.
    Perhaps she wished an aspirant profounder;
      But whatsoe'er she wished, she acted right;
    And whether Coldness, Pride, or Virtue dignify
    A Woman--so she's good--what _does_ it signify?

                      LVIII.

    I hate a motive, like a lingering bottle
      Which with the landlord makes too long a stand,
    Leaving all-claretless the unmoistened throttle,
      Especially with politics on hand;
    I hate it, as I hate a drove of cattle,
      Who whirl the dust as Simooms whirl the sand;
    I hate it as I hate an argument,
    A Laureate's Ode, or servile Peer's "Content."

                      LIX.

    'T is sad to hack into the roots of things,
      They are so much intertwisted with the earth;
    So that the branch a goodly verdure flings,
      I reck not if an acorn gave it birth.
    To trace all actions to their secret springs
      Would make indeed some melancholy mirth:
    But this is not at present my concern,
    And I refer you to wise Oxenstiern.[718]

                      LX.

    With the kind view of saving an _éclat_,
      Both to the Duchess and Diplomatist,
    The Lady Adeline, as soon's she saw
      That Juan was unlikely to resist--
    (For foreigners don't know that a _faux pas_
      In England ranks quite on a different list
    From those of other lands unblest with juries,
    Whose verdict for such sin a certain cure is;--)[mz]

                      LXI.

    The Lady Adeline resolved to take
      Such measures as she thought might best impede
    The farther progress of this sad mistake.
      She thought with some simplicity indeed;
    But Innocence is bold even at the stake,
      And simple in the World, and doth not need
    Nor use those palisades by dames erected,
    Whose virtue lies in never being detected.

                      LXII.

    It was not that she feared the very worst:
      His Grace was an enduring, married man,
    And was not likely all at once to burst
      Into a scene, and swell the clients' clan
    Of Doctors' Commons; but she dreaded first
      The magic of her Grace's talisman,
    And next a quarrel (as he seemed to fret)
    With Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.

                      LXIII.

    Her Grace, too, passed for being an _intrigante_,
      And somewhat _méchante_ in her amorous sphere;
    One of those pretty, precious plagues, which haunt
      A lover with caprices soft and dear,
    That like to _make_ a quarrel, when they can't
      Find one, each day of the delightful year:
    Bewitching, torturing, as they freeze or glow,
    And--what is worst of all--won't let you go:

                      LXIV.

    The sort of thing to turn a young man's head,
      Or make a Werter of him in the end.
    No wonder then a purer soul should dread
      This sort of chaste _liaison_ for a friend;
    It were much better to be wed or dead,
      Than wear a heart a Woman loves to rend.
    'T is best to pause, and think, ere you rush on,
    If that a _bonne fortune_ be really _bonne_.

                      LXV.

    And first, in the overflowing of her heart,
      Which really knew or thought it knew no guile,
    She called her husband now and then apart,
      And bade him counsel Juan. With a smile
    Lord Henry heard her plans of artless art
      To wean Don Juan from the Siren's wile;
    And answered, like a statesman or a prophet,
    In such guise that she could make nothing of it.

                      LXVI.

    Firstly, he said, "he never interfered
      In anybody's business but the King's:"
    Next, that "he never judged from what appeared,
      Without strong reason, of those sort of things:"
    Thirdly, that "Juan had more brain than beard,
      And was not to be held in leading strings;"
    And fourthly, what need hardly be said twice,
    "That good but rarely came from good advice."

                      LXVII.

    And, therefore, doubtless to approve the truth
      Of the last axiom, he advised his spouse
    To leave the parties to themselves, forsooth--
      At least as far as _bienséance_ allows:[na]
    That time would temper Juan's faults of youth;
      That young men rarely made monastic vows;
    That Opposition only more attaches--
    But here a messenger brought in despatches:

                      LXVIII.

    And being of the council called "the Privy,"
      Lord Henry walked into his cabinet,
    To furnish matter for some future Livy
      To tell how he reduced the Nation's debt;
    And if their full contents I do not give ye,
      It is because I do not know them yet;
    But I shall add them in a brief appendix,
    To come between mine Epic and its index.

                      LXIX.

    But ere he went, he added a slight hint,
      Another gentle common-place or two,
    Such as are coined in Conversation's mint,
      And pass, for want of better, though not new:
    Then broke his packet, to see what was in 't,
      And having casually glanced it through,
    Retired: and, as he went out, calmly kissed her,
    Less like a young wife than an agéd sister.

                      LXX.

    He was a cold, good, honourable man,
      Proud of his birth, and proud of everything;
    A goodly spirit for a state Divan,
      A figure fit to walk before a King;
    Tall, stately, formed to lead the courtly van
      On birthdays, glorious with a star and string;
    The very model of a chamberlain--
    And such I mean to make him when I reign.

                      LXXI.

    But there was something wanting on the whole--
      I don't know what, and therefore cannot tell--
    Which pretty women--the sweet souls!--call _soul_.
      _Certes_ it was not body; he was well
    Proportioned, as a poplar or a pole,
      A handsome man, that human miracle;
    And in each circumstance of Love or War
    Had still preserved his perpendicular.

                      LXXII.

    Still there was something wanting, as I've said--
      That undefinable "_Je ne sçais quoi_"
    Which, for what I know, may of yore have led
      To Homer's Iliad, since it drew to Troy
    The Greek Eve, Helen, from the Spartan's bed;
      Though on the whole, no doubt, the Dardan boy
    Was much inferior to King Menelaüs:--
    But thus it is some women will betray us.

                      LXXIII.

    There is an awkward thing which much perplexes,
      Unless like wise Tiresias[719] we had proved
    By turns the difference of the several sexes;
      Neither can show quite _how_ they would be loved.
    The Sensual for a short time but connects us--
      The Sentimental boasts to be unmoved;
    But both together form a kind of Centaur,
    Upon whose back 't is better not to venture.

                      LXXIV.

    A something all-sufficient for the _heart_
      Is that for which the sex are always seeking:
    But how to fill up that same vacant part?
      There lies the rub--and this they are but weak in.
    Frail mariners afloat without a chart,
      They run before the wind through high seas breaking;
    And when they have made the shore through every shock,
    'T is odd--or odds--it may turn out a rock.

                      LXXV.

    There is a flower called "Love in Idleness,"[720]
      For which see Shakespeare's ever-blooming garden;--
    I will not make his great description less,
      And beg his British godship's humble pardon,
    If, in my extremity of rhyme's distress,
      I touch a single leaf where he is warden;--
    But, though the flower is different, with the French
    Or Swiss Rousseau--cry _"Voilà la Pervenche.'"_[721]

                      LXXVI.

    Eureka! I have found it! What I mean
      To say is, not that Love is Idleness,
    But that in Love such idleness has been
      An accessory, as I have cause to guess.
    Hard Labour's an indifferent go-between;
      Your men of business are not apt to express
    Much passion, since the merchant-ship, the Argo,
    Conveyed Medea as her supercargo.

                      LXXVII.

    _"Beatus ille procul!_" from "_negotiis,_"[722]
      Saith Horace; the great little poet's wrong;
    His other maxim, _"Noscitur à sociis,"_[723]
      Is much more to the purpose of his song;
    Though even that were sometimes too ferocious,
      Unless good company be kept too long;
    But, in his teeth, whate'er their state or station,
    Thrice happy they who _have_ an occupation!

                      LXXVIII.

    Adam exchanged his Paradise for ploughing,
      Eve made up millinery with fig leaves--
    The earliest knowledge from the Tree so knowing,
      As far as I know, that the Church receives:
    And since that time it need not cost much showing,
      That many of the ills o'er which Man grieves,
    And still more Women, spring from not employing
    Some hours to make the remnant worth enjoying.

                      LXXIX.

    And hence high life is oft a dreary void,
      A rack of pleasures, where we must invent
    A something wherewithal to be annoyed.
      Bards may sing what they please about _Content_;
    _Contented_, when translated, means but cloyed;
      And hence arise the woes of Sentiment,
    Blue-devils--and Blue-stockings--and Romances
    Reduced to practice, and performed like dances.

                      LXXX.

    I do declare, upon an affidavit,
      Romances I ne'er read like those I have seen;
    Nor, if unto the World I ever gave it,
      Would some believe that such a tale had been:
    But such intent I never had, nor have it;
      Some truths are better kept behind a screen,
    Especially when they would look like lies;
    I therefore deal in generalities.[nb]

                      LXXXI.

    "An oyster may be crossed in love"[724]--and why?
      Because he mopeth idly in his shell,
    And heaves a lonely subterraqueous sigh,
      Much as a monk may do within his cell:
    And _à-propos_ of monks, their Piety
      With Sloth hath found it difficult to dwell:
    Those vegetables of the Catholic creed
    Are apt exceedingly to run to seed.

                      LXXXII.

    O Wilberforce! thou man of black renown,
      Whose merit none enough can sing or say,
    Thou hast struck one immense Colossus down,
      Thou moral Washington of Africa!
    But there's another little thing, I own,
      Which you should perpetrate some summer's day,
    And set the other half of Earth to rights;
    You have freed the _blacks_--now pray shut up the whites.

                      LXXXIII.

    Shut up the bald-coot[725] bully Alexander!
      Ship off the Holy Three to Senegal;
    Teach them that "sauce for goose is sauce for gander,"
      And ask them how _they_ like to be in thrall?
    Shut up each high heroic Salamander,
      Who eats fire gratis (since the pay's but small);
    Shut up--no, _not_ the King, but the Pavilion,[726]
    Or else 't will cost us all another million.

                      LXXXIV.

    Shut up the World at large, let Bedlam out;
      And you will be perhaps surprised to find
    All things pursue exactly the same route,
      As now with those of _soi-disant_ sound mind.
    This I could prove beyond a single doubt,
      Were there a jot of sense among Mankind;
    But till that _point d'appui_ is found, alas!
    Like Archimedes, I leave Earth as 't was.

                      LXXXV.

    Our gentle Adeline had one defect--
      Her heart was vacant, though a splendid mansion;
    Her conduct had been perfectly correct,
      As she had seen nought claiming its expansion.
    A wavering spirit may be easier wrecked,
      Because 't is frailer, doubtless, than a staunch one;
    But when the latter works its own undoing,
    Its inner crash is like an Earthquake's ruin.

                      LXXXVI.

    She loved her Lord, or thought so; but _that_ love
      Cost her an effort, which is a sad toil,
    The stone of Sisyphus, if once we move
      Our feelings 'gainst the nature of the soil.
    She had nothing to complain of, or reprove,
      No bickerings, no connubial turmoil:
    Their union was a model to behold,
    Serene and noble,--conjugal, but cold.

                      LXXXVII.

    There was no great disparity of years,
      Though much in temper; but they never clashed:
    They moved like stars united in their spheres,
      Or like the Rhone by Leman's waters washed,
    Where mingled and yet separate appears
      The River from the Lake, all bluely dashed
    Through the serene and placid glassy deep,
    Which fain would lull its river-child to sleep.[727]

                      LXXXVIII.

    Now when she once had ta'en an interest
      In anything, however she might flatter
    Herself that her intentions were the best,
      Intense intentions are a dangerous matter:
    Impressions were much stronger than she guessed,
      And gathered as they run like growing water
    Upon her mind; the more so, as her breast
    Was not at first too readily impressed.

                      LXXXIX.

    But when it was, she had that lurking Demon
      Of double nature, and thus doubly named--
    Firmness yclept in Heroes, Kings, and seamen,
      That is, when they succeed; but greatly blamed
    As _Obstinacy_, both in Men and Women,
      Whene'er their triumph pales, or star is tamed:--
    And 't will perplex the casuist in morality
    To fix the due bounds of this dangerous quality.

                      XC.

    Had Buonaparte won at Waterloo,
      It had been firmness; now 't is pertinacity:
    Must the event decide between the two?
      I leave it to your people of sagacity
    To draw the line between the false and true,
      If such can e'er be drawn by Man's capacity:
    My business is with Lady Adeline,
    Who in her way too was a heroine.

                      XCI.

    She knew not her own heart; then how should I?
      I think not she was _then_ in love with Juan:
    If so, she would have had the strength to fly
      The wild sensation, unto her a new one:
    She merely felt a common sympathy
      (I will not say it was a false or true one)
    In him, because she thought he was in danger,--
    Her husband's friend--her own--young--and a stranger.

                      XCII.

    She was, or thought she was, his friend--and this
      Without the farce of Friendship, or romance
    Of Platonism, which leads so oft amiss
      Ladies who have studied Friendship but in France
    Or Germany, where people _purely_ kiss.[nc]
      To thus much Adeline would not advance;
    But of such friendship as Man's may to Man be
    She was as capable as Woman can be.

                      XCIII.

    No doubt the secret influence of the Sex
      Will there, as also in the ties of blood,
    An innocent predominance annex,
      And tune the concord to a finer mood.[nd]
    If free from Passion, which all Friendship checks,
      And your true feelings fully understood,
    No friend like to a woman Earth discovers,
    So that you have not been nor will be lovers.

                      XCIV.

    Love bears within its breast the very germ
      Of Change; and how should this be otherwise?
    That violent things more quickly find a term
      Is shown through Nature's whole analogies;[728]
    And how should the most fierce of all be firm?
      Would you have endless lightning in the skies?
    Methinks Love's very title says enough:
    How should "the _tender_ passion" e'er be _tough?_

                      XCV.

    Alas! by all experience, seldom yet
      (I merely quote what I have heard from many)
    Had lovers not some reason to regret
      The passion which made Solomon a zany.[ne]
    I've also seen some wives (not to forget
      The marriage state, the best or worst of any)
    Who were the very paragons of wives,
    Yet made the misery of at least two lives.[nf]

                      XCVI.

    I've also seen some female _friends_[729] ('t is odd,[ng]
      But true--as, if expedient, I could prove)
    That faithful were through thick and thin, abroad,[nh]
      At home, far more than ever yet was Love--
    Who did not quit me when Oppression trod
      Upon me; whom no scandal could remove;
    Who fought, and fight, in absence, too, my battles,
    Despite the snake Society's loud rattles.

                      XCVII.

    Whether Don Juan and chaste Adeline
      Grew friends in this or any other sense,
    Will be discussed hereafter, I opine:
      At present I am glad of a pretence
    To leave them hovering, as the effect is fine,
      And keeps the atrocious reader in _suspense_;
    The surest way--for ladies and for books--
    To bait their tender--or their tenter--hooks.

                      XCVIII.

    Whether they rode, or walked, or studied Spanish,
      To read Don Quixote in the original,
    A pleasure before which all others vanish;
      Whether their talk was of the kind called "small,"
    Or serious, are the topics I must banish
      To the next Canto; where perhaps I shall
    Say something to the purpose, and display
    Considerable talent in my way.

                      XCIX.

    Above all, I beg all men to forbear
      Anticipating aught about the matter:
    They'll only make mistakes about the fair,
      And Juan, too, especially the latter.
    And I shall take a much more serious air
      Than I have yet done, in this Epic Satire.
    It is not clear that Adeline and Juan
    Will fall; but if they do, 't will be their ruin.

                      C.

    But great things spring from little:--Would you think,
      That in our youth, as dangerous a passion
    As e'er brought Man and Woman to the brink
      Of ruin, rose from such a slight occasion,
    As few would ever dream could form the link
      Of such a sentimental situation?
    You'll never guess, I'll bet you millions, milliards[730]--
    It all sprung from a harmless game at billiards.

                      CI.

    'T is strange,--but true; for Truth is always strange--
      Stranger than fiction: if it could be told,
    How much would novels gain by the exchange!
      How differently the World would men behold!
    How oft would Vice and Virtue places change!
      The new world would be nothing to the old,
    If some Columbus of the moral seas
    Would show mankind their Souls' antipodes.

                      CII.

    What "antres vast and deserts idle,"[731] then,
      Would be discovered in the human soul!
    What icebergs in the hearts of mighty men,
      With self-love in the centre as their Pole!
    What Anthropophagi are nine of ten
      Of those who hold the kingdoms in control!
    Were things but only called by their right name,
    Cæsar himself would be ashamed of Fame.[732]

{528}[717] In Swift's or Horace Walpole's letters I think it is
mentioned that somebody, regretting the loss of a friend, was answered
by an universal Pylades: "When I lose one, I go to the Saint James's
Coffee-house, and take another." I recollect having heard an anecdote of
the same kind.--Sir W.D. was a great gamester. Coming in one day to the
Club of which he was a member, he was observed to look
melancholy.--"What is the matter, Sir William?" cried Hare, of facetious
memory.--"Ah!" replied Sir W., "I have just lost poor Lady D."--"Lost!
What at? Quinze or Hazard?" was the consolatory rejoinder of the
querist.

[The story is that his son John, who had been sent to represent him at
the Congress of Westphalia, 1648, wrote home to complain that the task
was beyond him, and that he could not cope with the difficulties which
he was encountering, and that the Chancellor replied, "Nescis, mi fili,

{535}[719] [Once upon a time, Tiresias, who was shepherding on Mount
Cyllene, wantonly stamped with his heel on a pair of snakes, and was
straightway turned into a woman. Seven years later he was led to treat
another pair of snakes in like fashion, and, happily or otherwise, was
turned back into a man. Hence, when Jupiter and Juno fell to wrangling
on the comparative enjoyments of men and women, the question was
referred to Tiresias, as a person of unusual experience and authority.
He gave it in favour of the woman, and Juno, who was displeased at his
answer, struck him with blindness. But Jupiter, to make amends, gave him
the "liberty of prophesying" for seven, some say nine, generations. (See

                      I.

    AH!--What should follow slips from my reflection;
      Whatever follows ne'ertheless may be
    As à-propos of Hope or Retrospection,
      As though the lurking thought had followed free.
    All present life is but an Interjection,
      An "Oh!" or "Ah!" of Joy or Misery,
    Or a "Ha! ha!" or "Bah!"--a yawn, or "Pooh!"
    Of which perhaps the latter is most true.

                      II.

    But, more or less, the whole's a Syncopé
      Or a _Singultus_--emblems of Emotion,
    The grand Antithesis to great _Ennui_,
      Wherewith we break our bubbles on the Ocean--
    That Watery Outline of Eternity,
      Or miniature, at least, as is my notion--
    Which ministers unto the Soul's delight,
    In seeing matters which are out of sight.[733]

                      III.

    But all are better than the sigh suppressed,
      Corroding in the cavern of the heart,
    Making the countenance a masque of rest[ni]
      And turning Human Nature to an art.
    Few men dare show their thoughts of worst or best;
      Dissimulation always sets apart
    A corner for herself; and, therefore, Fiction
    Is that which passes with least contradiction.

                      IV.

    Ah! who can tell? Or rather, who can not
      Remember, without telling, Passion's errors?
    The drainer of Oblivion, even the sot,
      Hath got _blue devils_ for his morning mirrors:
    What though on Lethe's stream he seem to float,
      He cannot sink his tremours or his terrors;
    The ruby glass that shakes within his hand
    Leaves a sad sediment of Time's worst sand.

                      V.

    And as for Love--O Love!--We will proceed:--
      The Lady Adeline Amundeville,
    A pretty name as one would wish to read,
      Must perch harmonious on my tuneful quill.
    There's Music in the sighing of a reed;
      There's Music in the gushing of a rill;
    There's Music in all things, if men had ears:
    Their Earth is but an echo of the Spheres.

                      VI.

    The Lady Adeline, Right Honourable,
      And honoured, ran a risk of growing less so;
    For few of the soft sex are very stable
      In their resolves--alas! that I should say so;
    They differ as wine differs from its label,
      When once decanted;--I presume to guess so,
    But will not swear: yet both upon occasion,
    Till old, may undergo adulteration.

                      VII.

    But Adeline was of the purest vintage,
      The unmingled essence of the grape; and yet
    Bright as a new napoleon from its mintage,
      Or glorious as a diamond richly set;
    A page where Time should hesitate to print age,
      And for which Nature might forego her debt--[nj]
    Sole creditor whose process doth involve in 't
    The luck of finding everybody solvent.

                      VIII.

    O Death! thou dunnest of all duns! thou daily
      Knockest at doors, at first with modest tap,
    Like a meek tradesman when approaching palely
      Some splendid debtor he would take by sap:
    But oft denied, as Patience 'gins to fail, he
      Advances with exasperated rap,
    And (if let in) insists, in terms unhandsome,
    On ready money, or "a draft on Ransom."[734]

                      IX.

    Whate'er thou takest, spare awhile poor Beauty!
      She is so rare, and thou hast so much prey.
    What though she now and then may slip from duty,
      The more's the reason why you ought to stay;
    Gaunt Gourmand! with whole nations for your booty,--[nk]
      You should be civil in a modest way:
    Suppress, then, some slight feminine diseases,
    And take as many heroes as Heaven pleases.

                      X.

    Fair Adeline, the more ingenuous
      Where she was interested (as was said),
    Because she was not apt, like some of us,
      To like too readily, or too high bred
    To show it--(points we need not now discuss)--
      Would give up artlessly both Heart and Head
    Unto such feelings as seemed innocent,
    For objects worthy of the sentiment.

                      XI.

    Some parts of Juan's history, which Rumour,
      That live Gazette, had scattered to disfigure,
    She had heard; but Women hear with more good humour
      Such aberrations than we men of rigour:
    Besides, his conduct, since in England, grew more
      Strict, and his mind assumed a manlier vigour:
    Because he had, like Alcibiades,
    The art of living in all climes with ease.[735]

                      XII.

    His manner was perhaps the more seductive,
      Because he ne'er seemed anxious to seduce;
    Nothing affected, studied, or constructive
      Of coxcombry or conquest: no abuse
    Of his attractions marred the fair perspective,
      To indicate a Cupidon broke loose,[736]
    And seem to say, "Resist us if you can"--
    Which makes a Dandy while it spoils a Man.

                      XIII.

    They are wrong--that's not the way to set about it;
      As, if they told the truth, could well be shown.
    But, right or wrong, Don Juan was without it;
      In fact, his manner was his own alone:
    Sincere he was--at least you could not doubt it,
      In listening merely to his voice's tone.
    The Devil hath not in all his quiver's choice
    An arrow for the Heart like a sweet voice.

                      XIV.

    By nature soft, his whole address held off
      Suspicion: though not timid, his regard
    Was such as rather seemed to keep aloof,
      To shield himself than put _you_ on your guard:
    Perhaps 't was hardly quite assured enough,
      But Modesty's at times its own reward,
    Like Virtue; and the absence of pretension
    Will go much farther than there's need to mention.

                      XV.

    Serene, accomplished, cheerful but not loud;
      Insinuating without insinuation;
    Observant of the foibles of the crowd,
      Yet ne'er betraying this in conversation;
    Proud with the proud, yet courteously proud,
      So as to make them feel he knew his station
    And theirs:--without a struggle for priority,
    He neither brooked nor claimed superiority--

                      XVI.

    That is, with Men: with Women he was what
      They pleased to make or take him for; and their
    Imagination's quite enough for that:
      So that the outline's tolerably fair,
    They fill the canvas up--and _"verbum sat."_[737]
      If once their phantasies be brought to bear
    Upon an object, whether sad or playful,
    They can transfigure brighter than a Raphael.[738]

                      XVII.

    Adeline, no deep judge of character,
      Was apt to add a colouring from her own:
    'T is thus the Good will amiably err,
      And eke the Wise, as has been often shown.
    Experience is the chief philosopher,
      But saddest when his science is well known:
    And persecuted Sages teach the Schools
    Their folly in forgetting there are fools.

                      XVIII.

    Was it not so, great Locke? and greater Bacon?
      Great Socrates? And thou, Diviner still,[739]
    Whose lot it is by Man to be mistaken,[nl]
      And thy pure creed made sanction of all ill?
    Redeeming Worlds to be by bigots shaken,[nm]
      How was thy toil rewarded? We might fill
    Volumes with similar sad illustrations,
    But leave them to the conscience of the nations.

                      XIX.

    I perch upon an humbler promontory,
      Amidst Life's infinite variety:
    With no great care for what is nicknamed Glory,
      But speculating as I cast mine eye
    On what may suit or may not suit my story,
      And never straining hard to versify,
    I rattle on exactly as I'd talk
    With anybody in a ride or walk.

                      XX.

    I don't know that there may be much ability
      Shown in this sort of desultory rhyme;
    But there's a conversational facility,
      Which may round off an hour upon a time.
    Of this I'm sure at least, there's no servility
      In mine irregularity of chime,
    Which rings what's uppermost of new or hoary,[nn]
    Just as I feel the _Improvvisatore_.

                      XXI.

    "_Omnia vult_ belle _Matho dicere_--_dic aliquando_
      _Et_ bene, _dic_ neutrum, _dic aliquando_ male."[740]
    The first is rather more than mortal can do;
      The second may be sadly done or gaily;
    The third is still more difficult to stand to;
      The fourth we hear, and see, and say too, daily:
    The whole together is what I could wish
    To serve in this conundrum of a dish.

                      XXII.

    A modest hope--but Modesty's my forte,
      And Pride my feeble:[741]--let us ramble on.
    I meant to make this poem very short,
      But now I can't tell where it may not run.[no]
    No doubt, if I had wished to pay my court
      To critics, or to hail the _setting_ sun
    Of Tyranny of all kinds, my concision[742]
    Were more;--but I was born for opposition.

                      XXIII.

    But then 't is mostly on the weaker side;
      So that I verily believe if they
    Who now are basking in their full-blown pride[np]
      Were shaken down, and "dogs had had their day,"[743]
    Though at the first I might perchance deride
      Their tumble, I should turn the other way,
    And wax an ultra-royalist in Loyalty,
    Because I hate even democratic Royalty.[nq]

                      XXIV.

    I think I should have made a decent spouse,
      If I had never proved the soft condition;
    I think I should have made monastic vows
      But for my own peculiar superstition:
    'Gainst rhyme I never should have knocked my brows,
      Nor broken my own head, nor that of Priscian,[744]
    Nor worn the motley mantle of a poet,
    If some one had not told me to forego it.[745]

                      XXV.

    But _laissez aller_--Knights and Dames I sing,
      Such as the times may furnish. 'T is a flight
    Which seems at first to need no lofty wing,
      Plumed by Longinus or the Stagyrite:[nr]
    The difficulty lies in colouring
      (Keeping the due proportions still in sight)
    With Nature manners which are artificial,
    And rend'ring general that which is especial.

                      XXVI.

    The difference is, that in the days of old
      Men made the Manners; Manners now make men--
    Pinned like a flock, and fleeced too in their fold,
      At least nine, and a ninth beside of ten.
    Now this at all events must render cold
      Your writers, who must either draw again
    Days better drawn before, or else assume
    The present, with their common-place costume.

                      XXVII.

    We'll do our best to make the best on 't:--March!
      March, my Muse! If you cannot fly, yet flutter;
    And when you may not be sublime, be arch,
      Or starch, as are the edicts statesmen utter.
    We surely may find something worth research:
      Columbus found a new world in a cutter,
    Or brigantine, or pink, of no great tonnage,
    While yet America was in her non-age.[746]

                      XXVIII.

    When Adeline, in all her growing sense
      Of Juan's merits and his situation,
    Felt on the whole an interest intense,--
      Partly perhaps because a fresh sensation,
    Or that he had an air of innocence,
      Which is for Innocence a sad temptation,--
    As Women hate half measures, on the whole,[ns]
    She 'gan to ponder how to save his soul.

                      XXIX.

    She had a good opinion of Advice,
      Like all who give and eke receive it gratis,
    For which small thanks are still the market price,
      Even where the article at highest rate is:
    She thought upon the subject twice or thrice,
      And morally decided--the best state is
    For Morals--Marriage; and, this question carried,
    She seriously advised him to get married.

                      XXX.

    Juan replied, with all becoming deference,
      He had a predilection for that tie;
    But that, at present, with immediate reference
      To his own circumstances, there might lie
    Some difficulties, as in his own preference,
      Or that of her to whom he might apply:
    That still he'd wed with such or such a lady,
    If that they were not married all already.

                      XXXI.

    Next to the making matches for herself,
      And daughters, brothers, sisters, kith or kin,
    Arranging them like books on the same shelf,
      There's nothing women love to dabble in
    More (like a stock-holder in growing pelf)
      Than match-making in general: 't is no sin
    Certes, but a preventative, and therefore
    That is, no doubt, the only reason wherefore.

                      XXXII.

    But never yet (except of course a miss
      Unwed, or mistress never to be wed,
    Or wed already, who object to this)
      Was there chaste dame who had not in her head
    Some drama of the marriage Unities,
      Observed as strictly both at board and bed,
    As those of Aristotle, though sometimes
    They turn out Melodrames or Pantomimes.

                      XXXIII.

    They generally have some only son,
      Some heir to a large property, some friend
    Of an old family, some gay Sir John,
      Or grave Lord George, with whom perhaps might end
    A line, and leave Posterity undone,
      Unless a marriage was applied to mend
    The prospect and their morals: and besides,
    They have at hand a blooming glut of brides.

                      XXXIV.

    From these they will be careful to select,
      For this an heiress, and for that a beauty;
    For one a songstress who hath no defect,
      For t' other one who promises much duty;
    For this a lady no one can reject,
      Whose sole accomplishments were quite a booty;
    A second for her excellent connections;
    A third, because there can be no objections.

                      XXXV.

    When Rapp the Harmonist embargoed Marriage[747]
      In his harmonious settlement--(which flourishes
    Strangely enough as yet without miscarriage,
      Because it breeds no more mouths than it nourishes,
    Without those sad expenses which disparage
      What Nature naturally most encourages)--
    Why called he "Harmony" a state sans wedlock?
    Now here I've got the preacher at a dead lock.

                      XXXVI.

    Because he either meant to sneer at Harmony
      Or Marriage, by divorcing them thus oddly.
    But whether reverend Rapp learned this in Germany
      Or no, 't is said his sect is rich and godly,
    Pious and pure, beyond what I can term any
      Of ours, although they propagate more broadly.
    My objection's to his title, not his ritual.
    Although I wonder how it grew habitual.[nt]

                      XXXVII.

    But Rapp is the reverse of zealous matrons,
      Who favour, _malgré_ Malthus, Generation--
    Professors of that genial art, and patrons
      Of all the modest part of Propagation;
    Which after all at such a desperate rate runs,
      That half its produce tends to Emigration,
    That sad result of passions and potatoes--
    Two weeds which pose our economic Catos.

                      XXXVIII.

    Had Adeline read Malthus? I can't tell;
      I wish she had: his book's the eleventh commandment,
    Which says, "Thou shall not marry," unless _well_:
      This he (as far as I can understand) meant.
    'T is not my purpose on his views to dwell,
      Nor canvass what "so eminent a hand" meant;[748]
    But, certes, it conducts to lives ascetic,
    Or turning Marriage into Arithmetic.

                      XXXIX.

    But Adeline, who probably presumed
      That Juan had enough of maintenance,
    Or _separate_ maintenance, in case 't was doomed--
      As on the whole it is an even chance
    That bridegrooms, after they are fairly _groomed_,
      May retrograde a little in the Dance
    Of Marriage--(which might form a painter's fame,
    Like Holbein's "Dance of Death"[749]--but 't is the same)--

                      XL.

    But Adeline determined Juan's wedding
      In her own mind, and that's enough for Woman:
    But then, with whom? There was the sage Miss Reading,
      Miss Raw, Miss Flaw, Miss Showman, and Miss Knowman,[nu]
    And the two fair co-heiresses Giltbedding.
      She deemed his merits something more than common:
    All these were unobjectionable matches,
    And might go on, if well wound up, like watches.

                      XLI.

    There was Miss Millpond, smooth as summer's sea,[nv]
      That usual paragon, an only daughter,
    Who seemed the cream of Equanimity,
      Till skimmed--and then there was some milk and water,
    With a slight shade of blue too, it might be,
      Beneath the surface; but what did it matter?
    Love's riotous, but Marriage should have quiet,
    And being consumptive, live on a milk diet.

                      XLII.

    And then there was the Miss Audacia Shoestring,
      A dashing _demoiselle_ of good estate,
    Whose heart was fixed upon a star or blue string;
      But whether English Dukes grew rare of late,
    Or that she had not harped upon the true string,
      By which such Sirens can attract our great,
    She took up with some foreign younger brother,
    A Russ or Turk--the one's as good as t' other.

                      XLIII.

    And then there was--but why should I go on,
      Unless the ladies should go off?--there was
    Indeed a certain fair and fairy one,
      Of the best class, and better than her class,--
    Aurora Raby, a young star who shone
      O'er Life, too sweet an image for such glass,
    A lovely being, scarcely formed or moulded,
    A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded;

                      XLIV.

    Rich, noble, but an orphan--left an only
      Child to the care of guardians good and kind--
    But still her aspect had an air so lonely;
      Blood is not water; and where shall we find
    Feelings of Youth like those which overthrown lie
      By Death, when we are left, alas! behind,
    To feel, in friendless palaces, a home
    Is wanting, and our best ties in the tomb?

                      XLV.

    Early in years, and yet more infantine
      In figure, she had something of Sublime
    In eyes which sadly shone, as Seraphs' shine.
      All Youth--but with an aspect beyond Time;
    Radiant and grave--as pitying Man's decline;
      Mournful--but mournful of another's crime,
    She looked as if she sat by Eden's door,
    And grieved for those who could return no more.

                      XLVI.

    She was a Catholic, too, sincere, austere,
      As far as her own gentle heart allowed,
    And deemed that fallen worship far more dear
      Perhaps because 't was fallen: her Sires were proud
    Of deeds and days when they had filled the ear
      Of nations, and had never bent or bowed
    To novel power; and as she was the last,
    She held their old faith and old feelings fast.

                      XLVII.

    She gazed upon a World she scarcely knew,
      As seeking not to know it; silent, lone,
    As grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,
      And kept her heart serene within its zone.
    There was awe in the homage which she drew;
      Her Spirit seemed as seated on a throne
    Apart from the surrounding world, and strong
    In its own strength--most strange in one so young!

                      XLVIII.

    Now it so happened, in the catalogue
      Of Adeline, Aurora was omitted,
    Although her birth and wealth had given her vogue,
      Beyond the charmers we have already cited;
    Her beauty also seemed to form no clog
      Against her being mentioned as well fitted,
    By many virtues, to be worth the trouble
    Of single gentlemen who would be double.

                      XLIX.

    And this omission, like that of the bust
      Of Brutus at the pageant of Tiberius,[750]
    Made Juan wonder, as no doubt he must.
      This he expressed half smiling and half serious;
    When Adeline replied with some disgust,
      And with an air, to say the least, imperious,
    She marvelled "what he saw in such a baby
    As that prim, silent, cold Aurora Raby?"

                      L.

    Juan rejoined--"She was a Catholic,
      And therefore fittest, as of his persuasion;
    Since he was sure his mother would fall sick,
      And the Pope thunder excommunication,
    If--" But here Adeline, who seemed to pique
      Herself extremely on the inoculation
    Of others with her own opinions, stated--
    As usual--the same reason which she late did.

                      LI.

    And wherefore not? A reasonable reason,
      If good, is none the worse for repetition;
    If bad, the best way's certainly to tease on,
      And amplify: you lose much by concision,
    Whereas insisting in or out of season
      Convinces all men, even a politician;
    Or--what is just the same--it wearies out.
    So the end's gained, what signifies the route?

                      LII.

    _Why_ Adeline had this slight prejudice--
      For prejudice it was--against a creature
    As pure, as Sanctity itself, from Vice,--
      With all the added charm of form and feature,--
    For me appears a question far too nice,
      Since Adeline was liberal by nature;
    But Nature's Nature, and has more caprices
    Than I have time, or will, to take to pieces.

                      LIII.

    Perhaps she did not like the quiet way
      With which Aurora on those baubles looked,
    Which charm most people in their earlier day:
      For there are few things by Mankind less brooked,
    And Womankind too, if we so may say,
      Than finding thus their genius stand rebuked,
    Like "Antony's by Cæsar,"[751] by the few
    Who look upon them as they ought to do.

                      LIV.

    It was not envy--Adeline had none;
      Her place was far beyond it, and her mind:
    It was not scorn--which could not light on one
      Whose greatest _fault_ was leaving few to find:
    It was not jealousy, I think--but shun
      Following the _ignes fatui_ of Mankind:
    It was not----but 't is easier far, alas!
    To say what it was _not_ than what it was.

                      LV.

    Little Aurora deemed she was the theme
      Of such discussion. She was there a guest;
    A beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream
      Of Rank and Youth, though purer than the rest,
    Which flowed on for a moment in the beam
      Time sheds a moment o'er each sparkling crest.
    Had she known this, she would have calmly smiled--
    She had so much, or little, of the child.

                      LVI.

    The dashing and proud air of Adeline
      Imposed not upon her: she saw her blaze
    Much as she would have seen a glow-worm shine,
      Then turned unto the stars for loftier rays.
    Juan was something she could not divine,
      Being no Sibyl in the new world's ways;
    Yet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor,
    Because she did not pin her faith on feature.

                      LVII.

    His fame too,--for he had that kind of fame
      Which sometimes plays the deuce with Womankind,
    A heterogeneous mass of glorious blame,
      Half virtues and whole vices being combined;
    Faults which attract because they are not tame;
      Follies tricked out so brightly that they blind:--
    These seals upon her wax made no impression,
    Such was her coldness or her self-possession.

                      LVIII.

    Juan knew nought of such a character--
      High, yet resembling not his lost Haidée;
    Yet each was radiant in her proper sphere:
      The island girl, bred up by the lone sea,
    More warm, as lovely, and not less sincere,
      Was Nature's all: Aurora could not be,
    Nor would be thus:--the difference in them
    Was such as lies between a flower and gem.

                      LIX.

    Having wound up with this sublime comparison,
      Methinks we may proceed upon our narrative,
    And, as my friend Scott says, "I sound my warison;"[752]
      Scott, the superlative of my comparative--
    Scott, who can paint your Christian knight or Saracen,
      Serf--Lord--Man, with such skill as none would share it, if
    There had not been one Shakespeare and Voltaire,
    Of one or both of whom he seems the heir.[nw]

                      LX.

    I say, in my slight way I may proceed
      To play upon the surface of Humanity.
    I write the World, nor care if the World read,
      At least for this I cannot spare its vanity.
    My Muse hath bred, and still perhaps may breed
      More foes by this same scroll: when I began it, I
    Thought that it might turn out so--_now I know it_,[753]
    But still I am, or was, a pretty poet.

                      LXI.

    The conference or congress (for it ended
      As Congresses of late do) of the Lady
    Adeline and Don Juan rather blended
      Some acids with the sweets--for she was heady;
    But, ere the matter could be marred or mended,
      The silvery bell rang, not for "dinner ready,"
    But for that hour, called half-hour, given to dress,
    Though ladies' robes seem scant enough for less.

                      LXII.

    Great things were now to be achieved at table,
      With massy plate for armour, knives and forks
    For weapons; but what Muse since Homer's able
      (His feasts are not the worst part of his works)
    To draw up in array a single day-bill
      Of modern dinners? where more mystery lurks,
    In soups or sauces, or a sole _ragoút_,
    Than witches, b--ches, or physicians, brew.

                      LXIII.

    There was a goodly "soupe à la _bonne femme_"[754]
      Though God knows whence it came from; there was, too,
    A turbot for relief of those who cram,
      Relieved with "dindon à la Périgeux;"
    There also was----the sinner that I am!
      How shall I get this gourmand stanza through?--
    "Soupe à la Beauveau," whose relief was dory,
    Relieved itself by pork, for greater glory.

                      LXIV.

    But I must crowd all into one grand mess
      Or mass; for should I stretch into detail,
    My Muse would run much more into excess,
      Than when some squeamish people deem her frail;
    But though a _bonne vivante_, I must confess
      Her stomach's not her peccant part; this tale
    However doth require some slight refection,
    Just to relieve her spirits from dejection.

                      LXV.

    Fowls "à la Condé," slices eke of salmon,
      With "sauces Génevoises," and haunch of venison;
    Wines too, which might again have slain young Ammon--[755]
      A man like whom I hope we sha'n't see many soon;
    They also set a glazed Westphalian ham on,
      Whereon Apicius would bestow his benison;
    And then there was champagne with foaming whirls,
    As white as Cleopatra's melted pearls.

                      LXVI.

    Then there was God knows what "à l'Allemande,"
      "A l'Espagnole," "timballe," and "salpicon"--
    With things I can't withstand or understand,
      Though swallowed with much zest upon the whole;
    And _"entremets"_ to piddle with at hand,
      Gently to lull down the subsiding soul;
    While great Lucullus' _Robe triumphal_ muffles--
    (_There's fame_)--young partridge fillets, decked with truffles.[756]

                      LXVII.

    What are the _fillets_ on the Victor's brow
      To these? They are rags or dust. Where is the arch
    Which nodded to the nation's spoils below?
      Where the triumphal chariots' haughty march?
    Gone to where Victories must like dinners go.
      Farther I shall not follow the research:
    But oh! ye modern Heroes with your cartridges,
    When will your names lend lustre e'en to partridges?

                      LXVIII.

    Those truffles too are no bad accessaries,
      Followed by "petits puits d'amour"--a dish
    Of which perhaps the cookery rather varies,
      So every one may dress it to his wish,
    According to the best of dictionaries,
      Which encyclopedize both flesh and fish;
    But even, sans _confitures_, it no less true is,
    There's pretty picking in those _petits puits_.[757]

                      LXIX.

    The mind is lost in mighty contemplation
      Of intellect expanded on two courses;
    And Indigestion's grand multiplication
      Requires arithmetic beyond my forces.
    Who would suppose, from Adam's simple ration,
      That cookery could have called forth such resources,
    As form a science and a nomenclature
    From out the commonest demands of Nature?

                      LXX.

    The glasses jingled, and the palates tingled;
      The diners of celebrity dined well;
    The ladies with more moderation mingled
      In the feast, pecking less than I can tell;
    Also the younger men too: for a springald
      Can't, like ripe Age, in _gourmandise_ excel,
    But thinks less of good eating than the whisper
    (When seated next him) of some pretty lisper.

                      LXXI.

    Alas! I must leave undescribed the _gibier_,
      The _salmi_, the _consommé_, the _purée_,
    All which I use to make my rhymes run glibber
      Than could roast beef in our rough John Bull way:
    I must not introduce even a spare rib here,
      "Bubble and squeak" would spoil my liquid lay:
    But I have dined, and must forego, alas!
    The chaste description even of a "bécasse;"

                      LXXII.

    And fruits, and ice, and all that Art refines
      From Nature for the service of the _goût_--
    _Taste_ or the _gout_,--pronounce it as inclines
      Your stomach! Ere you dine, the French will do;
    But _after_, there are sometimes certain signs
      Which prove plain English truer of the two.
    Hast ever _had_ the _gout_? I have not had it--
    But I may have, and you too, reader, dread it.

                      LXXIII.

    The simple olives, best allies of wine,
      Must I pass over in my bill of fare?
    I must, although a favourite _plat_ of mine
      In Spain, and Lucca, Athens, everywhere:
    On them and bread 'twas oft my luck to dine--
      The grass my table-cloth, in open air,
    On Sunium or Hymettus, like Diogenes,
    Of whom half my philosophy the progeny is.[758]

                      LXXIV.

    Amidst this tumult of fish, flesh, and fowl,
      And vegetables, all in masquerade,
    The guests were placed according to their roll,
      But various as the various meats displayed:
    Don Juan sat next an "à l'Espagnole"--
      No damsel, but a dish, as hath been said;[nx]
    But so far like a lady, that 'twas drest
    Superbly, and contained a world of zest.

                      LXXV.

    By some odd chance too, he was placed between
      Aurora and the Lady Adeline--
    A situation difficult, I ween,
      For man therein, with eyes and heart, to dine.
    Also the conference which we have seen
      Was not such as to encourage him to shine,
    For Adeline, addressing few words to him,
    With two transcendent eyes seemed to look through him.

                      LXXVI.

    I sometimes almost think that eyes have ears:
      This much is sure, that, out of earshot, things
    Are somehow echoed to the pretty dears,
      Of which I can't tell whence their knowledge springs.
    Like that same mystic music of the spheres,
      Which no one hears, so loudly though it rings,
    'Tis wonderful how oft the sex have heard
    Long dialogues--which passed without a word!

                      LXXVII.

    Aurora sat with that indifference
      Which piques a _preux chevalier_--as it ought:
    Of all offences that's the worst offence,
      Which seems to hint you are not worth a thought.
    Now Juan, though no coxcomb in pretence,
      Was not exactly pleased to be so caught;
    Like a good ship entangled among ice--
    And after so much excellent advice.

                      LXXVIII.

    To his gay nothings, nothing was replied,
      Or something which was nothing, as Urbanity
    Required. Aurora scarcely looked aside,
      Nor even smiled enough for any vanity.
    The Devil was in the girl! Could it be pride?
      Or modesty, or absence, or inanity?
    Heaven knows! But Adeline's malicious eyes
    Sparkled with her successful prophecies,

                      LXXIX.

    And looked as much as if to say, "I said it;"
      A kind of triumph I'll not recommend,
    Because it sometimes, as I have seen or read it,
      Both in the case of lover and of friend,
    Will pique a gentleman, for his own credit,
      To bring what was a jest to a serious end:
    For all men prophesy what _is_ or _was_,
    And hate those who won't let them come to pass.

                      LXXX.

    Juan was drawn thus into some attentions,
      Slight but select, and just enough to express,
    To females of perspicuous comprehensions,
      That he would rather make them more than less.
    Aurora at the last (so history mentions,
      Though probably much less a fact than guess)
    So far relaxed her thoughts from their sweet prison,
    As once or twice to smile, if not to listen.

                      LXXXI.

    From answering she began to question: this
      With her was rare; and Adeline, who as yet
    Thought her predictions went not much amiss,
      Began to dread she'd thaw to a coquette--
    So very difficult, they say, it is
      To keep extremes from meeting, when once set
    In motion; but she here too much refined--
    Aurora's spirit was not of that kind.

                      LXXXII.

    But Juan had a sort of winning way,
      A proud humility, if such there be,
    Which showed such deference to what females say,
      As if each charming word were a decree.
    His tact, too, tempered him from grave to gay,
      And taught him when to be reserved or free:
    He had the art of drawing people out,
    Without their seeing what he was about.

                      LXXXIII.

    Aurora, who in her indifference
      Confounded him in common with the crowd
    Of flatterers, though she deemed he had more sense
      Than whispering foplings, or than witlings loud--
    Commenced[759] (from such slight things will great commence)
      To feel that flattery which attracts the proud
    Rather by deference than compliment,
    And wins even by a delicate dissent.[ny]

                      LXXXIV.

    And then he had good looks;--that point was carried
      _Nem. con._ amongst the women, which I grieve
    To say leads oft to _crim. con._ with the married--
      A case which to the juries we may leave,
    Since with digressions we too long have tarried.
      Now though we know of old that looks deceive,
    And always have done,--somehow these good looks
    Make more impression than the best of books.

                      LXXXV.

    Aurora, who looked more on books than faces,
      Was very young, although so very sage,
    Admiring more Minerva than the Graces,
      Especially upon a printed page.
    But Virtue's self, with all her tightest laces,
      Has not the natural stays of strict old age;
    And Socrates, that model of all duty,
    Owned to a _penchant_, though discreet, for beauty.

                      LXXXVI.

    And girls of sixteen are thus far Socratic,
      But innocently so, as Socrates;
    And really, if the Sage sublime and Attic
      At seventy years had phantasies like these,
    Which Plato in his dialogues dramatic
      Has shown, I know not why they should displease
    In virgins--always in a modest way,
    Observe,--for that with me's a _sine quâ_.[760]

                      LXXXVII.

    Also observe, that, like the great Lord Coke
      (See Littleton), whene'er I have expressed
    Opinions two, which at first sight may look
      Twin opposites, the second is the best.
    Perhaps I have a third too, in a nook,
      Or none at all--which seems a sorry jest:
    But if a writer should be quite consistent,
    How could he possibly show things existent?

                      LXXXVIII.

    If people contradict themselves, can I
      Help contradicting them, and everybody,
    Even my veracious self?--But that's a lie:
      I never did so, never will--how should I?
    He who doubts all things nothing can deny:
      Truth's fountains may be clear--her streams are muddy,
    And cut through such canals of contradiction,
    That she must often navigate o'er fiction.

                      LXXXIX.

    Apologue, Fable, Poesy, and Parable,
      Are false, but may be rendered also true,
    By those who sow them in a land that's arable:
      'Tis wonderful what Fable will not do!
    'Tis said it makes Reality more bearable:
      But what's Reality? Who has its clue?
    Philosophy? No; she too much rejects.
    Religion? _Yes_; but which of all her sects?

                      XC.

    Some millions must be wrong, that's pretty clear;
      Perhaps it may turn out that all were right.
    God help us! Since we have need on our career
      To keep our holy beacons always bright,
    'Tis time that some new prophet should appear,
      Or _old_ indulge man with a second sight.
    Opinions wear out in some thousand years,
    Without a small refreshment from the spheres.

                      XCI.

    But here again, why will I thus entangle
      Myself with Metaphysics? None can hate
    So much as I do any kind of wrangle;
      And yet, such is my folly, or my fate,
    I always knock my head against some angle
      About the present, past, or future state:
    Yet I wish well to Trojan and to Tyrian,
    For I was bred a moderate Presbyterian.

                      XCII.

    But though I am a temperate theologian,
      And also meek as a metaphysician,
    Impartial between Tyrian and Trojan,
      As Eldon[761] on a lunatic commission,--
    In politics my duty is to show John
      Bull something of the lower world's condition.
    It makes my blood boil like the springs of Hecla,[762]
    To see men let these scoundrel Sovereigns break law.

                      XCIII.

    But Politics, and Policy, and Piety,
      Are topics which I sometimes introduce,
    Not only for the sake of their variety,
      But as subservient to a moral use;
    Because my business is to _dress_ society,
      And stuff with _sage_ that very verdant goose.
    And now, that we may furnish with some matter all
    Tastes, we are going to try the Supernatural.

                      XCIV.

    And now I will give up all argument;
      And positively, henceforth, no temptation
    Shall "fool me to the top up of my bent:"--[763]
      Yes, I'll begin a thorough reformation.
    Indeed, I never knew what people meant
      By deeming that my Muse's conversation
    Was dangerous;--I think she is as harmless
    As some who labour more and yet may charm less.

                      XCV.

    Grim reader! did you ever see a ghost?
      No; but you have heard--I understand--be dumb!
    And don't regret the time you may have lost,
      For you have got that pleasure still to come:
    And do not think I mean to sneer at most
      Of these things, or by ridicule benumb
    That source of the Sublime and the Mysterious:--
    For certain reasons my belief is serious.

                      XCVI.

    Serious? You laugh;--you may: that will I not;
      My smiles must be sincere or not at all.
    I say I do believe a haunted spot
      Exists--and where? That shall I not recall,
    Because I'd rather it should be forgot,
      "Shadows the soul of Richard"[764] may appal.
    In short, upon that subject I've some qualms very
    Like those of the philosopher of Malmsbury.[765]

                      XCVII.

    The night--(I sing by night--sometimes an owl,
      And now and then a nightingale)--is dim,
    And the loud shriek of sage Minerva's fowl
      Rattles around me her discordant hymn:
    Old portraits from old walls upon me scowl--
      I wish to Heaven they would not look so grim;
    The dying embers dwindle in the grate--
    I think too that I have sat up too late:

                      XCVIII.

    And therefore, though 'tis by no means my way
      To rhyme at noon--when I have other things
    To think of, if I ever think--I say
      I feel some chilly midnight shudderings,
    And prudently postpone, until mid-day,
      Treating a topic which, alas! but brings
    Shadows;--but you must be in my condition,
    Before you learn to call this superstition.

                      XCIX.

    Between two worlds Life hovers like a star,
      'Twixt Night and Morn, upon the horizon's verge.
    How little do we know that which we are!
      How less what we may be![766] The eternal surge
    Of Time and Tide rolls on and bears afar
      Our bubbles; as the old burst, new emerge,
    Lashed from the foam of ages; while the graves
    Of Empires heave but like some passing waves.[767]

[739] As it is necessary in these times to avoid ambiguity, I say that I

was _both_. I never arraigned his creed, but the use--or abuse made of
it. Mr. Canning one day quoted Christianity to sanction negro slavery,

crucified, that black men might be scourged? If so, He had better been
born a Mulatto, to give both colours an equal chance of freedom, or at
least salvation.

that in the Christian religion there is a special denunciation against
slavery, that slavery and Christianity cannot exist together,--I think
that the honourable gentleman himself must admit that the proposition is
historically false."]

"to counsel him that he do forthwith abandon poetry and turn his
talents, which are considerable, and his opportunities, which are great,
to better account." Others, however, gave him encouragement. See, for
instance, a review by J.H. Markland, who afterwards made his name as
editor of the Roxburgh Club issue of the Chester Mysteries (whence,
perhaps, Byron derived his knowledge of "Mysteries and Moralities"),
which concludes thus: "Heartily hoping that the 'illness and depression
of spirits,' which evidently pervade the greater part of these
effusions, are entirely dispelled; confident that 'George Gordon, Lord

{554}[747] This extraordinary and flourishing German colony in America
does not entirely exclude matrimony, as the "Shakers" do; but lays such
restrictions upon it as prevents more than a certain quantum of births
within a certain number of years; which births (as Mr. Hulme [perhaps
Thomas Hulme, whose _Journal_ is quoted in _Hints to Emigrants_, 1817,
pp. 5-18] observes) generally arrive "in a little flock like those of a
farmer's lambs, all within the same month perhaps." These Harmonists (so
called from the name of their settlement) are represented as a
remarkably flourishing, pious, and quiet people. See the various recent
writers on America.

[The Harmonists were emigrants from Würtemburg, who settled (1803-1805)
under the auspices of George Rapp, in a township 120 miles north of
Philadelphia. This they sold, and "trekked" westwards to Indiana. One of
their customs was to keep watch by nights and to cry the hours to this
tune: "Again a day is past and a step made nearer to our end. Our time
runs away, and the joys of Heaven are our reward." (See _The
Philanthropist_, No. xx., 1815, vol. v, pp. 277-288.)]

{563}[756] A dish "à la Lucullus." This hero, who conquered the East,
has left his more extended celebrity to the transplantation of cherries
(which he first brought into Europe), and the nomenclature of some very
good dishes;--and I am not sure that (barring indigestion) he has not
done more service to mankind by his cookery than by his conquests. A
cherry tree may weigh against a bloody laurel; besides, he has contrived
to earn celebrity from both.

[According to Pliny (_Nat, Hist._, lib. xv. cap. xxv. ed. 1593, ii.
131), there were no cherry trees in Italy until L. Lucullus brought them
home with him from Pontus after the Mithridatic War (B.C. 74), and it
was not for another hundred and twenty years that the cherry tree

spectres and apparitions, vain bugbears of fools, which he had chased
away by the light of his Philosophy," and proceeds to argue that,
perhaps, after all, Hobbes was afraid of the dark. "He was timorous to
the last degree, and consequently he had reason to distrust his
imagination when he was alone in a chamber in the night; for in spite of
him the memory of what he had read and heard concerning apparitions
would revive, though he was not persuaded of the reality of these
things." See, however, for his own testimony that he was "not afrayd of

    The antique Persians taught three useful things,
      To draw the bow, to ride, and speak the truth,[769]
    This was the mode of Cyrus, best of kings--
      A mode adopted since by modern youth.
    Bows have they, generally with two strings;
      Horses they ride without remorse or ruth;
    At speaking truth perhaps they are less clever,
    But draw the long bow better now than ever.

                      II.

    The cause of this effect, or this defect,--
      "For this effect defective comes by cause,"--[770]
    Is what I have not leisure to inspect;
      But this I must say in my own applause,
    Of all the Muses that I recollect,
      Whate'er may be her follies or her flaws
    In some things, mine's beyond all contradiction
    The most sincere that ever dealt in fiction.

    And as she treats all things, and ne'er retreats

      Which you might elsewhere hope to find in vain.
    'Tis true there be some bitters with the sweets,

    But of all truths which she has told, the most

    Men whose historical superiority
      Is always greatest at a miracle.

      Who bids all men believe the impossible,

    Quiets at once with "_quia impossibile._"[772]

                      VI.

    And therefore, mortals, cavil not at all;
      Believe:--if 'tis improbable, you _must_,
    And if it is impossible, you _shall_:
      'Tis always best to take things upon trust.

    I merely mean to say what Johnson said,
      That in the course of some six thousand years,
    All nations have believed that from the dead
      A visitant at intervals appears:[773]

      Is, that whatever bar the reason rears
    'Gainst such belief, there's something stronger still
    In its behalf--let those deny who will.

    The dinner and the _soirée_ too were done,
      The supper too discussed, the dames admired,
    The banqueteers had dropped off one by one--
      The song was silent, and the dance expired:
    The last thin petticoats were vanished, gone
      Like fleecy clouds into the sky retired,
    And nothing brighter gleamed through the saloon
    Than dying tapers--and the peeping moon.

                      IX.

    The evaporation of a joyous day
      Is like the last glass of champagne, without
    The foam which made its virgin bumper gay;

    Or like a soda bottle when its spray
      Has sparkled and let half its spirit out;
    Or like a billow left by storms behind,
    Without the animation of the wind;

                      X.

    Or like an opiate, which brings troubled rest,
      Or none; or like--like nothing that I know
    Except itself;--such is the human breast;
      A thing, of which similitudes can show
    No real likeness,--like the old Tyrian vest
      Dyed purple, none at present can tell how,
    If from a shell-fish or from cochineal.[774]

    And Juan, on retiring for the night,
      Felt restless, and perplexed, and compromised:
    He thought Aurora Raby's eyes more bright
      Than Adeline (such is advice) advised;
    If he had known exactly his own plight,
      He probably would have philosophised:
    A great resource to all, and ne'er denied
    Till wanted; therefore Juan only sighed.

                      XIII.

    He sighed;--the next resource is the full moon,
      Where all sighs are deposited; and now
    It happened luckily, the chaste orb shone
      As clear as such a climate will allow;
    And Juan's mind was in the proper tone
      To hail her with the apostrophe--"O thou!"
    Of amatory egotism the _Tuism_,[777]
    Which further to explain would be a truism.

                      XIV.

    But Lover, Poet, or Astronomer--
      Shepherd, or swain--whoever may behold,
    Feel some abstraction when they gaze on her;
      Great thoughts we catch from thence (besides a cold
    Sometimes, unless my feelings rather err);
      Deep secrets to her rolling light are told;
    The Ocean's tides and mortals' brains she sways,
    And also hearts--if there be truth in lays.

                      XV.

    Juan felt somewhat pensive, and disposed
      For contemplation rather than his pillow:
    The Gothic chamber, where he was enclosed,
      Let in the rippling sound of the lake's billow,
    With all the mystery by midnight caused:
      Below his window waved (of course) willow;
    And he stood gazing out on the cascade
    That flashed and after darkened in the shade.

                      XVI.

    Upon his table or his toilet,[778]--_which_
      Of these is not exactly ascertained,--
    (I state this, for I am cautious to a pitch
      Of nicety, where a fact is to be gained,)
    A lamp burned high, while he leant from a niche,
      Where many a Gothic ornament remained,
    In chiselled stone and painted glass, and all
    That Time has left our fathers of their Hall.

                      XVII.

    Then, as the night was clear though cold, he threw
      His chamber door wide open[779]--and went forth
    Into a gallery of a sombre hue,
      Long, furnished with old pictures of great worth,
    Of knights and dames heroic and chaste too,
      As doubtless should be people of high birth;
    But by dim lights the portraits of the dead
    Have something ghastly, desolate, and dread.

                      XVIII.

    The forms of the grim Knight and pictured Saint
      Look living in the moon; and as you turn
    Backward and forward to the echoes faint
      Of your own footsteps--voices from the Urn
    Appear to wake, and shadows wild and quaint
      Start from the frames which fence their aspects stern,
    As if to ask how you can dare to keep
    A vigil there, where all but Death should sleep.

                      XIX.

    And the pale smile of Beauties in the grave,
      The charms of other days, in starlight gleams,
    Glimmer on high; their buried locks still wave
      Along the canvas; their eyes glance like dreams
    On ours, or spars within some dusky cave,[780]
      But Death is imaged in their shadowy beams.
    A picture is the past; even ere its frame
    Be gilt, who sate hath ceased to be the same.

                      XX.

    As Juan mused on Mutability,
      Or on his Mistress--terms synonymous--
    No sound except the echo of his sigh
      Or step ran sadly through that antique house;
    When suddenly he heard, or thought so, nigh,
      A supernatural agent--or a mouse,
    Whose little nibbling rustle will embarrass
    Most people as it plays along the arras.

                      XXI.

    It was no mouse--but lo! a monk, arrayed[781]
      In cowl and beads, and dusky garb, appeared,
    Now in the moonlight, and now lapsed in shade,
      With steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard;
    His garments only a slight murmur made;
      He moved as shadowy as the Sisters weird,[782]
    But slowly; and as he passed Juan by,
    Glanced, without pausing, on him a bright eye.

                      XXII.

    Juan was petrified; he had heard a hint
      Of such a Spirit in these halls of old,
    But thought, like most men, that there was nothing in 't
      Beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,
    Coined from surviving Superstition's mint,
      Which passes ghosts in currency like gold,
    But rarely seen, like gold compared with paper.
    And did he see this? or was it a vapour?

                      XXIII.

    Once, twice, thrice passed, repassed--the thing of air,
      Or earth beneath, or Heaven, or t' other place;
    And Juan gazed upon it with a stare,
      Yet could not speak or move; but, on its base
    As stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair
      Twine like a knot of snakes around his face;
    He taxed his tongue for words, which were not granted,
    To ask the reverend person what he wanted.

                      XXIV.

    The third time, after a still longer pause,
      The shadow passed away--but where? the hall
    Was long, and thus far there was no great cause
      To think his vanishing unnatural:
    Doors there were many, through which, by the laws
      Of physics, bodies whether short or tall
    Might come or go; but Juan could not state
    Through which the Spectre seemed to evaporate.

                      XXV.

    He stood--how long he knew not, but it seemed
      An age--expectant, powerless, with his eyes
    Strained on the spot where first the figure gleamed
      Then by degrees recalled his energies,
    And would have passed the whole off as a dream,
      But could not wake; he was, he did surmise,
    Waking already, and returned at length
    Back to his chamber, shorn of half his strength.

                      XXVI.

    All there was as he left it: still his taper
      Burned, and not _blue_, as modest tapers use,
    Receiving sprites with sympathetic vapour;
      He rubbed his eyes, and they did not refuse
    Their office: he took up an old newspaper;
      The paper was right easy to peruse;
    He read an article the King attacking,
    And a long eulogy of "Patent Blacking."

                      XXVII.

    This savoured of this world; but his hand shook:
      He shut his door, and after having read
    A paragraph, I think about Horne Tooke,
      Undressed, and rather slowly went to bed.
    There, couched all snugly on his pillow's nook,
      With what he had seen his phantasy he fed;
    And though it was no opiate, slumber crept
    Upon him by degrees, and so he slept.

                      XXVIII.

    He woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,
      Pondered upon his visitant or vision,
    And whether it ought not to be disclosed,
      At risk of being quizzed for superstition.
    The more he thought, the more his mind was posed:
      In the mean time, his valet, whose precision
    Was great, because his master brooked no less,
    Knocked to inform him it was time to dress.

                      XXIX.

    He dressed; and like young people he was wont
      To take some trouble with his toilet, but
    This morning rather spent less time upon 't;
      Aside his very mirror soon was put;
    His curls fell negligently o'er his front,
      His clothes were not curbed to their usual cut,
    His very neckcloth's Gordian knot was tied
    Almost an hair's breadth too much on one side.

                      XXX.

    And when he walked down into the Saloon,
      He sate him pensive o'er a dish of tea,
    Which he perhaps had not discovered soon,
      Had it not happened scalding hot to be,
    Which made him have recourse unto his spoon;
      So much _distrait_ he was, that all could see
    That something was the matter--Adeline
    The first--but _what_ she could not well divine.

                      XXXI.

    She looked, and saw him pale, and turned as pale
      Herself; then hastily looked down, and muttered
    Something, but what's not stated in my tale.
      Lord Henry said, his muffin was ill buttered;
    The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke played with her veil,
      And looked at Juan hard, but nothing uttered.
    Aurora Raby with her large dark eyes
    Surveyed him with a kind of calm surprise.

                      XXXII.

    But seeing him all cold and silent still,
      And everybody wondering more or less,
    Fair Adeline inquired, "If he were ill?"
      He started, and said, "Yes--no--rather--yes."
    The family physician had great skill,
      And being present, now began to express
    His readiness to feel his pulse and tell
    The cause, but Juan said, he was "quite well."

                      XXXIII.

    "Quite well; yes,--no."--These answers were mysterious,
      And yet his looks appeared to sanction both,
    However they might savour of delirious;
      Something like illness of a sudden growth
    Weighed on his spirit, though by no means serious:
      But for the rest, as he himself seemed both
    To state the case, it might be ta'en for granted
    It was not the physician that he wanted.

                      XXXIV.

    Lord Henry, who had now discussed his chocolate,
      Also the muffin whereof he complained,
    Said, Juan had not got his usual look elate,
      At which he marvelled, since it had not rained;
    Then asked her Grace what news were of the Duke of late?
      _Her_ Grace replied, _his_ Grace was rather pained
    With some slight, light, hereditary twinges
    Of gout, which rusts aristocratic hinges.

                      XXXV.

    Then Henry turned to Juan, and addressed
      A few words of condolence on his state:
    "You look," quoth he, "as if you had had your rest
      Broke in upon by the Black Friar of late."
    "What Friar?" said Juan; and he did his best
      To put the question with an air sedate,
    Or careless; but the effort was not valid
    To hinder him from growing still more pallid.

                      XXXVI.

    "Oh! have you never heard of the Black Friar?
      The Spirit of these walls?"--"In truth not I."
    "Why Fame--but Fame you know's sometimes a liar--
      Tells an odd story, of which by and by:
    Whether with time the Spectre has grown shyer,
      Or that our Sires had a more gifted eye
    For such sights, though the tale is half believed,
    The Friar of late has not been oft perceived.

                      XXXVII.

    "The last time was----"--"I pray," said Adeline--
      (Who watched the changes of Don Juan's brow,
    And from its context thought she could divine
      Connections stronger than he chose to avow
    With this same legend)--"if you but design
      To jest, you'll choose some other theme just now,
    Because the present tale has oft been told,
    And is not much improved by growing old."

                      XXXVIII.

    "Jest!" quoth Milor; "why, Adeline, you know
      That we ourselves--'twas in the honey moon
    Saw----"--"Well, no matter, 'twas so long ago;
      But, come, I'll set your story to a tune."
    Graceful as Dian when she draws her bow,
      She seized her harp, whose strings were kindled soon
    As touched, and plaintively began to play
    The air of "'Twas a Friar of Orders Gray."[nz]

                      XXXIX.

    "But add the words," cried Henry, "which you made;
      For Adeline is half a poetess,"
    Turning round to the rest, he smiling said.
      Of course the others could not but express
    In courtesy their wish to see displayed
      By one _three_ talents, for there were no less--
    The voice, the words, the harper's skill, at once,
    Could hardly be united by a dunce.

                      XL.

    After some fascinating hesitation,--
      The charming of these charmers, who seem bound,
    I can't tell why, to this dissimulation,--
      Fair Adeline, with eyes fixed on the ground
    At first, then kindling into animation,
      Added her sweet voice to the lyric sound,
    And sang with much simplicity,--a merit
    Not the less precious, that we seldom hear it.

1.

    Beware! beware! of the Black Friar,
      Who sitteth by Norman stone,
    For he mutters his prayer in the midnight air,
      And his mass of the days that are gone.
    When the Lord of the Hill, Amundeville,
      Made Norman Church his prey,
    And expelled the friars, one friar still
    Would not be driven away.

2.

    Though he came in his might, with King Henry's right,
      To turn church lands to lay,
    With sword in hand, and torch to light
      Their walls, if they said nay;
    A monk remained, unchased, unchained,
      And he did not seem formed of clay,
    For he's seen in the porch, and he's seen in the church,
    Though he is not seen by day.

3.

    And whether for good, or whether for ill,
      It is not mine to say;
    But still with the house of Amundeville
      He abideth night and day.
    By the marriage-bed of their lords, 'tis said,
      He flits on the bridal eve;
    And 'tis held as faith, to their bed of Death[oa]
    He comes--but not to grieve.

4.

    When an heir is born, he's heard to mourn,
      And when aught is to befall
    That ancient line, in the pale moonshine
      He walks from hall to hall.
    His form you may trace, but not his face,
      'Tis shadowed by his cowl;
    But his eyes may be seen from the folds between,
    And they seem of a parted soul.

5.

    But beware! beware! of the Black Friar,
      He still retains his sway,
    For he is yet the Church's heir,
      Whoever may be the lay.
    Amundeville is Lord by day,
      But the monk is Lord by night;
    Nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal
    To question that Friar's right.

    Say nought to him as he walks the Hall,
      And he'll say nought to you;
    He sweeps along in his dusky pall,
      As o'er the grass the dew.
    Then grammercy! for the Black Friar;
      Heaven sain him! fair or foul,--
    And whatsoe'er may be his prayer,
    Let ours be for his soul.

                      XLI.

    The lady's voice ceased, and the thrilling wires
      Died from the touch that kindled them to sound;
    And the pause followed, which when song expires
      Pervades a moment those who listen round;
    And then of course the circle much admires,
      Nor less applauds, as in politeness bound,
    The tones, the feeling, and the execution,
    To the performer's diffident confusion.

                      XLII.

    Fair Adeline, though in a careless way,
      As if she rated such accomplishment
    As the mere pastime of an idle day,
      Pursued an instant for her own content,
    Would now and then as 'twere _without_ display,
      Yet _with_ display in fact, at times relent
    To such performances with haughty smile,
    To show she _could_, if it were worth her while.

                      XLIII.

    Now this (but we will whisper it aside)
      Was--pardon the pedantic illustration--
    Trampling on Plato's pride with greater pride,
      As did the Cynic on some like occasion;
    Deeming the sage would be much mortified,
      Or thrown into a philosophic passion,
    For a spoilt carpet--but the "Attic Bee"
    Was much consoled by his own repartee.[783]

                      XLIV.

    Thus Adeline would throw into the shade
      (By doing easily, whene'er she chose,
    What dilettanti do with vast parade)
      Their sort of _half profession_; for it grows
    To something like this when too oft displayed;
      And that it is so, everybody knows,
    Who have heard Miss That or This, or Lady T'other,
    Show off--to please their company or mother.

                      XLV.

    Oh! the long evenings of duets and trios!
      The admirations and the speculations;
    The "Mamma Mia's!" and the "Amor Mio's!"
      The "Tanti palpiti's" on such occasions:
    The "Lasciami's," and quavering "Addio's,"
      Amongst our own most musical of nations!
    With "Tu mi chamas's" from Portingale,[784]
    To soothe our ears, lest Italy should fail.[785]

                      XLVI.

    In Babylon's _bravuras_--as the Home-
      Heart-Ballads of Green Erin or Grey Highlands,
    That bring Lochaber back to eyes that roam
      O'er far Atlantic continents or islands,
    The calentures[786] of music which o'ercome
      All mountaineers with dreams that they are nigh lands,
    No more to be beheld but in such visions--
    Was Adeline well versed, as compositions.

                      XLVII.

    She also had a twilight tinge of "_Blue_,"
      Could write rhymes, and compose more than she wrote,
    Made epigrams occasionally too
      Upon her friends, as everybody ought.
    But still from that sublimer azure hue,[787]
      So much the present dye, she was remote;
    Was weak enough to deem Pope a great poet,
    And what was worse, was not ashamed to show it.

                      XLVIII.

    Aurora--since we are touching upon taste,
      Which now-a-days is the thermometer
    By whose degrees all characters are classed--
      Was more Shakespearian, if I do not err.
    The worlds beyond this World's perplexing waste
      Had more of her existence, for in her
    There was a depth of feeling to embrace
    Thoughts, boundless, deep, but silent too as Space.

                      XLIX.

    Not so her gracious, graceful, graceless Grace,
      The full-grown Hebe of Fitz-Fulke, whose mind,
    If she had any, was upon her face,
      And that was of a fascinating kind.
    A little turn for mischief you might trace
      Also thereon,--but that's not much; we find
    Few females without some such gentle leaven,
    For fear we should suppose us quite in Heaven.

                      L.

    I have not heard she was at all poetic,
      Though once she was seen reading the _Bath Guide_,[788]
    And Hayley's _Triumphs_,[789] which she deemed pathetic,
      Because she said _her temper_ had been tried
    So much, the bard had really been prophetic
      Of what she had gone through with--since a bride.
    But of all verse, what most ensured her praise
    Were sonnets to herself, or _bouts rimés_.

                      LI.

    'Twere difficult to say what was the object
      Of Adeline, in bringing this same lay
    To bear on what appeared to her the subject
      Of Juan's nervous feelings on that day.
    Perhaps she merely had the simple project
      To laugh him out of his supposed dismay;
    Perhaps she might wish to confirm him in it,
    Though why I cannot say--at least this minute.

                      LII.

    But so far the immediate effect
      Was to restore him to his self-propriety,
    A thing quite necessary to the elect,
      Who wish to take the tone of their society:
    In which you cannot be too circumspect,
      Whether the mode be persiflage or piety,
    But wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy,
    On pain of much displeasing the gynocracy.[790]

                      LIII.

    And therefore Juan now began to rally
      His spirits, and without more explanation
    To jest upon such themes in many a sally.
      Her Grace, too, also seized the same occasion,
    With various similar remarks to tally,
      But wished for a still more detailed narration
    Of this same mystic friar's curious doings,
    About the present family's deaths and wooings.

                      LIV.

    Of these few could say more than has been said;
      They passed as such things do, for superstition
    With some, while others, who had more in dread
      The theme, half credited the strange tradition;
    And much was talked on all sides on that head:
      But Juan, when cross-questioned on the vision,
    Which some supposed (though he had not avowed it)
    Had stirred him, answered in a way to cloud it.

                      LV.

    And then, the mid-day having worn to one,
      The company prepared to separate;
    Some to their several pastimes, or to none,
      Some wondering 'twas so early, some so late.
    There was a goodly match too, to be run
      Between some greyhounds on my Lord's estate,
    And a young race-horse of old pedigree,
    Matched for the spring, whom several went to see.

                      LVI.

    There was a picture-dealer who had brought
      A special Titian, warranted original,
    So precious that it was not to be bought,
      Though Princes the possessor were besieging all--
    The King himself had cheapened it, but thought
      The civil list he deigns to accept (obliging all
    His subjects by his gracious acceptation)--
    Too scanty, in these times of low taxation.

                      LVII.

    But as Lord Henry was a connoisseur,--
      The friend of Artists, if not Arts,--the owner,
    With motives the most classical and pure,
      So that he would have been the very donor,
    Rather than seller, had his wants been fewer,
      So much he deemed his patronage an honour,
    Had brought the _capo d'opera_, not for sale,
    But for his judgment--never known to fail.

                      LVIII.

    There was a modern Goth, I mean a Gothic
      Bricklayer of Babel, called an architect,[ob]
    Brought to survey these grey walls which, though so thick,
      Might have from Time acquired some slight defect;
    Who, after rummaging the Abbey through thick
      And thin, produced a plan whereby to erect
    New buildings of correctest conformation,
    And throw down old--which he called _restoration_.[791]

                      LIX.

    The cost would be a trifle--an "old song,"
      Set to some thousands ('tis the usual burden
    Of that same tune, when people hum it long)--
      The price would speedily repay its worth in
    An edifice no less sublime than strong,
      By which Lord Henry's good taste would go forth in
    Its glory, through all ages shining sunny,
    For Gothic daring shown in English money.[792]

                      LX.

    There were two lawyers busy on a mortgage
      Lord Henry wished to raise for a new purchase;
    Also a lawsuit upon tenures burgage,[793]
      And one on tithes, which sure as Discord's torches,
    Kindling Religion till she throws down _her_ gage,
      "Untying" squires "to fight against the churches;"[794]
    There was a prize ox, a prize pig, and ploughman,
    For Henry was a sort of Sabine showman.

                      LXI.

    There were two poachers caught in a steel trap,
      Ready for gaol, their place of convalescence;
    There was a country girl in a close cap
      And scarlet cloak (I hate the sight to see, since--
    Since--since--in youth, I had the sad mishap--
      But luckily I have paid few parish fees since):[795]
    That scarlet cloak, alas! unclosed with rigour,
    Presents the problem of a double figure.

                      LXII.

    A reel within a bottle is a mystery,
      One can't tell how it e'er got in or out;
    Therefore the present piece of natural history
      I leave to those who are fond of solving doubt;
    And merely state, though not for the Consistory,
      Lord Henry was a Justice, and that Scout
    The constable, beneath a warrant's banner,
    Had bagged this poacher upon Nature's manor.

                      LXIII.

    Now Justices of Peace must judge all pieces
      Of mischief of all kinds, and keep the game
    And morals of the country from caprices
      Of those who have not a licence for the same;
    And of all things, excepting tithes and leases,
      Perhaps these are most difficult to tame:
    Preserving partridges and pretty wenches
    Are puzzles to the most precautions benches.

                      LXIV.

    The present culprit was extremely pale,
      Pale as if painted so; her cheek being red
    By nature, as in higher dames less hale
      'Tis white, at least when they just rise from bed.
    Perhaps she was ashamed of seeming frail,
      Poor soul! for she was country born and bred,
    And knew no better in her immorality
    Than to wax white--for blushes are for quality.

                      LXV.

    Her black, bright, downcast, yet _espiègle_ eye,
      Had gathered a large tear into its corner,
    Which the poor thing at times essayed to dry,
      For she was not a sentimental mourner
    Parading all her sensibility,
      Nor insolent enough to scorn the scorner,
    But stood in trembling, patient tribulation,
    To be called up for her examination.

                      LXVI.

    Of course these groups were scattered here and there,
      Not nigh the gay saloon of ladies gent.[796]
    The lawyers in the study; and in air
      The prize pig, ploughman, poachers: the men sent
    From town, viz. architect and dealer, were
      Both busy (as a General in his tent
    Writing despatches) in their several stations,
    Exulting in their brilliant lucubrations.

                      LXVII.

    But this poor girl was left in the great hall,
      While Scout, the parish guardian of the frail,
    Discussed (he hated beer yclept the "small")
      A mighty mug of _moral_ double ale.
    She waited until Justice could recall
      Its kind attentions to their proper pale,
    To name a thing in nomenclature rather[oc]
    Perplexing for most virgins--a child's father.

                      LXVIII.

    You see here was enough of occupation
      For the Lord Henry, linked with dogs and horses.
    There was much bustle too, and preparation
      Below stairs on the score of second courses;
    Because, as suits their rank and situation,
      Those who in counties have great land resources
    Have "public days," when all men may carouse,
    Though not exactly what's called "open house."

                      LXIX.

    But once a week or fortnight, _un_invited
      (Thus we translate a _general invitation_)
    All country gentlemen, esquired or knighted,
      May drop in without cards, and take their station
    At the full board, and sit alike delighted
      With fashionable wines and conversation;
    And, as the isthmus of the grand connection,
    Talk o'er themselves the past and next election.

                      LXX.

    Lord Henry was a great electioneerer,
      Burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit.
    But county contests cost him rather dearer,
      Because the neighbouring Scotch Earl of Giftgabbit
    Had English influence, in the self-same sphere here;
      His son, the Honourable Dick Dicedrabbit,
    Was member for the "other interest" (meaning
    The same self-interest, with a different leaning).

                      LXXI.

    Courteous and cautious therefore in his county,
      He was all things to all men, and dispensed
    To some civility, to others bounty,
      And promises to all--which last commenced
    To gather to a somewhat large amount, he
      Not calculating how much they condensed;
    But what with keeping some, and breaking others,
    His word had the same value as another's.

                      LXXII.

    A friend to Freedom and freeholders--yet
      No less a friend to Government--he held,
    That he exactly the just medium hit
      Twixt Place and Patriotism--albeit compelled,
    Such was his Sovereign's pleasure, (though unfit,
      He added modestly, when rebels railed,)
    To hold some sinecures he wished abolished,
    But that with them all Law would be demolished.

                      LXXIII.

    He was "free to confess"--(whence comes this phrase?
      Is 't English? No--'tis only parliamentary)
    That Innovation's spirit now-a-days
      Had made more progress than for the last century.
    He would not tread a factious path to praise,
      Though for the public weal disposed to venture high;
    As for his place, he could but say this of it,
    That the fatigue was greater than the profit.

                      LXXIV.

    Heaven, and his friends, knew that a private life
      Had ever been his sole and whole ambition;
    But could he quit his King in times of strife,
      Which threatened the whole country with perdition?
    When demagogues would with a butcher's knife
      Cut through and through (oh! damnable incision!)
    The Gordian or the G_e_ordi-an knot, whose strings
    Have tied together Commons, Lords, and Kings.

                      LXXV.

    Sooner "come Place into the Civil List
      And champion him to the utmost[797]--" he would keep it,
    Till duly disappointed or dismissed:
      Profit he cared not for, let others reap it;
    But should the day come when Place ceased to exist,
      The country would have far more cause to weep it:
    For how could it go on? Explain who can!
    _He_ gloried in the name of Englishman.

                      LXXVI.

    He was as independent--aye, much more--
      Than those who were not paid for independence,
    As common soldiers, or a common----shore,
      Have in their several arts or parts ascendance
    O'er the irregulars in lust or gore,
      Who do not give professional attendance.
    Thus on the mob all statesmen are as eager
    To prove their pride, as footmen to a beggar.

                      LXXVII.

    All this (save the last stanza) Henry said,
      And thought. I say no more--I've said too much;
    For all of us have either heard or read--
      Off--or _upon_ the hustings--some slight such
    Hints from the independent heart or head
      Of the official candidate. I'll touch
    No more on this--the dinner-bell hath rung,
    And grace is said; the grace I _should_ have _sung_--

                      LXXVIII.

    But I'm too late, and therefore must make play.
      'Twas a great banquet, such as Albion old
    Was wont to boast--as if a glutton's tray
      Were something very glorious to behold.
    But 'twas a public feast and public day,--
      Quite full--right dull--guests hot, and dishes cold,--
    Great plenty, much formality, small cheer,--
    And everybody out of their own sphere.

                      LXXIX.

    The squires familiarly formal, and
      My Lords and Ladies proudly condescending;
    The very servants puzzling how to hand
      Their plates--without it might be too much bending
    From their high places by the sideboard's stand--
      Yet, like their masters, fearful of offending;
    For any deviation from the graces
    Might cost both man and master too--their _places_.

                      LXXX.

    There were some hunters bold, and coursers keen,
      Whose hounds ne'er erred, nor greyhounds deigned to lurch;
    Some deadly shots too, Septembrizers,[798] seen
      Earliest to rise, and last to quit the search
    Of the poor partridge through his stubble screen.
      There were some massy members of the church,
    Takers of tithes, and makers of good matches,
    And several who sung fewer psalms than catches.

                      LXXXI.

    There were some country wags too--and, alas!
      Some exiles from the Town, who had been driven
    To gaze, instead of pavement, upon grass,
      And rise at nine in lieu of long eleven.
    And lo! upon that day it came to pass,
      I sate next that o'erwhelming son of Heaven,
    The very powerful parson, Peter Pith,[799]
    The loudest wit I e'er was deafened with.

                      LXXXII.

    I knew him in his livelier London days,
      A brilliant diner-out, though but a curate,
    And not a joke he cut but earned its praise,
      Until Preferment, coming at a sure rate,
    (O Providence! how wondrous are thy ways!
      Who would suppose thy gifts sometimes obdurate?)
    Gave him, to lay the Devil who looks o'er Lincoln,[800]
    A fat fen vicarage, and nought to think on.

                      LXXXIII.

    His jokes were sermons, and his sermons jokes;
      But both were thrown away amongst the fens;
    For Wit hath no great friend in aguish folks.[od]
      No longer ready ears and short-hand pens
    Imbibed the gay _bon-mot_, or happy hoax:[oe]
      The poor priest was reduced to common sense,
    Or to coarse efforts very loud and long,
    To hammer a hoarse laugh from the thick throng.[of]

                      LXXXIV.

    There _is_ a difference, says the song, "between
      A beggar and a Queen,"[801] or _was_ (of late
    The latter worse used of the two we've seen--
      But we 'll say nothing of affairs of state);
    A difference "'twixt a Bishop and a Dean,"
      A difference between crockery ware and plate,
    As between English beef and Spartan broth--
    And yet great heroes have been bred by both.

                      LXXXV.

    But of all Nature's discrepancies, none
      Upon the whole is greater than the difference
    Beheld between the Country and the Town,
      Of which the latter merits every preference
    From those who have few resources of their own.
      And only think, or act, or feel, with reference
    To some small plan of interest or ambition--
    Both which are limited to no condition.

                      LXXXVI.

    But _En avant!_ The light loves languish o'er
      Long banquets and too many guests, although
    A slight repast makes people love much more,
      Bacchus and Ceres being, as we know,
    Even from our grammar upwards, friends of yore
      With vivifying Venus,[802] who doth owe
    To these the invention of champagne and truffles:
    Temperance delights her, but long fasting ruffles.

                      LXXXVII.

    Dully passed o'er the dinner of the day;
      And Juan took his place, he knew not where,
    Confused, in the confusion, and _distrait_,
      And sitting as if nailed upon his chair:
    Though knives and forks clanked round as in a fray,
      He seemed unconscious of all passing there,
    Till some one, with a groan, expressed a wish
    (Unheeded twice) to have a fin of fish.

                      LXXXVIII.

    On which, at the _third_ asking of the banns,
      He started; and perceiving smiles around
    Broadening to grins, he coloured more than once,
      And hastily--as nothing can confound
    A wise man more than laughter from a dunce--
      Inflicted on the dish a deadly wound,
    And with such hurry, that, ere he could curb it,
    He had paid his neighbour's prayer with half a turbot.

                      LXXXIX.

    This was no bad mistake, as it occurred,
      The supplicator being an amateur;
    But others, who were left with scarce a third,
      Were angry--as they well might, to be sure,
    They wondered how a young man so absurd
      Lord Henry at his table should endure;
    And this, and his not knowing how much oats
    Had fallen last market, cost his host three votes.

                      XC.

    They little knew, or might have sympathized,
      That he the night before had seen a ghost,
    A prologue which but slightly harmonized
      With the substantial company engrossed
    By matter, and so much materialised,
      That one scarce knew at what to marvel most
    Of two things--_how_ (the question rather odd is)
    Such bodies could have souls, or souls such bodies!

                      XCI.

    But what confused him more than smile or stare
      From all the 'squires and 'squiresses around,
    Who wondered at the abstraction of his air,
      Especially as he had been renowned
    For some vivacity among the fair,
      Even in the country circle's narrow bound--
    (For little things upon my Lord's estate
    Were good small talk for others still less great)--

                      XCII.

    Was, that he caught Aurora's eye on his,
      And something like a smile upon her cheek.
    Now this he really rather took amiss;
      In those who rarely smile, their smile bespeaks
    A strong external motive; and in this
      Smile of Aurora's there was nought to pique,
    Or Hope, or Love--with any of the wiles
    Which some pretend to trace in ladies' smiles.

                      XCIII.

    'Twas a mere quiet smile of contemplation,
      Indicative of some surprise and pity;
    And Juan grew carnation with vexation,
      Which was not very wise, and still less witty,
    Since he had gained at least her observation,
      A most important outwork of the city--
    As Juan should have known, had not his senses
    By last night's Ghost been driven from their defences.

                      XCIV.

    But what was bad, she did not blush in turn,
      Nor seem embarrassed--quite the contrary;
    Her aspect was as usual, still--_not_ stern--
      And she withdrew, but cast not down, her eye,
    Yet grew a little pale--with what? concern?
      I know not; but her colour ne'er was high--
    Though sometimes faintly flushed--and always clear,
    As deep seas in a sunny atmosphere.

                      XCV.

    But Adeline was occupied by fame
      This day; and watching, witching, condescending
    To the consumers of fish, fowl, and game,
      And dignity with courtesy so blending,
    As all must blend whose part it is to aim
      (Especially as the sixth year is ending)
    At their lord's, son's, or similar connection's
    Safe conduct through the rocks of re-elections.

                      XCVI.

    Though this was most expedient on the whole
      And usual--Juan, when he cast a glance
    On Adeline while playing her grand _rôle_,
      Which she went through as though it were a dance,
    Betraying only now and then her soul
      By a look scarce perceptibly askance
    (Of weariness or scorn), began to feel
    Some doubt how much of Adeline was _real_;

                      XCVII.

    So well she acted all and every part
      By turns--with that vivacious versatility,
    Which many people take for want of heart.
      They err--'tis merely what is called mobility,[803]
    A thing of temperament and not of art,
      Though seeming so, from its supposed facility;
    And false--though true; for, surely, they're sincerest
    Who are strongly acted on by what is nearest.

                      XCVIII.

    This makes your actors, artists, and romancers,
      Heroes sometimes, though seldom--sages never:
    But speakers, bards, diplomatists, and dancers,
      Little that's great, but much of what is clever;
    Most orators, but very few financiers,
      Though all Exchequer Chancellors endeavour,
    Of late years, to dispense with Cocker's rigours,[804]
    And grow quite figurative with their figures.

                      XCIX.

    The poets of Arithmetic are they
      Who, though they prove not two and two to be
    Five, as they might do in a modest way,
      Have plainly made it out that four are three,
    Judging by what they take, and what they pay:
      The Sinking Fund's unfathomable sea,
    That most unliquidating liquid, leaves
    The debt unsunk, yet sinks all it receives.

                      C.

    While Adeline dispensed her airs and graces,
      The fair Fitz-Fulke seemed very much at ease;
    Though too well bred to quiz men to their faces,
      Her laughing blue eyes with a glance could seize
    The ridicules of people in all places--
      That honey of your fashionable bees--
    And store it up for mischievous enjoyment;
    And this at present was her kind employment.

                      CI.

    However, the day closed, as days must close;
      The evening also waned--and coffee came.
    Each carriage was announced, and ladies rose,
      And curtsying off, as curtsies country dame,
    Retired: with most unfashionable bows
      Their docile Esquires also did the same,
    Delighted with their dinner and their Host,
    But with the Lady Adeline the most.

                      CII.

    Some praised her beauty: others her great grace;
      The warmth of her politeness, whose sincerity
    Was obvious in each feature of her face,
      Whose traits were radiant with the rays of verity.
    Yes; _she_ was truly worthy _her_ high place!
      No one could envy her deserved prosperity.
    And then her dress--what beautiful simplicity
    Draperied her form with curious felicity![805]

                      CIII.

    Meanwhile sweet Adeline deserved their praises,
      By an impartial indemnification
    For all her past exertion and soft phrases,
      In a most edifying conversation,
    Which turned upon their late guests' miens and faces,
      Their families, even to the last relation;
    Their hideous wives, their horrid selves and dresses,
    And truculent distortion of their tresses.

                      CIV.

    True, _she_ said little--'twas the rest that broke
      Forth into universal epigram;
    But then 'twas to the purpose what she spoke:
      Like Addison's "faint praise,"[806] so wont to damn,
    Her own but served to set off every joke,
      As music chimes in with a melodrame.
    How sweet the task to shield an absent friend!
    I ask but this of mine, to----_not_ defend.

                      CV.

    There were but two exceptions to this keen
      Skirmish of wits o'er the departed; one,
    Aurora, with her pure and placid mien;
      And Juan, too, in general behind none
    In gay remark on what he had heard or seen,
      Sate silent now, his usual spirits gone:
    In vain he heard the others rail or rally,
    He would not join them in a single sally.

                      CVI.

    'Tis true he saw Aurora look as though
      She approved his silence; she perhaps mistook
    Its motive for that charity we owe
      But seldom pay the absent, nor would look
    Farther--it might or it might not be so.
      But Juan, sitting silent in his nook,
    Observing little in his reverie,
    Yet saw this much, which he was glad to see.

                      CVII.

    The Ghost at least had done him this much good,
      In making him as silent as a ghost,
    If in the circumstances which ensued
      He gained esteem where it was worth the most;
    And, certainly, Aurora had renewed
      In him some feelings he had lately lost,
    Or hardened; feelings which, perhaps ideal,
    Are so divine, that I must deem them real:--

                      CVIII.

    The love of higher things and better days;
      The unbounded hope, and heavenly ignorance
    Of what is called the World, and the World's ways;
      The moments when we gather from a glance
    More joy than from all future pride or praise,
      Which kindle manhood, but can ne'er entrance
    The Heart in an existence of its own,
    Of which another's bosom is the zone.

                      CIX.

    Who would not sigh Αἴ αἴ τὰν Κυθέρειαν [Greek: Ai)/ ai)/ ta\n Kythe/reian][807]
      That _hath_ a memory, or that _had_ a heart?
    Alas! _her_ star must fade like that of Dian:
      Ray fades on ray, as years on years depart.
    Anacreon only had the soul to tie an
      Unwithering myrtle round the unblunted dart
    Of Eros: but though thou hast played us many tricks,
    Still we respect thee,"_Alma Venus Genetrix!_"[808]

                      CX.

    And full of sentiments, sublime as billows
      Heaving between this World and Worlds beyond,
    Don Juan, when the midnight hour of pillows
      Arrived, retired to his; but to despond
    Rather than rest. Instead of poppies, willows
      Waved o'er his couch; he meditated, fond
    Of those sweet bitter thoughts which banish sleep,
    And make the worldling sneer, the youngling weep.

                      CXI.

    The night was as before: he was undrest,
      Saving his night-gown, which is an undress;
    Completely _sans culotte_, and without vest;
      In short, he hardly could be clothed with less:
    But apprehensive of his spectral guest,
      He sate with feelings awkward to express
    (By those who have not had such visitations),
    Expectant of the Ghost's fresh operations.

                      CXII.

    And not in vain he listened;--Hush! what's that?
      I see--I see--Ah, no!--'t is not--yet 't is--
    Ye powers! it is the--the--the--Pooh! the cat!
      The Devil may take that stealthy pace of his!
    So like a spiritual pit-a-pat,
      Or tiptoe of an amatory Miss,
    Gliding the first time to a _rendezvous_,
    And dreading the chaste echoes of her shoe.

                      CXIII.

    Again--what is 't? The wind? No, no,--this time
      It is the sable Friar as before,
    With awful footsteps regular as rhyme,
      Or (as rhymes may be in these days) much more.
    Again through shadows of the night sublime,
      When deep sleep fell on men,[809] and the World wore
    The starry darkness round her like a girdle
    Spangled with gems--the Monk made his blood curdle.

                      CXIV.

    A noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,[810]
      Which sets the teeth on edge; and a slight clatter,
    Like showers which on the midnight gusts will pass,
      Sounding like very supernatural water,
    Came over Juan's ear, which throbbed, alas!
      For Immaterialism's a serious matter;
    So that even those whose faith is the most great
    In Souls immortal, shun them _tête-à-tête_.

                      CXV.

    Were his eyes open?--Yes! and his mouth too.
      Surprise has this effect--to make one dumb,
    Yet leave the gate which Eloquence slips through
      As wide as if a long speech were to come.
    Nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew,
      Tremendous to a mortal tympanum:
    His eyes were open, and (as was before
    Stated) his mouth. What opened next?--the door.

                      CXVI.

    It opened with a most infernal creak,
      Like that of Hell. "Lasciate ogni speranza,
    Voi, ch' entrate!"[811] The hinge seemed to speak,
      Dreadful as Dante's _rima_, or this stanza;
    Or--but all words upon such themes are weak:
      A single shade's sufficient to entrance a
    Hero--for what is Substance to a Spirit?
    Or how is 't _Matter_ trembles to come near it?[og]

                      CXVII.

    The door flew wide, not swiftly,--but, as fly
      The sea-gulls, with a steady, sober flight--
    And then swung back; nor close--but stood awry,
      Half letting in long shadows on the light,
    Which still in Juan's candlesticks burned high,
      For he had two, both tolerably bright,
    And in the doorway, darkening darkness, stood
    The sable Friar in his solemn hood.

                      CXVIII.

    Don Juan shook, as erst he had been shaken
      The night before; but being sick of shaking,
    He first inclined to think he had been mistaken;
      And then to be ashamed of such mistaking;
    His own internal ghost began to awaken
      Within him, and to quell his corporal quaking--
    Hinting that Soul and Body on the whole
    Were odds against a disembodied Soul.

                      CXIX.

    And then his dread grew wrath, and his wrath fierce,
      And he arose, advanced--the Shade retreated;
    But Juan, eager now the truth to pierce,
      Followed, his veins no longer cold, but heated,
    Resolved to thrust the mystery _carte_ and _tierce_,
      At whatsoever risk of being defeated:
    The Ghost stopped, menaced, then retired, until
    He reached the ancient wall, then stood stone still.

                      CXX.

    Juan put forth one arm--Eternal powers!
      It touched no soul, nor body, but the wall,
    On which the moonbeams fell in silvery showers,
      Chequered with all the tracery of the Hall;
    He shuddered, as no doubt the bravest cowers
      When he can't tell what 'tis that doth appal.
    How odd, a single hobgoblin's nonentity
    Should cause more fear than a whole host's identity!

                      CXXI.

    But still the Shade remained: the blue eyes glared,
      And rather variably for stony death;
    Yet one thing rather good the grave had spared,
      The Ghost had a remarkably sweet breath:
    A straggling curl showed he had been fair-haired;
      A red lip, with two rows of pearls beneath,
    Gleamed forth, as through the casement's ivy shroud
    The Moon peeped, just escaped from a grey cloud.

                      CXXII.

    And Juan, puzzled, but still curious, thrust
      His other arm forth--Wonder upon wonder!
    It pressed upon a hard but glowing bust,
      Which beat as if there was a warm heart under.
    He found, as people on most trials must,
      That he had made at first a silly blunder,
    And that in his confusion he had caught
    Only the wall, instead of what he sought.

                      CXXIII.

    The Ghost, if Ghost it were, seemed a sweet soul
      As ever lurked beneath a holy hood:
    A dimpled chin,[oh] a neck of ivory, stole
      Forth into something much like flesh and blood;
    Back fell the sable frock and dreary cowl,
      And they revealed--alas! that e'er they should!
    In full, voluptuous, but _not o'er_grown bulk,
    The phantom of her frolic Grace--Fitz-Fulke![812]

{575}[774] The composition of the old Tyrian purple, whether from a
shell-fish, or from cochineal, or from kermes, is still an article of
dispute; and even its colour--some say purple, others scarlet: I say
nothing.

[Kermes is cochineal, the Greek κὀκκινον. [Greek: kokkinon.] The
shell-fish (_murex_) is the _Purpura patula_. Both substances were used
as dyes.]

[779] [Byron loved to make fact and fancy walk together, but, here, his
memory played him false, or his art kept him true. The Black Friar
walked and walks in the Guests' Refectory (or Banqueting Hall, or
"Gallery" of this stanza), which adjoins the Prior's Parlour, but the
room where Byron slept (in a four-post bed-a coronet, at each corner,
atop) is on the floor above the Prior's Parlour, and can only be
approached by a spiral staircase. Both rooms look west, and command a
view of the "lake's billow" and the "cascade." Moreover, the Guests'
Refectory was never hung with "old pictures." It would seem that Don
Juan (perhaps Byron on an emergency) slept in the Prior's Parlour, and
that in the visionary Newstead the pictures forsook the Grand
Drawing-Room for the Hall. Hence the scene! _El Libertado_ steps out of
the Gothic Chamber "forth" into the "gallery," and lo! "a monk in cowl
and beads." But, _Quien sabe?_ The Psalmist's caution with regard to
princes is not inapplicable to poets.]

{578}[781] ["The place," wrote Byron to Moore, August 13, 1814, "is
worth seeing as a ruin, and I can assure you there _was_ some fun there,
even in my time; but that is past. The ghosts, however, and the Gothics,
and the waters, and the desolation, make it very lively still." "It
was," comments Moore (_Life_, p. 262, note 1), "if I mistake not, during
his recent visit to Newstead, that he himself actually fancied he saw
the ghost of the Black Friar, which was supposed to have haunted the
Abbey from the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, and which he
thus describes from the recollection, perhaps, of his own fantasy, in
_Don Juan_.... It is said that the Newstead ghost appeared, also, to
Lord Byron's cousin, Miss Fanny Parkins, and that she made a sketch of
him from memory." The legend of the Black Friar may, it is believed at
Newstead (_et vide post_, "Song," stanza ii. line 5, p. 583), be traced
to the alarm and suspicion of the country-folk, who, on visiting the
Abbey, would now and then catch sight of an aged lay-brother, or monkish
domestic, who had been retained in the service of the Byrons long after
the Canons had been "turned adrift." He would naturally keep out of
sight of a generation who knew not monks, and, when surprised in the
cloisters or ruins of the church, would glide back to his own quarters
in the dormitories.]

{585}[783] I think that it was a carpet on which Diogenes trod,
with--"Thus I trample on the pride of Plato!"--"With greater pride," as
the other replied. But as carpets are meant to be trodden upon, my
memory probably misgives me, and it might be a robe, or tapestry, or a
table-cloth, or some other expensive and uncynical piece of furniture.

[It was Plato's couch or lounge which Diogenes stamped upon. "So much
for Plato's pride!" "And how much for yours, Diogenes?" "Calco Platonis

[785] I remember that the mayoress of a provincial town, somewhat
surfeited with a similar display from foreign parts, did rather
indecorously break through the applauses of an intelligent
audience--intelligent, I mean, as to music--for the words, besides being
in recondite languages (it was some years before the peace, ere all the
world had travelled, and while I was a collegian), were sorely disguised
by the performers:--this mayoress, I say, broke out with, "Rot your
Italianos! for my part, I loves a simple ballat!" Rossini will go a good
way to bring most people to the same opinion some day. Who would imagine
that he was to be the successor of Mozart? However, I state this with
diffidence, as a liege and loyal admirer of Italian music in general,
and of much of Rossini's; but we may say, as the connoisseur did of
painting in _The Vicar of Wakefield_, that "the picture would be better
painted if the painter had taken more pains."

elaborate restoration of the Abbey, which was carried out at a cost of
one hundred thousand pounds (see stanza lix. lines 1, 2). The kitchen
and domestic offices, which extended at right angles to the west front
of the Abbey (see "Newstead from a Picture by Peter Tilleman, _circ._
1720" _Letters_, 1898, i. (to face p.) 216), were pulled down and
rebuilt, the massive Sussex Tower (so named in honour of H.R.H. the Duke
of Sussex) was erected at the south-west corner of the Abbey, and the
south front was, in part, rebuilt and redecorated. Byron had been ready
to "leave everything" with regard to his beloved Newstead to Wildman's
"own feelings, present or future" (see his letter, November 18, 1818,
_Letters_, 1900, iv. 270); but when the time came, the necessary and, on
the whole, judicious alterations of his successor, must have cost the
"banished Lord" many a pang.]

{590}[792] "Ausu Romano, sere Veneto" is the inscription (and well
inscribed in this instance) on the sea walls between the Adriatic and
Venice. The walls were a republican work of the Venetians; the
inscription, I believe, Imperial; and inscribed by Napoleon the _First_.
It is time to continue to him that title--there will be a second by and
by, "Spes altera mundi," _if he live_; let him not defeat it like his
father. But in any case, he will be preferable to "_Imbéciles_." There
is a glorious field for him, if he know how to cultivate it.

stanza lxxxii. line 8) was Foston-le-Clay (Foston, All Saints), near
Barton Hill, Yorkshire, which Lord Chancellor Erskine presented to
Sydney Smith in 1806. The "living" consisted of "three hundred acres of
glebe-land of the stiffest clay," and there was no parsonage house.--See

_Eastern Division_, p. 394, note x.

The devil looked over Lincoln because the unexampled height of the
central tower of the cathedral excited his envy and alarm; or, as Fuller
(_Worthies: Lincolnshire_) has it, "overlooked this church, when first
finished, with a torve and tetrick countenance, as maligning men's
costly devotions." So, at least, the vanity of later ages interpreted
the saying; but a time was when the devil "looked over" Lincoln to some
purpose, for in A.D. 1185 an earthquake clave the Church of Remigius in
twain, and in 1235 a great part of the central tower, which had been
erected by Bishop Hugh de Wells, fell and injured the rest of the
building.]

{601}[803] In French "_mobilité_." I am not sure that mobility is
English; but it is expressive of a quality which rather belongs to other
climates, though it is sometimes seen to a great extent in our own. It
may be defined as an excessive susceptibility of immediate
impressions--at the same time without _losing_ the past: and is, though
sometimes apparently useful to the possessor, a most painful and unhappy
attribute.

["That he was fully aware not only of the abundance of this quality in
his own nature, but of the danger in which it placed consistency and
singleness of character, did not require the note on this passage to
assure us. The consciousness, indeed, of his own natural tendency to
yield thus to every chance impression, and change with every passing
impulse, was not only for ever present in his mind, but ... had the
effect of keeping him in that general line of consistency, on certain
great subjects, which ... he continued to preserve throughout
life."--_Life_, p. 646. "Mobility" is not the tendency to yield to
_every_ impression, to change with _every_ impulse, but the capability
of being moved by many and various impressions, of responding to an
ever-renewed succession of impulses. Byron is defending the enthusiastic
temperament from the charge of inconstancy and insincerity.]

                      I.

    The world is full of orphans: firstly, those
      Who are so in the strict sense of the phrase;
    But many a lonely tree the loftier grows
      Than others crowded in the Forest's maze--
    The next are such as are not doomed to lose
      Their tender parents, in their budding days,
    But, merely, their parental tenderness,
    Which leaves them orphans of the heart no less.

                      II.

    The next are "_only_ Children," as they are styled,
      Who grow up _Children_ only, since th' old saw
    Pronounces that an "only's" a spoilt child--
      But not to go too far, I hold it law,
    That where their education, harsh or mild,
      Transgresses the great bounds of love or awe,
    The sufferers--be 't in heart or intellect--
    Whate'er the _cause_, are orphans in _effect_.

                      III.

    But to return unto the stricter rule--
      As far as words make rules--our common notion
    Of orphan paints at once a parish school,
      A half-starved babe, a wreck upon Life's ocean,
    A human (what the Italians nickname) "Mule!"[814]
      A theme for Pity or some worse emotion;
    Yet, if examined, it might be admitted
    The wealthiest orphans are to be more pitied.

                      IV.

    Too soon they are Parents to themselves: for what
      Are Tutors, Guardians, and so forth, compared
    With Nature's genial Genitors? so that
      A child of Chancery, that Star-Chamber ward,
    (I'll take the likeness I can first come at,)
      Is like--a duckling by Dame Partlett reared,
    And frights--especially if 'tis a daughter,
    Th' old Hen--by running headlong to the water.

                      V.

    There is a common-place book argument,
      Which glibly glides from every tongue;
    When any dare a new light to present,
      "If you are right, then everybody's wrong"!
    Suppose the converse of this precedent
      So often urged, so loudly and so long;
    "If you are wrong, then everybody's right"!
    Was ever everybody yet so quite?

                      VI.

    Therefore I would solicit free discussion
      Upon all points--no matter what, or whose--
    Because as Ages upon Ages push on,
      The last is apt the former to accuse
    Of pillowing its head on a pin-cushion,
      Heedless of pricks because it was obtuse:
    What was a paradox becomes a truth or
    A something like it--witness Luther!

                      VII.

    The Sacraments have been reduced to two,
      And Witches unto none, though somewhat late
    Since burning agéd women (save a few--
      Not witches only b--ches--who create
    Mischief in families, as some know or knew,
      Should still be singed, but lightly, let me state,)
    Has been declared an act of inurbanity,
    _Malgré_ Sir Matthew Hales's great humanity.

                      VIII.

    Great Galileo was debarred the Sun,
      Because he fixed it; and, to stop his talking,
    How Earth could round the solar orbit run,
      Found his own legs embargoed from mere walking:
    The man was well-nigh dead, ere men begun
      To think his skull had not some need of caulking;
    But now, it seems, he's right--his notion just:
    No doubt a consolation to his dust.

                      IX.

    Pythagoras, Locke, Socrates--but pages
      Might be filled up, as vainly as before,
    With the sad usage of all sorts of sages,
      Who in his life-time, each, was deemed a Bore!
    The loftiest minds outrun their tardy ages:
      This they must bear with and, perhaps, much more;
    The wise man's sure when he no more can share it, he
    Will have a firm Post Obit on posterity.

                      X.

    If such doom waits each intellectual Giant,
      We little people in our lesser way,
    In Life's small rubs should surely be more pliant,
      And so for one will I--as well I may--Would
    that I were less bilious--but, oh, fie on 't!
        Just as I make my mind up every day,
    To be a "_totus, teres_," Stoic, Sage,
    The wind shifts and I fly into a rage.

                      XI.

    Temperate I am--yet never had a temper;
      Modest I am--yet with some slight assurance;
    Changeable too--yet somehow "_Idem semper_:"
      Patient--but not enamoured of endurance;
    Cheerful--but, sometimes, rather apt to whimper:
      Mild--but at times a sort of "_Hercules furens_:"
    So that I almost think that the same skin
    For one without--has two or three within.

                      XII.

    Our Hero was, in Canto the Sixteenth,
      Left in a tender moonlight situation,
    Such as enables Man to show his strength
      Moral or physical: on this occasion
    Whether his virtue triumphed--or, at length,
      His vice--for he was of a kindling nation--
    Is more than I shall venture to describe;--
    Unless some Beauty with a kiss should bribe.

                      XIII.

    I leave the thing a problem, like all things:--
      The morning came--and breakfast, tea and toast,
    Of which most men partake, but no one sings.
      The company whose birth, wealth, worth, has cost
    My trembling Lyre already several strings,
      Assembled with our hostess, and mine host;
    The guests dropped in--the last but one, Her Grace,
    The latest, Juan, with his virgin face.

                      XIV.

    Which best it is to encounter--Ghost, or none,
      'Twere difficult to say--but Juan looked
    As if he had combated with more than one,
      Being wan and worn, with eyes that hardly brooked
    The light, that through the Gothic window shone:
      Her Grace, too, had a sort of air rebuked--
    Seemed pale and shivered, as if she had kept
    A vigil, or dreamt rather more than slept.


                        THE END.



FOOTNOTES:

{608}[813] [May 8, 1823.--_MS_. More than one "Seventeenth Canto," or
so-called continuation of _Don Juan_, has been published. Some of these
"Sequels" pretend to be genuine, while others are undisguisedly
imitations or parodies. For an account of these spurious and altogether
worthless continuations, see "Bibliography," vol. vii. There was,
however, a foundation for the myth. Before Byron left Italy he had begun
(May 8, 1823) a seventeenth canto, and when he sailed for Greece he took
the new stanzas with him. Trelawny found "fifteen stanzas of the
seventeenth canto of _Don Juan_" in Byron's room at Missolonghi
(_Recollections, etc._, 1858, p. 237). The MS., together with other
papers, was handed over to John Cam Hobhouse, and is now in the
possession of his daughter, the Lady Dorchester. The copyright was
purchased by the late John Murray. The fourteen (not fifteen) stanzas
are now printed and published for the first time.]

PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.


Of the seventy-three "Epigrams and Jeux d'Esprit," which are printed at
the commencement of this volume, forty-five were included in Murray's
one-volume edition of 1837, eighteen have been collected from various
publications, and ten are printed and published for the first time.

The "Devil's Drive," which appears in Moore's _Letters and Journals_,
and in the sixth volume of the Collected Edition of 1831 as an
"Unfinished Fragment" of ninety-seven lines, is now printed and
published for the first time in its entirety (248 lines), from a MS. in
the possession of the Earl of Ilchester. "A Farewell Petition to J.C.H.
Esq.;" "My Boy Hobbie O;" "[Love and Death];" and "Last Words on
Greece," are reprinted from the first volume of _Murray's Magazine_
(1887).

A few imperfect and worthless poems remain in MS.; but with these and
one or two other unimportant exceptions, the present edition of the
Poetical Works may be regarded as complete.

In compiling a "Bibliography of the successive Editions and Translations
of Lord Byron's Poetical Works," I have endeavoured, in the first
instance, to give a full and particular account of the collected
editions and separate issues of the poems and dramas which were open to
my inspection; and, secondly, to extract from general bibliographies,
catalogues of public and private libraries, and other sources
bibliographical records of editions which I have been unable to examine,
and were known to me only at second-hand. It will be observed that the
_title-pages_ of editions which have passed through my hands are
aligned; the _titles_ of all other editions are italicized.

I cannot pretend that this assortment of bibliographical entries is even
approximately exhaustive; but as "a sample" of a bibliography it will, I
trust, with all its imperfections, be of service to the student of
literature, if not to the amateur or bibliophile. With regard to
nomenclature and other technicalities, my aim has been to put the
necessary information as clearly and as concisely as possible, rather
than to comply with the requirements of this or that formula. But the
path of the bibliographer is beset with difficulties. "Al Sirat's
arch"--"the bridge of breadth narrower than the thread of a famished
spider, and sharper than the edge of a sword" (see _The Giaour_, line
483, _note_ I)--affords an easier and a safer foothold.

To the general reader a bibliography says little or nothing; but, in one
respect, a bibliography of Byron is of popular import. It affords
scientific proof of an almost unexampled fame, of a far-reaching and
still potent influence. Teuton and Latin and Slav have taken Byron to
themselves, and have made him their own. No other English poet except
Shakespeare has been so widely read and so frequently translated. Of
_Manfred_ I reckon one Bohemian translation, two Danish, two Dutch,
three French, nine German, three Hungarian, three Italian, two Polish,
one Romaic, one Roumanian, four Russian, and three Spanish translations,
and, in all probability, there are others which have escaped my net. The
question, the inevitable question, arises--What was, what is, the secret
of Byron's Continental vogue? and why has his fame gone out into all
lands? Why did Goethe enshrine him, in the second part of _Faust_, "as
the representative of the modern era ... undoubtedly to be regarded as
the greatest genius of our century?" (_Conversations of Goethe_, 1874,
p. 265).

It is said, and with truth, that Byron's revolutionary politics
commended him to oppressed nationalities and their sympathizers; that he
was against "the tramplers"--Castlereagh, and the Duke of Wellington,
and the Holy Alliance; that he stood for liberty. Another point in his
favour was his freedom from cant, his indifference to the pieties and
proprieties of the Britannic Muse; that he had the courage of his
opinions. Doubtless in a time of trouble he was welcomed as the champion
of revolt, but deeper reasons must be sought for an almost exclusive
preference for the works of one poet and a comparative indifference to
the works of his rivals and contemporaries. He fulfilled another,
perhaps a greater ideal. An Englishman turns to poetry for the
expression in beautiful words of his happier and better feelings, and he
is not contented unless poetry tends to make him happier or
better--happier because better than he would be otherwise. His favourite
poems are psalms, or at least metrical paraphrases, of life. Men of
other nations are less concerned about their feelings and their souls.
They regard the poet as the creator, the inventor, the maker _par
excellence_, and he who can imagine or make the greatest _eidolon_ is
the greatest poet. _Childe Harold_ and _The Corsair_, _Mazeppa_ and
_Manfred, Cain_ and _Sardanapalus_ were new creations, new types, forms
more real than living man, which appealed to their artistic sense, and
led their imaginations captive. "It is a mark," says Goethe (_Aus meinem
Leben: Dichtung und Wahreit_, 1876, iii. 125), "of true poetry, that, as
a secular gospel, it knows how to free us from the earthly burdens which
press upon us, by inward serenity, by outward charm.... The most lively,
as well as the gravest works have the same end--to moderate both
pleasure and pain through a happy mental representation." It is passion
translated into action, the pageantry of history, the transfiguration
into visible lineaments of living moods and breathing thoughts which are
the notes of this "secular gospel," and for one class of minds work out
a secular redemption.

It was not only the questionable belief that he was on the side of the
people, or his ethical and theological audacities, or his prolonged
Continental exile, which won for Byron a greater name abroad than he has
retained at home; but the character of his poetry. "The English may
think of Byron as they please" (_Conversations of Goethe_, 1874, p.
171), "but this is certain, that they can show no poet who is to be
compared to him. He is different from all the others, and, for the most
part, greater." The English may think of him as they please! and for
them, or some of them, there is "a better oenomel," a _vinum Dæmonum_,
which Byron has not in his gift. The evidence of a world-wide fame will
not endear a poet to a people and a generation who care less for the
matter than the manner of verse, or who _believe_ in poetry as the
symbol or "_credo_" of the imagination or the spirit; but it should
arrest attention and invite inquiry. A bibliography is a dull epilogue
to a poet's works, but it speaks with authority, and it speaks last.
_Finis coronat opus!_

I must be permitted to renew my thanks to Mr. G.F. Barwick,
_Superintendent of the Reading Room_, Mr. Cyril Davenport, and other
officials of the British Museum, of all grades and classes, for their
generous and courteous assistance in the preparation and completion of
the Bibliography. The consultation of many hundreds of volumes of one
author, and the permission to retain a vast number in daily use, have
entailed exceptional labour on a section of the staff. I have every
reason to be grateful.

I am indebted to Mr. A.W. Pollard, of the British Museum, for advice and
direction with regard to bibliographical formulas; to Mr. G.L. Calderon,
late of the staff, for the collection and transcription of the
title-pages of Polish, Russian, and Servian translations; and to Mr. R.
Nisbet Bain for the supervision and correction of the proofs of Slavonic
titles.

To Mr. W.P. Courtney, the author of _Bibliotheca Cornubiensis_, I owe
many valuable hints and suggestions, and the opportunity of consulting
some important works of reference.

I have elsewhere acknowledged the valuable information with regard to
certain rare editions and pamphlets which I have received from Mr. H.
Buxton Forman, C.B.

My especial thanks for laborious researches undertaken on my behalf, and
for information not otherwise attainable, are due to M. J.E. Aynard, of
Lyons; Signor F. Bianco; Professor Max von Förster, of Wurtzburg;
Professor Lajos Gurnesovitz, of Buda Pest; Dr. Holzhausen, of Bonn; Mr.
Leonard Mackall, of Berlin; Miss Peacock; Miss K. Schlesinger; M.
Voynich, of Soho Square; Mr. Theodore Bartholomew, of the University
Library of Cambridge; Mr. T.D. Stewart, of the Croydon Public Library;
and the Librarians of Trinity College, Cambridge, and University
College, St. Andrews.

I have also to thank, for special and generous assistance, Mr. J.P.
Anderson, late of the British Museum, the author of the "Bibliography of
Byron's Works" attached to the Life of Lord Byron by the Hon. Roden Noel
(1890); Miss Grace Reed, of Philadelphia, for bibliographical entries of
early American editions; and Professor Vladimir Hrabar, of the
University of Dorpat, for the collection and transcription of numerous
Russian translations of Byron's Works.

To Messrs. Clowes, the printers of these volumes, and to their reader,
Mr. F.T. Peachey, I am greatly indebted for the transcription of
Slavonic titles included in the Summary of the Bibliography, and for
interesting and useful information during the progress of the work.

In conclusion, I must once more express my acknowment of the industry
and literary ability of my friend Mr. F.E. Taylor, of Chertsey, who has
read the proofs of this and the six preceding volumes.

The Index is the work of Mr. C. Eastlake Smith.

                    EPIGRAM ON AN OLD LADY WHO HAD
              SOME CURIOUS NOTIONS RESPECTING THE SOUL.

    IN Nottingham county there lives at Swan Green,[1]
      As curst an old Lady as ever was seen;
    And when she does die, which I hope will be soon,
      She firmly believes she will go to the Moon!

                                                                     1798.
                   [First published, _Letters and Journals_, 1830, i. 28.]

FOOTNOTES:

[1] "Swan Green" should be "Swine Green." It lay about a quarter of a
mile to the east of St. James's Lane, where Byron lodged in 1799, at the
house of a Mr. Gill. The name appears in a directory of 1799, but by
1815 it had been expunged or changed _euphoniæ gratiâ_. (See _A New Plan
of the Town of Nottingham_, ... 1744.)

Moore took down "these rhymes" from the lips of Byron's nurse, May Gray,
who regarded them as a first essay in the direction of poetry. He
questioned their originality.



                 EPITAPH ON JOHN ADAMS, OF SOUTHWELL,
                 A CARRIER, WHO DIED OF DRUNKENNESS.

    JOHN ADAMS lies here, of the parish of Southwell,
    A _Carrier_ who _carried_ his can to his mouth well;
    He carried so much and he carried so fast,
    He could carry no more--so was carried at last;
    For the liquor he drank being too much for one,
    He could not _carry_ off;--so he's now _carri-on_.

              A VERSION OF OSSIAN'S ADDRESS TO THE SUN.

                       FROM THE POEM "CARTHON."

    O THOU! who rollest in yon azure field,
    Round as the orb of my forefather's shield,
    Whence are thy beams? From what eternal store
    Dost thou, O Sun! thy vast effulgence pour?
    In awful grandeur, when thou movest on high,
    The stars start back and hide them in the sky;
    The pale Moon sickens in thy brightening blaze,
    And in the western wave avoids thy gaze.
    Alone thou shinest forth--for who can rise
    Companion of thy splendour in the skies!
    The mountain oaks are seen to fall away--
    Mountains themselves by length of years decay--
    With ebbs and flows is the rough Ocean tost;
    In heaven the Moon is for a season lost,
    But thou, amidst the fullness of thy joy,
    The same art ever, blazing in the sky!
    When tempests wrap the world from pole to pole,
    When vivid lightnings flash and thunders roll,
    Thou far above their utmost fury borne,
    Look'st forth in beauty, laughing them to scorn.
    But vainly now on me thy beauties blaze--
    Ossian no longer can enraptured gaze!
    Whether at morn, in lucid lustre gay,
    On eastern clouds thy yellow tresses play,
    Or else at eve, in radiant glory drest,
    Thou tremblest at the portals of the west,
    I see no more! But thou mayest fail at length,
    Like Ossian lose thy beauty and thy strength,
    Like him--but for a season--in thy sphere
    To shine with splendour, then to disappear!
    Thy years shall have an end, and thou no more
    Bright through the world enlivening radiance pour,
    But sleep within thy clouds, and fail to rise,
    Heedless when Morning calls thee to the skies!
    Then now exult, O Sun! and gaily shine,
    While Youth and Strength and Beauty all are thine.
    For Age is dark, unlovely, as the light
    Shed by the Moon when clouds deform the night,
    Glimmering uncertain as they hurry past.
    Loud o'er the plain is heard the northern blast,
    Mists shroud the hills, and 'neath the growing gloom,
    The weary traveller shrinks and sighs for home.

                                                                     1806.
                 [First published, _Atlantic Monthly_, December, 1898.][2]

FOOTNOTES:

[2] [I am indebted to the courtesy of Mr. Pierre De La Rose for sending
me a copy of the foregoing _Version of Ossian's Address to the Sun_,
which was "Privately printed at the Press of Oliver B. Graves,
Cambridge, Massachusetts, June the Tenth, MDCCCXCVIII.," and was
reprinted in the _Atlantic Monthly_ in December, 1898. A prefatory note
entitled, "From Lord Byron's Notes," is prefixed to the Version: "In
Lord Byron's copy of _The Poems of Ossian_ (printed by Dewick and
Clarke, London, 1806), which, since 1874, has been in the possession of
the Library of Harvard University as part of the Sumner Bequest. The
notes which follow appear in Byron's hand." (For the _Notes_, see the
_Atlantic Monthly_, 1898, vol. lxxxii. pp. 810-814.)

It is strange that Byron should have made two versions (for another
"version" from the Newstead MSS., see _Poetical Works_, 1898, i.
229-231) of the "Address to the Sun," which forms the conclusion of
"Carthon;" but the Harvard version appears to be genuine. It is to be
noted that Byron appended to the earlier version eighteen lines of his
own composition, by way of moral or application.]



                        LINES TO MR. HODGSON.

                 WRITTEN ON BOARD THE LISBON PACKET.

                                  1.

    HUZZA! Hodgson[3], we are going,
      Our embargo's off at last;
    Favourable breezes blowing
      Bend the canvas o'er the mast.
    From aloft the signal's streaming,
      Hark! the farewell gun is fired;
    Women screeching, tars blaspheming,
      Tell us that our time's expired.
        Here's a rascal
        Come to task all,
      Prying from the Custom-house;
        Trunks unpacking
        Cases cracking,
      Not a corner for a mouse
    Scapes unsearched amid the racket,
    Ere we sail on board the Packet.

                                  2.

    Now our boatmen quit their mooring,
      And all hands must ply the oar;
    Baggage from the quay is lowering,
      We're impatient, push from shore.
    "Have a care! that case holds liquor--
      Stop the boat--I'm sick--oh Lord!"
    "Sick, Ma'am, damme, you'll be sicker,
      Ere you've been an hour on board."
        Thus are screaming
        Men and women,
      Gemmen, ladies, servants, Jacks;
        Here entangling,
        All are wrangling,
      Stuck together close as wax.--
    Such the general noise and racket,
    Ere we reach the Lisbon Packet.

                                  3.

    Now we've reached her, lo! the Captain,
      Gallant Kidd,[4] commands the crew;
    Passengers their berths are clapt in,
      Some to grumble, some to spew.
    "Hey day! call you that a cabin?
      Why't is hardly three feet square!
    Not enough to stow Queen Mab in--
      Who the deuce can harbour there?"
        "Who, sir? plenty--
        Nobles twenty
      Did at once my vessel fill."--
        "Did they? Jesus,
        How you squeeze us!
      Would to God they did so still!
    Then I'd 'scape the heat and racket
    Of the good ship, Lisbon Packet."

                                  4.

    Fletcher! Murray! Bob![5] where are you?
      Stretched along the deck like logs--
    Bear a hand, you jolly tar, you!
      Here's a rope's end for the dogs.
    Hobhouse muttering fearful curses,
      As the hatchway down he rolls,
    Now his breakfast, now his verses,
      Vomits forth--and damns our souls.
        "Here's a stanza[6]
        On Braganza--
      Help!"--"A couplet?"--"No, a cup
        Of warm water--"
        "What's the matter?"
      "Zounds! my liver's coming up;
    I shall not survive the racket
    Of this brutal Lisbon Packet."

                                  5.

    Now at length we're off for Turkey,
      Lord knows when we shall come back!
    Breezes foul and tempests murky
      May unship us in a crack.
    But, since Life at most a jest is,
      As philosophers allow,
    Still to laugh by far the best is,
      Then laugh on--as I do now.
        Laugh at all things,
        Great and small things,
      Sick or well, at sea or shore;
        While we're quaffing,
        Let's have laughing--
      Who the devil cares for more?--
    Some good wine! and who would lack it,
    Ev'n on board the Lisbon Packet?

                      [TO DIVES.[7] A FRAGMENT.]

    UNHAPPY Dives! in an evil hour
      'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
      Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
      Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
      In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
      How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
      But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
      Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

                                                                     1809.

                FAREWELL PETITION TO J.C.H., ESQ^RE^.

    O THOU yclep'd by vulgar sons of Men
    Cam Hobhouse![8] but by wags Byzantian Ben!
    Twin sacred titles, which combined appear
    To grace thy volume's front, and gild its rear,
    Since now thou put'st thyself and work to Sea
    And leav'st all Greece to _Fletcher_[9] and to me,
    Oh, hear my single muse our sorrows tell,
    _One_ song for _self_ and Fletcher quite as well--

    First to the _Castle_ of that man of woes
    Dispatch the letter which _I must_ enclose,
    And when his lone Penelope shall say
    _Why, where_, and _wherefore_ doth my William stay?
    Spare not to move her pity, or her pride--
    By all that Hero suffered, or defied;
    The _chicken's toughness_, and the _lack_ of _ale_
    The _stoney mountain_ and the _miry vale_
    The _Garlick_ steams, which _half_ his meals enrich,
    The _impending vermin_, and the threatened _Itch_,
    That _ever breaking_ Bed, beyond repair!
    The hat too _old_, the coat too _cold_ to wear,
    The Hunger, _which repulsed from Sally's door_
    Pursues her grumbling half from shore to shore,
    Be these the themes to greet his faithful Rib
    So may thy pen be smooth, thy tongue be glib!

    This duty done, let me in turn demand
    Some friendly office in my native land,
    Yet let me ponder well, before I ask,
    And set thee swearing at the tedious task.

    First the Miscellany![10]--to Southwell town
    _Per coach_ for Mrs. _Pigot_ frank it down,
    So may'st them prosper in the paths of Sale,[11]
    And Longman smirk and critics cease to rail.

    All hail to Matthews![12] wash his reverend feet,
    And in my name the man of Method greet,--
    Tell him, my Guide, Philosopher, and Friend,
    Who cannot love me, and who will not mend,
    Tell him, that not in vain I shall assay
    To tread and trace our "old Horatian way,"[13]
    And be (with prose supply my dearth of rhymes)
    What better men have been in better times.

    Here let me cease, for why should I prolong
    My notes, and vex a _Singer_ with a _Song_?
    Oh thou with pen perpetual in thy fist!
    Dubbed for thy sins a stark Miscellanist,
    So pleased the printer's orders to perform
    For Messrs. _Longman_, _Hurst_ and _Rees_ and _Orme_.
    Go--Get thee hence to Paternoster Row,
    Thy patrons wave a duodecimo!
    (Best form for _letters_ from a distant land,
    It fits the pocket, nor fatigues the hand.)
    Then go, once more the joyous work commence[14]
    With stores of anecdote, and grains of sense,
    Oh may Mammas relent, and Sires forgive!
    And scribbling Sons grow dutiful and live!

    Tread lightly--where the bard is laid--
    He cannot mend the shoe he made;
    Yet is he happy in his hole,
    With verse immortal as his _sole_.
    But still to business he held fast,
    And stuck to Phoebus to the _last_.
    Then who shall say so good a fellow
    Was only "leather and prunella?"

           AN ODE[20] TO THE FRAMERS OF THE FRAME BILL.[21]

                                  1.

    OH well done Lord E---- n! and better done R----r![22]
      Britannia must prosper with councils like yours;
    Hawkesbury, Harrowby, help you to guide her,
      Whose remedy only must _kill_ ere it cures:
    Those villains; the Weavers, are all grown refractory,
     Asking some succour for Charity's sake--
    So hang them in clusters round each Manufactory,
      That will at once put an end to _mistake_.[23]

                                  2.

    The rascals, perhaps, may betake them to robbing,
      The dogs to be sure have got nothing to eat--
    So if we can hang them for breaking a bobbin,
      'T will save all the Government's money and meat:
    Men are more easily made than machinery--
      Stockings fetch better prices than lives--
    Gibbets on Sherwood will heighten the scenery,
      Shewing how Commerce, how Liberty thrives!

                                  3.

    Justice is now in pursuit of the wretches,
      Grenadiers, Volunteers, Bow-street Police,
    Twenty-two Regiments, a score of Jack Ketches,
      Three of the Quorum and two of the Peace;
    Some Lords, to be sure, would have summoned the Judges,
      To take their opinion, but that they ne'er shall,
    For LIVERPOOL such a concession begrudges,
      So now they're condemned by _no Judges_ at all.

                                  4.

    Some folks for certain have thought it was shocking,
      When Famine appeals and when Poverty groans,
    That Life should be valued at less than a stocking,
      And breaking of frames lead to breaking of bones.
    If it should prove so, I trust, by this token,
      (And who will refuse to partake in the hope?)
    That the frames of the fools may be first to be _broken_,
      Who, when asked for a _remedy_, sent down a _rope_.

    Hermilda's[31] first and second canto,
    I'm fitting up a new portmanteau;

                                  6.

    And thus to furnish decent lining,
    My own and others' bays I'm twining,--
    So, gentle Thurlow, throw me thine in.

FOOTNOTES:

[30] [One evening, in the late spring or early summer of 1813, Byron and
Moore supped on bread and cheese with Rogers. Their host had just
received from Lord Thurlow [Edward Hovell Thurlow, 1781-1829] a copy of
his _Poems on Several Occasions_ (1813), and Byron lighted upon some
lines to Rogers, "On the Poem of Mr. Rogers, entitled 'An Epistle to a
Friend.'" The first stanza ran thus--

    "When Rogers o'er this labour bent,
    Their purest fire the Muses lent,
    T' illustrate this sweet argument."

"Byron," says Moore, "undertook to read it aloud;--but he found it
impossible to get beyond the first two words. Our laughter had now
increased to such a pitch that nothing could restrain it. Two or three
times he began; but no sooner had the words 'When Rogers' passed his
lips, than our fit burst forth afresh,--till even Mr. Rogers himself ...
found it impossible not to join us. A day or two after, Lord Byron sent
me the following:--'My dear Moore, "When Rogers" must not see the
enclosed, which I send for your perusal.'"--_Life_, p. 181; _Letters_,
1898, ii. 211-213, _note_ 1.]

Thurlow's poems are by no means contemptible. A sonnet, "To a Bird, that
haunted the Water of Lacken, in the Winter," which Charles Lamb
transcribed in one of Coleridge's note-books, should be set over against
the absurd lines, "On the Poems of Mr. Rogers."

    "O melancholy bird, a winter's day
      Thou standest by the margin of the pool;
      And, taught by God, dost thy whole being school
    To Patience, which all evil can allay:
    God has appointed thee the fish thy prey;
      And giv'n thyself a lesson to the fool
      Unthrifty, to submit to moral rule,
    And his unthinking course by thee to weigh.
      There need not schools nor the professor's chair,
    Though these be good, true wisdom to impart;
      He, who has not enough for these to spare
    Of time, or gold, may yet amend his heart,
      And teach his soul by brooks and rivers fair,
    Nature is always wise in every part."

                         TO LORD THURLOW.[32]

        "_I lay my branch of laurel down_."

    "_THOU_ lay thy branch of _laurel_ down!"
      Why, what thou'st stole is not enow;
    And, were it lawfully thine own,
      Does Rogers want it most, or thou?
    Keep to thyself thy withered bough,
      Or send it back to Doctor Donne:[33]
    Were justice done to both, I trow,
      He'd have but little, and thou--none.

                                  2.

        "_Then, thus, to form Apollo's crown_."

    A crown! why, twist it how you will,
    Thy chaplet must be foolscap still.
    When next you visit Delphi's town,
      Enquire amongst your fellow-lodgers,
    They'll tell you Phoebus gave his crown,
      Some years before your birth, to Rogers.

                                  3.

        "_Let every other bring his own_."

    When coals to Newcastle are carried,
      And owls sent to Athens, as wonders,
    From his spouse when the Regent's unmarried,
      Or Liverpool weeps o'er his blunders;
    When Tories and Whigs cease to quarrel,
      When Castlereagh's wife has an heir,
    Then Rogers shall ask us for laurel,
      And thou shalt have plenty to spare.

scraps ['To Lord Thurlow']. The lines in Italics are from the eulogy
that provoked his waggish comments."--_Life_, p. 181. The last stanza of
Thurlow's poem supplied the text--

verses. In the Preface to the second edition of _Poems, etc._, he
writes, "I think that our Poetry has been continually declining since
the days of Milton and Cowley ... and that the golden age of our
language is in the reign of Queen Elizabeth."]



                      THE DEVIL'S DRIVE.[ii][34]

                                  1.

    THE Devil returned to Hell by two,
      And he stayed at home till five;
    When he dined on some homicides done in _ragoût_,
      And a rebel or so in an _Irish_ stew,
    And sausages made of a self-slain Jew,
    And bethought himself what next to do,
      "And," quoth he, "I'll take a drive.
    I walked in the morning, I'll ride to-night;
    In darkness my children take most delight,
      And I'll see how my favourites thrive.                             10

                                  2.

    "And what shall I ride in?" quoth Lucifer, then--
      "If I followed my taste, indeed,
    I should mount in a waggon of wounded men,
      And smile to see them bleed.
    But these will be furnished again and again,
      And at present my purpose is speed;
    To see my manor as much as I may,
    And watch that no souls shall be poached away.

                                  3.

    "I have a state-coach at Carlton House,
      A chariot in Seymour-place;[35]                                    20
    But they're lent to two friends, who make me amends
      By driving my favourite pace:
    And they handle their reins with such a grace,
    I have something for both at the end of the race.

                                  4.

    "So now for the earth to take my chance,"
      Then up to the earth sprung he;
    And making a jump from Moscow to France,
      He stepped across the sea,
    And rested his hoof on a turnpike road,
    No very great way from a Bishop's abode.[36]                         30

                                  5.

    But first as he flew, I forgot to say,
    That he hovered a moment upon his way,
      To look upon Leipsic plain;
    And so sweet to his eye was its sulphury glare,
    And so soft to his ear was the cry of despair,
      That he perched on a mountain of slain;
    And he gazed with delight from its growing height,
    Nor often on earth had he seen such a sight,
      Nor his work done half as well:
    For the field ran so red with the blood of the dead,                 40
      That it blushed like the waves of Hell!
    Then loudly, and wildly, and long laughed he:
    "Methinks they have little need here of _me_!"

                                  6.

    Long he looked down on the hosts of each clime,
      While the warriors hand to hand were--
    Gaul--Austrian and Muscovite heroes sublime,
    And--(Muse of Fitzgerald arise with a rhyme!)
      A quantity of _Landwehr_![37]
          Gladness was there,
    For the men of all might and the monarchs of earth,                  50
    There met for the wolf and the worm to make mirth,
      And a feast for the fowls of the Air!

                                  7.

    But he turned aside and looked from the ridge
      Of hills along the river,
    And the best thing he saw was a broken bridge,[38]
      Which a Corporal chose to shiver;
    Though an Emperor's taste was displeased with his haste,
      The Devil he thought it clever;
    And he laughed again in a lighter strain,
      O'er the torrent swoln and rainy,                                  60
    When he saw "on a fiery steed" Prince Pon,
    In taking care of Number _One_--
    Get drowned with a great _many_!

                                  8.

    But the softest note that soothed his ear
      Was the sound of a widow sighing;
    And the sweetest sight was the icy tear,
    Which Horror froze in the blue eye clear
      Of a maid by her lover lying--
    As round her fell her long fair hair,
    And she looked to Heaven with that frenzied air                      70
    Which seemed to ask if a God were there!
    And stretched by the wall of a ruined hut,
    With its hollow cheek, and eyes half shut,
      A child of Famine dying:
    And the carnage _begun_, when _resistance_ is done,
      And the fall of the vainly flying!

                                  9.

    Then he gazed on a town by besiegers taken,
      Nor cared he who were winning;
    But he saw an old maid, for years forsaken,
      Get up and leave her spinning;                                     80
    And she looked in her glass, and to one that did pass,
    She said--"pray are the rapes beginning?"[39]

                                 10.

    But the Devil has reached our cliffs so white,
      And what did he there, I pray?
    If his eyes were good, he but saw by night
      What we see every day;
    But he made a tour and kept a journal
    Of all the wondrous sights nocturnal,
    And he sold it in shares to the _Men_ of the _Row_,
    Who bid pretty well--but they _cheated_ him, though!                 90

                                 11.

    The Devil first saw, as he thought, the _Mail_,
      Its coachman and his coat;
    So instead of a pistol he cocked his tail,
      And seized him by the throat;
    "Aha!" quoth he, "what have we here?
    'T is a new barouche, and an ancient peer!"[40]

                                 12.

    So he sat him on his box again,
      And bade him have no fear,
    But be true to his club, and staunch to his rein,
      His brothel and his beer;                                         100
    "Next to seeing a Lord at the Council board,
    I would rather see him here."

                                 13.

    Satan hired a horse and gig
      With promises to pay;
    And he pawned his horns for a spruce new wig,
      To redeem as he came away:
    And he whistled some tune, a waltz or a jig,
      And drove off at the close of day.

                                 14.

    The first place he stopped at--he heard the Psalm
      That rung from a Methodist Chapel:                                110
    "'T is the best sound I've heard," quoth he, "since my palm
      Presented Eve her apple!
    When _Faith_ is all, 't is an excellent sign,
    That the _Works_ and Workmen both are mine."

                                 15.

    He passed Tommy Tyrwhitt,[41] that standing jest,
      To princely wit a Martyr:
    But the last joke of all was by far the best,
      When he sailed away with "the Garter"!
    "And"--quoth Satan--"this Embassy's worthy my sight,
    Should I see nothing else to amuse me to night.                     120
    With no one to bear it, but Thomas à Tyrwhitt,
    This ribband belongs to an 'Order of Merit'!"

                                 16.

    He stopped at an Inn and stepped within
      The Bar and read the "Times;"
    And never such a treat, as--the epistle of one "Vetus,"[42]
      Had he found save in downright crimes:
    "Though I doubt if this drivelling encomiast of War
    Ever saw a field fought, or felt a scar,
    Yet his fame shall go farther than he can guess,
    For I'll keep him a place in my _hottest Press_;                    130
    And his works shall be bound in Morocco _d'Enfer_,
    And lettered behind with his _Nom de Guerre_."

                                 17.

    The Devil gat next to Westminster,
      And he turned to "the room" of the Commons;
    But he heard as he purposed to enter in there,
      That "the Lords" had received a summons;
    And he thought, as "a _quondam_ Aristocrat,"
    He might peep at the Peers, though to _hear_ them were flat;
    And he walked up the House so like one of his own,
    That they say that he stood pretty near the throne.                 140

                                 18.

    He saw the Lord Liverpool seemingly wise,
      The Lord Westmoreland certainly silly,
    And Jockey of Norfolk--a man of some size--
      And Chatham, so like his friend Billy;[43]
    And he saw the tears in Lord Eldon's eyes,
      Because the Catholics would _not_ rise,
      In spite of his prayers and his prophecies;
    And he heard--which set Satan himself a staring--
    A certain Chief Justice say something like _swearing_.[44]
    And the Devil was shocked--and quoth he, "I must go,                150
    For I find we have much better manners below.
    If thus he harangues when he passes my border,
    I shall hint to friend Moloch to call him to order."

                                 19.

    Then the Devil went down to the humbler House,
      Where he readily found his way
    As natural to him as its hole to a Mouse,
      He had been there many a day;
    And many a vote and soul and job he
      Had bid for and carried away from the Lobby:
    But there now was a "call" and accomplished debaters                160
    Appeared in the glory of hats, boots and gaiters--
    _Some_ paid rather more--but _all_ worse dressed
          than Waiters!

                                 20.

    There was Canning for War, and Whitbread for peace,
      And others as suited their fancies;
    But all were agreed that our debts should increase
      Excepting the Demagogue Francis.
    That rogue! how could Westminster chuse him again
      To leaven the virtue of these honest men!
    But the Devil remained till the Break of Day
      Blushed upon Sleep and Lord Castlereagh:[45]                      170
    Then up half the house got, and Satan got up
      With the drowsy to snore--or the hungry to sup:--
    But so torpid the power of some speakers, 't is said,
    That they sent even him to his brimstone bed.

                                 21.

    He had seen George Rose--but George was grown dumb,
       And only lied in thought![46]
    And the Devil has all the pleasure to come
      Of hearing him talk as he ought.
    With the falsest of tongues, the sincerest of men--
      His veracity were but deceit--                                    180
    And Nature must first have unmade him again,
    Ere his breast or his face, or his tongue, or his pen,
    Conceived--uttered--looked--or wrote down letters ten,
    Which Truth would acknowledge complete.

                                 22.

    Satan next took the army list in hand,
      Where he found a new "Field Marshal;"
    And when he saw this high command
      Conferred on his Highness of Cumberland,[47]
    "Oh! were I prone to cavil--or were I not the Devil,
      I should say this was somewhat partial;                           190
    Since the only wounds that this Warrior gat,
    Were from God knows whom--and the Devil knows what!"

                                 23.

    He then popped his head in a royal Ball,
      And saw all the Haram so hoary;
    And who there besides but Corinna de Staël![48]
      Turned Methodist and Tory!
    "Aye--Aye"--quoth he--"'t is the way with them all,
      When Wits grow tired of Glory:
    But thanks to the weakness, that thus could pervert her,
    Since the dearest of prizes to me's a deserter:                     200
    _Mem_--whenever a sudden conversion I want,
    To send to the school of Philosopher Kant;
    And whenever I need a critic who can gloss over
    All faults--to send for Mackintosh to write up the Philosopher."[49]

                                 24.

    The Devil waxed faint at the sight of this Saint,
      And he thought himself of eating;
    And began to cram from a plate of ham
      Wherewith a Page was retreating--
    Having nothing else to do (for "the friends" each so near
      Had sold all their souls long before),                            210
    As he swallowed down the bacon he wished himself a Jew
      For the sake of another crime more:
    For Sinning itself is but half a recreation,
    Unless it ensures most infallible Damnation.

                                 25.

    But he turned him about, for he heard a sound
      Which even his ear found faults in;
    For whirling above--underneath--and around--
      Were his fairest Disciples Waltzing![50]
    And quoth he--"though this be--the _premier pas_ to me,
      Against it I would warn all--                                     220
    Should I introduce these revels among my younger devils,
      They would all turn perfectly carnal:
    And though fond of the flesh--yet I never could bear it
    Should quite in my kingdom get the upper hand of Spirit."

                                 26.

    The Devil (but 't was over) had been vastly glad
      To see the new Drury Lane,
    And yet he might have been rather mad
      To see it rebuilt in vain;
    And had he beheld their "Nourjahad,"[51]
      Would never have gone again:                                      230
    And Satan had taken it much amiss,
    They should fasten such a piece on a friend of his--
    Though he knew that his works were somewhat sad,
    He never had found them _quite_ so bad:
    For this was "the book" which, of yore, Job, sorely smitten,
    Said, "Oh that _mine_ enemy, _mine_ enemy had written"!

                                 27.

    Then he found sixty scribblers in separate cells,[52]
      And marvelled what they were doing,
    For they looked like little fiends in their own little hells,
      Damnation for others brewing--                                    240
    Though their paper seemed to shrink, from the heat of their ink,
      They were only _coolly_ reviewing!
    And as one of them wrote down the pronoun "_We_,"
      "That Plural"--says Satan--"means _him_ and _me_,
    With the Editor added to make up the three
    Of an Athanasian Trinity,
    And render the believers in our 'Articles' sensible,
    How many must combine to form _one_ Incomprehensible"!

[34] ["I have lately written a wild, rambling, unfinished rhapsody,
called 'The Devil's Drive,' the notion of which I took from Porson's
_Devil's Walk_."--_Journal_, December 17, 18, 1813, _Letters_, 1898, ii.
378. "Though with a good deal of vigour and imagination, it is," says
Moore, "for the most part rather clumsily executed, wanting the point
and condensation of those clever verses of Coleridge and Southey, which
Lord Byron, adopting a notion long prevalent, has attributed to Porson."
The _Devil's Walk_ was published in the _Morning Post_, September 6,
1799. It has been published under Porson's name (1830, ed. H. Montague,
illustrated by Cruikshank). (See _Poetical Works_, 1898, i. 30, _note_
1.)]

[35] [Lord Yarmouth, nicknamed "Red Herrings," the eldest son of the
Regent's elderly favourite, the Marchioness of Hertford (the "Marchesa"
of the _Twopenny Post-Bag_), lived at No. 7, Seamore Place, Mayfair.
Compare Moore's "Epigram:" "'I want the Court Guide,' said my lady, 'to
look If the House, Seymour Place, be at 30 or 20,'" etc.--_Poetical
Works_, 1850, p. 165.]

[36] [The allusion may be to a case which was before the courts, the
Attorney-General _v_. William Carver and Brownlow Bishop of Winchester
(see _Morning Chronicle_, November 17, 1813). Carver held certain
premises under the Bishop of Winchester, at the entrance of Portsmouth
Harbour, which obstructed the efflux and reflux of the tide. "The fact,"
said Mr. Serjeant Lens, in opening the case for the Crown, "was of great
magnitude to the entire nation, since it effected the security, and even
the existence of one of the principal harbours of Great Britain."]

[37] [The Russian and Austrian troops at the battle of Leipsic, October
16, 1813, were, for the most part, veterans, while the Prussian
contingent included a large body of militia.]

[38] [For the incident of the "broken bridge" Byron was indebted to the
pages of the _Morning Chronicle_ of November 8, 1813, "Paris Papers,
October 30"--

"The Emperor had ordered the engineers to form fougades under the grand
bridge which is between Leipsic and Lindenau, in order to blow it up at
the latest moment, and thus to retard the march of the enemy and give
time to our baggage to file off. General Dulauloy had entrusted the
operation to Colonel Montford. The Colonel, instead of remaining on the
spot to direct it, and to give the signal, ordered a corporal and four
sappers to blow up the bridge the instant the enemy should appear. The
corporal, an ignorant fellow, and ill comprehending the nature of the
duty with which he was charged, upon hearing the first shot discharged
from the ramparts of the city, set fire to the fougades and blew up the
bridge. A part of the army was still on the other side, with a park of
80 pieces of artillery and some hundreds of waggons. The advance of this
part of the army, who were approaching the bridge, seeing it blow up,
conceived it was in the power of the enemy. A cry of dismay spread from
rank to rank. 'The enemy are close upon our rear, and the bridges are
destroyed!' The unfortunate soldiers dispersed, and endeavoured to
effect their escape as well as they could. The Duke of Tarentum swam
across the river. Prince Poniatowsky, mounted on a spirited horse,
darted into the water and appeared no more. The Emperor was not informed
of this disaster until it was too late to remedy it.... Colonel Montfort
and the corporal of the sappers have been handed over to a
court-martial."]

[39] [Compare _Don Juan_, Canto VIII. stanza cxxxii. line 4. Sir Walter
Scott (_Journal_, October 30, 1826 [1890, i. 288]), tells the same story
of "an old woman who, when Carlisle was taken by the Highlanders in
1745, chose to be particularly apprehensive of personal violence, and
shut herself up in a closet, in order that she might escape ravishment.
But no one came to disturb her solitude, and ... by and by she popped
her head out of her place of refuge with the pretty question, 'Good
folks, can you tell me when the ravishing is going to begin?'" In 1813
Byron did not know Scott, and must have stolen the jest from some older
writer. It is, probably, of untold antiquity.]

[40] [The "Four-Horse" Club, founded in 1808, was incorrectly styled the
Four-in-Hand Club, and the Barouche Club. According to the Club rules,
the barouches were "yellow-bodied, with 'dickies,' the horses bay, with
rosettes at their heads, and the harness silver-mounted. The members
wore a drab coat reaching to the ankles, with three tiers of pockets,
and mother-o'-pearl buttons as large as five-shilling pieces. The
waistcoat was blue, with yellow stripes an inch wide; breeches of plush,
with strings and rosettes to each knee; and it was _de rigueur_ that the
hat should be 3-1/2 inches deep in the crown." (See _Driving_, by the
Duke of Beaufort, K.G., 1894, pp. 251-258.)

The "ancient peer" may possibly be intended for the President of the
Club, Philip Henry, fifth Earl of Chesterfield (1755-1815), who was a
member of the Privy Council, and had been Postmaster-General and Master
of the Horse.]

[41] [Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt (_circ_. 1762-1833) was the son of the Rev.
Edmund Tyrwhitt, Rector of Wickham Bishops, etc., and nephew of Thomas
Tyrwhitt, the editor of the _Canterbury Tales_. He was Private Secretary
to the Prince of Wales, auditor of the Duchy of Cornwall (1796), and
Lord Warden of the Stannaries (1805). He was knighted May 8, 1812. He
was sent in the following year in charge of the Garter mission to the
Czar, and on that occasion was made a Knight of the Imperial Order of
St. Anne, First Class. He held the office of Gentleman Usher of the
Black Rod, 1812-1832. "Tommy Tyrwhitt" was an important personage at
Carlton House, and shared with Colonel McMahon the doubtful privilege of
being a confidential servant of the Prince Regent. Compare Letter III.
of Moore's _Twopenny Post-Bag_, 1813, p. 12. "From G.R. to the E. of
Y----th."

    "I write this in bed while my whiskers are airing,
    And M--c has a sly dose of jalap preparing
    For poor T--mm--y T--rr--t at breakfast to quaff--
    As I feel I want something to give me a laugh,
    And there's nothing so good as old T--mm--y kept close
    To his Cornwall accounts, after taking a dose!"

See _Gentleman's Magazine_, March, 1833, vol. 103, pt. i. pp. 275, 276.]

[42] ["Vetus" [Edward Sterling] contributed a series of letters to the
_Times_, 1812, 1813. They were afterwards republished. Vetus was not a
Little Englander, and his political sentiments recall the _obiter dicta_
of contemporary patriots; _e.g._ "the only legitimate basis for a
treaty, if not on the part of the Continental Allies, at least for
England herself [is] that she should conquer all she can, and keep all
she conquers. This is not by way of retaliation, however just, upon so
obdurate and rapacious an enemy--but as an indispensable condition of
her own safety and existence." The letters were reviewed under the
heading of "Illustrations of Vetus," in the _Morning Chronicle_,
December 2, 10, 16, 18; 1813. The reviewer and Byron did not take the
patriotic view of the situation.]

[43] [Robert Banks Jenkinson (1770-1828), second Earl of Liverpool, on
the assassination of Perceval, became Prime Minister, June 7, 1812; John
Fane (1759-1841), tenth Earl of Westmoreland, was Lord Privy Seal,
1798-1827; Charles Howard (1746-1815), eleventh Duke of Norfolk, known
as "Jockey of Norfolk," was a Protestant and a Liberal, and at one time
a friend of the Prince of Wales. Wraxall, _Posthumous Memoirs_, 1836, i.
29, says that "he might have been mistaken for a grazier or a butcher by
his dress and appearance." He figures _largely_ in Gillray, see _e.g._
"Meeting of the Moneyed Interest," December, 1798. John Pitt
(1756-1835), second Earl of Chatham, the hero of the abortive Walcheren
expedition, had been made a general in the army January 1, 1812. He
"inherited," says Wraxall, _ibid._, iii. 129, "his illustrious father's
form and figure; but not his mind."]

[44] [Edward Law (1750-1818), first Baron Ellenborough, Lord Chief
Justice of the King's Bench, 1802-18, was given to the use of strong
language. His temper (see Moore's "Sale of the Tools") was "none of the
best." On one occasion, speaking in the House of Lords (March 22, 1813)
with regard to the "delicate investigation," he asserted that the
accusation ["that the persons intrusted had thought fit to fabricate an
unauthorized document"] "was as false as hell;" and by way of protest
against the tedious harangues of old Lord Darnley, "I am answerable to
God for my time, and what account can I give at the day of judgment if I
stay here longer?"]

[45] [Compare Moore's "Insurrection of the Papers"--

    "Last night I toss'd and turn'd in bed,
    But could not sleep--at length I said,
    'I'll think of Viscount C--stl--r--gh,
    And of his speeches--that's the way.'"]

[46] [George Rose (1744-1818) was at this time Treasurer of the Navy.
Wraxall, who quotes the "Probationary Odes" with regard to his alleged
duplicity, testifies that he "knew him well in his official capacity,
during at least twelve years, and never found him deficient in honour or
sincerity" (_Posthumous Memoirs_, 1836, i. 148). Moore ("Parody of a
Celebrated Letter") makes the Regent conceive how shocked the king would
be to wake up sane and find "that R--se was grown honest, or
W--stm--rel--nd wiser."]

[47] [Ernest Augustus (1771-1851), Duke of Cumberland and King of
Hanover, fifth son of George III., was gazetted as Field-Marshal
November 27, 1813. His "wounds," which, according to the Duke's sworn
testimony, were seventeen in number, were inflicted during an encounter
with his valet, Joseph Sellis (? Sélis), a Piedmontese, who had
attempted to assassinate the Prince (June 1, 1810), and, shortly
afterwards, was found with his throat cut. A jury of Westminster
tradesmen brought in a verdict of _felo de se_ against Sellis. The event
itself and the trial before the coroner provoked controversy and the
grossest scandal. The question is discussed and the Duke exonerated of
the charges brought against him, by J.H. Jesse, _Memoirs, etc., of
George III._, 1864, iii. 545, 546, and by George Rose, _Diaries, etc._,
1860, ii. 437-446. The scandal was revived in 1832 by the publication of
a work entitled _The Authentic Memoirs of the Court of England for the
last Seventy Years._ The printer and publisher of the work was found
guilty. (See _The Trial of Josiah Phillips for a Libel on the Duke of
Cumberland_, 1833.)]

[48] ["At half-past nine [Wednesday, December 8, 1813] there was a grand
dress party at Carlton House, at which her Majesty and the Prince Regent
most graciously received the following distinguished characters from the
Russian Court, viz. the Count and Countess Leiven, Mad. La Barrone
(_sic_) de Staël, Monsieur de Staël," etc.--_Morning Chronicle_,
December 10, 1813.]

[49] [In the review of Madame de Staël's _De L'Allemagne_ (_Edinburgh
Review_, October, 1813, vol. 22, pp. 198-238), Sir James Mackintosh
enlarged upon and upheld the "opinions of Kant" as creative and seminal
in the world of thought. In the same article he passes in review the
systems of Hobbes, Paley, Bentham, Reid, etc., and finds words of praise
and admiration for each in turn. See, too, a passage (p. 226) in which
he alludes to Coleridge as a living writer, whose "singular character
and unintelligible style" might, in any other country but England, have
won for him attention if not approval. His own "conversion" from the
extreme liberalism of the _Vindiciæ Gallicæ_ of 1791 to the philosophic
conservatism of the _Introductory Discourse_ (1798) to his lecture on
_The Law of Nature and Nations_, was regarded with suspicion by
Wordsworth and Coleridge, who, afterwards, were still more effectually
"converted" themselves.]

Frances Sheridan, _née_ Chamberlaine, 1724-1766), was played for the
first time at Drury Lane Theatre, November 25, 1813. Byron was
exceedingly indignant at being credited with the authorship or
adaptation. (See Letter to Murray, November 27, 1813, _Letters_, 1898,
ii. 288, _note_ 1.) Miss Sophia Lee, who wrote some of the _Canterbury
Tales_, "made a very elegant musical drama of it" (_Memoirs of Mrs. F.

The discovery "that King Charles I. was buried in the vault of King
Henry VIII.," was made on completing the mausoleum which George III.
caused to be built in the tomb-house. The Prince Regent was informed of
the circumstance, and on April 1, 1813, the day after the funeral of his
mother-in-law, the Duchess of Brunswick, he superintended in person the
opening of the leaden coffin, which bore the inscription, "King Charles,
1648" (_sic_). See _An Account of what appeared on Opening the Coffin of

                         CONDOLATORY ADDRESS

         TO SARAH COUNTESS OF JERSEY, ON THE PRINCE REGENT'S
                RETURNING HER PICTURE TO MRS. MEE.[56]

    WHEN the vain triumph of the imperial lord,
    Whom servile Rome obeyed, and yet abhorred,
    Gave to the vulgar gaze each glorious bust,
    That left a likeness of the brave, or just;
    What most admired each scrutinising eye
    Of all that decked that passing pageantry?
    What spread from face to face that wondering air?
    The thought of Brutus[57]--for his was not there!
    That absence proved his worth,--that absence fixed
    His memory on the longing mind, unmixed;                             10
    And more decreed his glory to endure,
    Than all a gold Colossus could secure.

    If thus, fair Jersey, our desiring gaze
    Search for thy form, in vain and mute amaze,
    Amidst those pictured charms, whose loveliness,
    Bright though they be, thine own had rendered less:
    If he, that VAIN OLD MAN, whom truth admits
    Heir of his father's crown, and of his wits,
    If his corrupted eye, and withered heart,
    Could with thy gentle image bear to part;                            20
    That tasteless shame be _his_, and ours the grief,
    To gaze on Beauty's band without its chief:
    Yet Comfort still one selfish thought imparts,
    We lose the portrait, but preserve our hearts.

    What can his vaulted gallery now disclose?
    A _garden_ with all flowers--except the rose;--
    A _fount_ that only wants its living stream;
    A _night_, with every star, save Dian's beam.
    Lost to our eyes the present forms shall be,
    That turn from tracing them to dream of thee;                        30
    And more on that recalled resemblance pause,
    Than all he _shall_ not force on our applause.

    Long may thy yet meridian lustre shine,
    With all that Virtue asks of Homage thine:
    The symmetry of youth--the grace of mien--
    The eye that gladdens--and the brow serene;
    The glossy darkness of that clustering hair,[58]
    Which shades, yet shows that forehead more than fair!
    Each glance that wins us, and the life that throws
    A spell which will not let our looks repose,                         40
    But turn to gaze again, and find anew
    Some charm that well rewards another view.
    These are not lessened, these are still as bright,
    Albeit too dazzling _for a dotard's sight_;
    And those must wait till ev'ry charm is gone,
    To please the paltry heart that pleases none;--
    That dull cold sensualist, whose sickly eye
    In envious dimness passed thy portrait by;
    Who racked his little spirit to combine
    Its hate of _Freedom's_ loveliness, and _thine_.                     50

               FRAGMENT OF AN EPISTLE TO THOMAS MOORE.

    "WHAT say _I_?"--not a syllable further in prose;
    I'm your man "of all measures," dear Tom,--so here goes!
    Here goes, for a swim on the stream of old Time,
    On those buoyant supporters, the bladders of rhyme.
    If our weight breaks them down, and we sink in the flood,
    We are smothered, at least, in respectable mud,
    Where the divers of Bathos lie drowned in a heap,
    And Southey's last Pæan has pillowed his sleep;
    That _Felo de se_ who, half drunk with his Malmsey,
    Walked out of his depth and was lost in a calm sea,                  10
    Singing "Glory to God" in a spick and span stanza,
    The like (since Tom Sternhold was choked) never man saw.[59]

    The papers have told you, no doubt, of the fusses,
    The fêtes, and the gapings to get at these Russes,[60]--
    Of his Majesty's suite, up from coachman to Hetman,--
    And what dignity decks the flat face of the great man.
    I saw him, last week, at two balls and a party,--
    For a Prince, his demeanour was rather too hearty.
    You know, _we_ are used to quite different graces,

           *       *       *       *       *

    The Czar's look, I own, was much brighter and brisker,               20
    But then he is sadly deficient in whisker;
    And wore but a starless blue coat, and in kersey-
    mere breeches whisked round, in a waltz with the Jersey,[61]
    Who, lovely as ever, seemed just as delighted
    With Majesty's presence as those she invited.

From June 6 to June 27, 1814, the Emperor of Russia, and the King of
Prussia were in England. Huge crowds watched all day and night outside
the Pulteney Hotel (105, Piccadilly), where the Emperor of Russia
stayed. Among the foreigners in London were Nesselrode, Metternich,
Blücher, and Platoff, Hetman of the Cossacks. The two latter were the
heroes of the mob. _Ibid_., p. 93, _note_ 1.]

frame-breakers, and then to the disaffected in general. It was derived
from a half-witted lad named Ned Lud, who entered a house in a fit of
passion, and destroyed a couple of stocking-frames. The song was an
impromptu, enclosed in a letter to Moore of December 24, 1816. "I have
written it principally," he says, "to shock your neighbour [Hodgson?]

             EPISTLE FROM MR. MURRAY TO DR. POLIDORI.[75]

    DEAR Doctor, I have read your play,
    Which is a good one in its way,--
    Purges the eyes, and moves the bowels,
    And drenches handkerchiefs like towels
    With tears, that, in a flux of grief,
    Afford hysterical relief
    To shattered nerves and quickened pulses,
    Which your catastrophe convulses.

      I like your moral and machinery;
    Your plot, too, has such scope for Scenery!                          10
    Your dialogue is apt and smart;
    The play's concoction full of art;
    Your hero raves, your heroine cries,
    All stab, and every body dies.
    In short, your tragedy would be
    The very thing to hear and see:
    And for a piece of publication,
    If I decline on this occasion,
    It is not that I am not sensible
    To merits in themselves ostensible,                                  20
    But--and I grieve to speak it--plays
    Are drugs--mere drugs, Sir--now-a-days.
    I had a heavy loss by _Manuel_--[76]
    Too lucky if it prove not annual,--
    And Sotheby, with his _Orestes_,[77]
    (Which, by the way, the old Bore's best is),
    Has lain so very long on hand,
    That I despair of all demand;
    I've advertised, but see my books,
    Or only watch my Shopman's looks;--                                  30
    Still _Ivan_, _Ina_,[78] and such lumber,
    My back-shop glut, my shelves encumber.

    There's Byron too, who once did better,
    Has sent me, folded in a letter,
    A sort of--it's no more a drama
    Than _Darnley_, _Ivan_, or _Kehama_;
    So altered since last year his pen is,
    I think he's lost his wits at Venice.

           *       *       *       *       *

           *       *       *       *       *

    In short, Sir, what with one and t' other,
    I dare not venture on another.                                       40
    I write in haste; excuse each blunder;
    The Coaches through the street so thunder!
    My room's so full--we've Gifford here
    Reading MS., with Hookham Frere,
    Pronouncing on the nouns and particles,
    Of some of our forthcoming Articles.

      The _Quarterly_--Ah, Sir, if you
    Had but the Genius to review!--
    A smart Critique upon St. Helena,
    Or if you only would but tell in a                                   50
    Short compass what--but to resume;
    As I was saying, Sir, the Room--
    The Room's so full of wits and bards,
    Crabbes, Campbells, Crokers, Freres, and Wards
    And others, neither bards nor wits:
    My humble tenement admits
    All persons in the dress of Gent.,
    From Mr. Hammond to Dog Dent.[79]

      A party dines with me to-day,
    All clever men, who make their way:                                  60
    Crabbe, Malcolm,[80] Hamilton,[81] and Chantrey,
    Are all partakers of my pantry.
    They're at this moment in discussion
    On poor De Staël's late dissolution.
    Her book,[82] they say, was in advance--
    Pray Heaven, she tell the truth of France!
    'T is said she certainly was married
    To Rocca, and had twice miscarried,
    No--not miscarried, I opine,--
    But brought to bed at forty-nine.                                    70
    Some say she died a Papist; some
    Are of opinion that's a Hum;
    I don't know that--the fellows Schlegel,[83]
    Are very likely to inveigle
    A dying person in compunction
    To try th' extremity of Unction.
    But peace be with her! for a woman
    Her talents surely were uncommon,
    Her Publisher (and Public too)
    The hour of her demise may rue--                                     80
    For never more within his shop he--
    Pray--was not she interred at Coppet?
    Thus run our time and tongues away;--
    But, to return, Sir, to your play:
    Sorry, Sir, but I cannot deal,
    Unless 't were acted by O'Neill.
    My hands are full--my head so busy,
    I'm almost dead--and always dizzy;
    And so, with endless truth and hurry,
    Dear Doctor, I am yours,                                             90

return of post a _delicate_ declension of it, which I engage faithfully
to copy."

"I never," said Byron, "was much more disgusted with any human
production than with the eternal nonsense, and _tracasseries_, and
emptiness, and ill-humour, and vanity of this young person; but he has
some talent, and is a man of honour, and has dispositions of amendment.
Therefore use your interest for him, for he is improved and improvable;"

_Anti-Jacobin_ and the _Quarterly Review_. In the drawing-room of

      To set up this ultimate Canto;[84]
    But (if they don't rob us)
    You'll see Mr. Hobhouse
      Will bring it safe in his portmanteau.

                                  2.

    For the Journal you hint of,[85]
    As ready to print off,
      No doubt you do right to commend it;
    But as yet I have writ off
    The devil a bit of
      Our "Beppo:"--when copied, I'll send it.

                                  3.

    In the mean time you've "Galley"[86]
    Whose verses all tally,
      Perhaps you may say he's a Ninny,
    But if you abashed are
    Because of _Alashtar_,
      He'll piddle another _Phrosine_.[87]

                                  4.

    Then you've Sotheby's Tour,--[88]
    No great things, to be sure,--
      You could hardly begin with a less work;
    For the pompous rascallion,
    Who don't speak Italian
      Nor French, must have scribbled by guess-work.

                                  5.

    No doubt he's a rare man
    Without knowing German
      Translating his way up Parnassus,
    And now still absurder
    He meditates Murder
      As you'll see in the trash he calls _Tasso's_.

                                  6.

    But you've others his betters
    The real men of letters
      Your Orators--Critics--and Wits--
    And I'll bet that your Journal
    (Pray is it diurnal?)
      Will pay with your luckiest hits.

                                  7.

    You can make any loss up
    With "Spence"[89] and his gossip,
      A work which must surely succeed;
    Then Queen Mary's Epistle-craft,[90]
    With the new "Fytte" of "Whistlecraft,"
      Must make people purchase and read.

                                  8.

    Then you've General Gordon,[91]
    Who girded his sword on,
      To serve with a Muscovite Master,
    And help him to polish
    A nation so owlish,
      They thought shaving their beards a disaster.

                                  9.

    For the man, "_poor and shrewd_,"[92]
    With whom you'd conclude
      A compact without more delay,
    Perhaps some such pen is
    Still extant in Venice;
      But please, Sir, to mention _your pay_.

                                 10.

    Now tell me some news
    Of your friends and the Muse,
      Of the Bar, or the Gown, or the House,
    From Canning, the tall wit,
    To Wilmot,[93] the small wit,
      Ward's creeping Companion and _Louse_,

                                 11.

    Who's so damnably bit
    With fashion and Wit,
      That he crawls on the surface like Vermin,
    But an Insect in both,--
    By his Intellect's growth,
      Of what size you may quickly determine.[94]

    The list concludes John Murray's columns:
    Of these there have been few translations[97]
    For Gallic or Italian nations;
    And one or two perhaps in German--
    But in this last I can't determine.
    But then I only sung of passions
    That do not suit with modern fashions;
    Of Incest and such like diversions
    Permitted only to the Persians,
    Or Greeks to bring upon their stages--
    But that was in the earlier ages
    Besides my style is the romantic,
    Which some call fine, and some call frantic;
    While others are or would seem _as_ sick
    Of repetitions nicknamed Classic.
    For my part all men must allow
    Whatever I was, I'm classic now.
    I saw and left my fault in time,
    And chose a topic all sublime--
    Wondrous as antient war or hero--
    Then played and sung away like Nero,
    Who sang of Rome, and I of Rizzo:
    The subject has improved my wit so,
    The first four lines the poet sees
    Start forth in fourteen languages!
    Though of seven volumes none before
    Could ever reach the fame of four,
    Henceforth I sacrifice all Glory
    To the Rinaldo of my Story:
    I've sung his health and appetite
    (The last word's not translated right--
    He's turned it, God knows how, to vigour)[98]
    I'll sing them in a book that's bigger.
    Oh! Muse prepare for thy Ascension!
    And generous Rizzo! thou my pension.

                            TO MR. MURRAY.

                                  1.

    Strahan, Tonson, Lintot of the times,[99]
    Patron and publisher of rhymes,
    For thee the bard up Pindus climbs,
                          My Murray.


                                  2.

    To thee, with hope and terror dumb,
    The unfledged MS. authors come;
    Thou printest all--and sellest some--
                          My Murray.

                                  3.

    Upon thy table's baize so green
    The last new Quarterly is seen,--
    But where is thy new Magazine,[100]
                          My Murray?

                                  4.

    Along thy sprucest bookshelves shine
    The works thou deemest most divine--
    The Art of Cookery,[101] and mine,
                          My Murray.

                                  5.

    Tours, Travels, Essays, too, I wist,
    And Sermons, to thy mill bring grist;
    And then thou hast the _Navy List_,
                          My Murray.


                                  6.

    And Heaven forbid I should conclude,
    Without "the Board of Longitude,"[102]
    Although this narrow paper would,
                          My Murray.

Gibbon's _Decline and Fall_, Cook's _Voyages, etc_. He was
great-grandfather of the mathematician William Spottiswoode (1825-1883).

Jacob Tonson (1656?-1736) published for Otway, Dryden, Addison, etc. He
was secretary of the Kit-Cat Club, 1700. He was the publisher (1712,
etc.) of the _Spectator_.

Barnaby Bernard Lintot (1675-1736) was at one time (1718) in partnership
with Tonson. He published Pope's _Iliad_ in 1715, and the _Odyssey_,

[101] [Mrs. Rundell's _Domestic Cookery_, published in 1806, was one of
Murray's most successful books. In 1822 he purchased the copyright from
Mrs. Rundell for £2000 (see _Letters_, 1898, ii. 375; and _Memoir of
John Murray_, 1891, ii. 124).]

[102] [The sixth edition of _Childe Harold's Pilgrimage_ (1813) was
"printed by T. Davison, Whitefriars, for John Murray, Bookseller to the
Admiralty, and the Board of Longitude." Medwin (_Conversations_, 1824,
p. 259) attributes to Byron a statement that Murray had to choose
between continuing to be his publisher and printing the "Navy Lists,"
and "that there was no hesitation which way he should decide: the
Admiralty carried the day." In his "Notes" to the _Conversations_
(November 2, 1824) Murray characterized "the passage about the
Admiralty" as "unfounded in fact, and no otherwise deserving of notice
than to mark its absurdity."]



         BALLAD. TO THE TUNE OF "SALLEY IN OUR ALLEY."

                                  1.

    OF all the twice ten thousand bards
      That ever penned a canto,
    Whom Pudding or whom Praise rewards
      For lining a portmanteau;
    Of all the poets ever known,
      From Grub-street to Fop's Alley,[103]
    The Muse may boast--the World must own
      There's none like pretty Gally![104]

                                  2.

    He writes as well as any Miss,
      Has published many a poem;
    The shame is yours, the gain is his,
      In case you should not know 'em:
    He has ten thousand pounds a year--
      I do not mean to vally--
    His songs at sixpence would be dear,
      So give them gratis, Gaily!

                                  3.

    And if this statement should seem queer,
      Or set down in a hurry,
    Go, ask (if he will be sincere)
      His bookseller--John Murray.
    Come, say, how many have been sold,
      And don't stand shilly-shally,
    Of bound and lettered, red and gold,
      Well printed works of Gally.

                                  4.

    For Astley's circus Upton[105] writes,
      And also for the Surry; (_sic_)
    Fitzgerald weekly still recites,
      Though grinning Critics worry:
    Miss Holford's Peg, and Sotheby's Saul,
      In fame exactly tally;
    From Stationer's Hall to Grocer's Stall
      They go--and so does Gally.


                                  5.

    He rode upon a Camel's hump[106]
      Through Araby the sandy,
    Which surely must have hurt the rump
      Of this poetic dandy.
    His rhymes are of the costive kind,
      And barren as each valley
    In deserts which he left behind
      Has been the Muse of Gally.

                                  6.

    He has a Seat in Parliament,
      Is fat and passing wealthy;
    And surely he should be content
      With these and being healthy:
    But Great Ambition will misrule
      Men at all risks to sally,--
    Now makes a poet--now a fool,
      And _we_ know _which_--of Gally.

                                  7.

    Some in the playhouse like to row,
      Some with the Watch to battle,
    Exchanging many a midnight blow
      To Music of the Rattle.
    Some folks like rowing on the Thames,
      Some rowing in an Alley,
    But all the Row my fancy claims
      Is _rowing_--of my _Gally_.

    MRS. WILMOT sate scribbling a play,
      Mr. Sotheby sate sweating behind her;
    But what are all these to the Lay
      Of Gally i.o. the Grinder?
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

    I bought me some books tother day,
      And sent them down stairs to the binder;
    But the Pastry Cook carried away
      My Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  3.

    I wanted to kindle my taper,
      And called to the Maid to remind her;
    And what should she bring me for paper
      But Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  4.

    Among my researches for EASE
      I went where one's certain to find her:
    The first thing by her throne that one sees
      Is Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  5.

    Away with old Homer the blind--
      I'll show you a poet that's blinder:
    You may see him whene'er you've a mind
      In Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  6.

    Blindfold he runs groping for fame,
      And hardly knows where he will find her:
    She don't seem to take to the name
      Of Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  7.

Frenchwoman, by Rulhières, I believe."--Letter to Murray, August 12,
1819, _Letters_, 1900, iv. 346.

Claude Carloman de Rulhière (1718-1791), historian, poet, and
epigrammatist, was the author of _Anecdotes sur la revolution de Russie
en l'anneé_ 1762, _Histoire de l'anarchie de Pologne_ (1807), etc. His
epigrams are included in "Poésies Diverses," which are appended to _Les
jeux de Mains_, a poem in three cantos, published in 1808, and were
collected in his _Oeuvres Posthumes_, 1819; but there is no trace of the
original of Byron's translation. Perhaps it is _after_ de Rulhière, who
more than once epigrammatizes "Une Vieille Femme."]

    THERE'S something in a stupid ass,
      And something in a heavy dunce;
    But never since I went to school
      I heard or saw so damned a fool
    As William Wordsworth is for once.

                                  2.

    And now I've seen so great a fool
      As William Wordsworth is for once;
    I really wish that Peter Bell
      And he who wrote it were in hell,
    For writing nonsense for the nonce.

                                  4.

    He gives the perfect work to light!

Wordsworth's _Peter Bell_, inserted in a set of Byron's _Works_
presented by George W. Childs to the Drexel Institute. (From information
kindly supplied by Mr. John H. Bewley, of Buffalo, New York.)

The first edition of _Peter Bell_ appeared early in 1819, and a second
edition followed in May, 1819. In Byron's Dedication of _Marino
Faliero_, "To Baron Goethe," dated October 20, 1820 (_Poetical Works_,
1891, iv. 341), the same allusions to Sir George Beaumont, to
Wordsworth's "place in the Excise," and to his admission that _Peter
Bell_ had been withheld "for one and twenty years," occur in an omitted
paragraph first published, _Letters_, 1891, v. 101. So close a
correspondence of an unpublished fragment with a genuine document leaves
little doubt as to the composition of the "Epilogue."]

    HOW came you in Hob's pound to cool,
      My boy Hobbie O?
    Because I bade the people pull
      The House into the Lobby O.

                                  2.

    What did the House upon this call,

    They voted me to Newgate all,
      Which is an awkward Jobby O.

                                  3.

      And blackguard Hunt and Cobby O.

                                  4.

    When to the mob you make a speech,
      My boy Hobbie O,
    How do you keep without their reach
      The watch within your fobby O?

                                  8.

FOOTNOTES:

[113] [John Cam Hobhouse (1786-1869) (see _Letters_, 1898, i. 163,
_note_ 1) was committed to Newgate in December, 1819, for certain
passages in a pamphlet entitled, _A Trifling Mistake in Thomas Lord
Erskine's recent Preface_, which were voted (December 10) a breach of
privilege. He remained in prison till the dissolution on the king's
death, February 20, 1820, when he stood and was returned for
Westminster. Byron's Liberalism was intermittent, and he felt, or, as
Hobhouse thought, pretended to feel, as a Whig and an aristocrat with
regard to the free lances of the Radical party. The sole charge in this
"filthy ballad," which annoyed Hobhouse, was that he had founded a Whig
Club when he was an undergraduate at Cambridge. He assured Murray (see
his letter, November, 1820, _Letters_, vol. iv. Appendix XI. pp.
498-500) that he was not the founder of the club, and that Byron himself
was a member. "As for his Lordship's vulgar notions about the _mob_" he
adds, "they are very fit for the Poet of the _Morning Post_, and for
nobody else." There is no reason to suppose that Byron was in any way
responsible for the version as sent to the _Morning Post_.]

                [ANOTHER VERSION.]

        To the Editor of the _Morning Post_.

Sir,--A copy of verses, to the tune of '_My boy Tammy_,' are repeated
in literary circles, and said to be written by a Noble Lord of the
highest poetical fame, upon his quondam friend and annotator. My memory
does not enable me to repeat more than the first two verses quite
accurately, but the humourous spirit of the Song may be gathered from
these:--

                   1.

    Why were you put in Lob's pond,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    For telling folks to pull the House
      By the ears into the Lobby O!

                   2.

    Who are your grand Reformers now,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    There's me and BURDETT,--gentlemen,
      And Blackguards HUNT and COBBY O!

                   3.

    Have you no other friends but these,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    Yes, Southwark's Knight,[*] the County BYNG,
      And in the City, BOBBY O!

[*] "Southwark's Knight" was General Sir Robert Thomas Wilson
(1777-1849), who was returned for Southwark in 1818, and again in 1820;
"County Byng" was George Byng, M.P. for Middlesex; and "Bobby" was Sir
Robert Waithman (1764-1833), who represented the City of London in 1818,
but lost his seat to Sir William Curtis in 1820. All these were advanced
Liberals, and, as such, Parliamentary friends of Hobhouse.

                   4.

    How do you recreate yourselves,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    We spout with tavern Radicals,
      And drink with them hob-nobby O!

                   5.

    What purpose can such folly work,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    It gives our partisans a chance
      Watches to twitch from fob-by O!

                   6.

    Have they no higher game in view,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    Oh yes; to stir the people up,
      And then to head the mob-by O.

                   7.

    But sure they'll at their ruin pause,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    No! they'd see King and Parliament
      Both d--d without a sob-by O!

                   8.

    But, if they fail, they'll be hanged up,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    Why, then, they'll swing, like better men,
      And that will end the job-by O!

In a postscript to a letter to Murray, dated January 19, 1821, he
writes, "I sent you a line or two on the Braziers' Company last week,
_not_ for publication. The lines were even worthy

    'Of ----dsworth the great metaquizzical poet,
    A man of great merit amongst those who know it,
    Of whose works, as I told Moore last autumn at _Mestri_
    I owe all I know to my passion for _Pastry_.'"

He adds, in a footnote, "_Mestri_ and _Fusina_ are the ferry trajects to
Venice: I believe, however, that it was at Fusina that Moore and I
embarked in 1819, when Thomas came to Venice, like Coleridge's Spring,
'slowly up this way.'"

Again, in a letter to Moore, dated January 22, 1821, he encloses
slightly different versions of both epigrams, and it is worth noting
that the first line of the pendant epigram has been bowdlerized, and
runs thus--

    "Of Wordsworth the grand metaquizzical poet."

FOOTNOTES:

[126] [Napoleon bequeathed to Lady Holland a snuff-box which had been
given to him by the Pope for his clemency in sparing Rome. Lord Carlisle
wrote eight (not seven) stanzas, urging her, as Byron told Medwin, to
decline the gift, "for fear that horror and murder should jump out of
the lid every time it is opened."--_Conversations_, 1824, p. 362. The
first stanza of Lord Carlyle's verses, which _teste_ Medwin, Byron
parodied, runs thus--

    "Lady, reject the gift! 'tis tinged with gore!
    Those crimson spots a dreadful tale relate;
    It has been grasp'd by an infernal Power;
    And by that hand which seal'd young Enghien's fate."

          DO you know Doctor Nott?[127]

    Who seven years since tried to dish up
          A neat Codi_cil_
          To the Princess's Will,[128]
    Which made Dr. Nott _not_ a bishop.

                                  2.

          So the Doctor being found
          A little unsound
    In his doctrine, at least as a teacher,
          And kicked from one stool
          As a knave or a fool,
    He mounted another as preacher.

                                  3.

          In that Gown (like the Skin
          With no Lion within)
    He still for the Bench would be driving;
          And roareth away,
          A new Vicar of _Bray_,
    Except that _his bray_ lost his living.

                                  4.

          "Gainst Freethinkers," he roars,
          "You should all block your doors
    Or be named in the Devil's indentures:"
          And here I agree,
          For who e'er would be
    A Guest where old Simony enters?

                                  5.

          Let the Priest, who beguiled
          His own Sovereign's child
    To his own dirty views of promotion,
          Wear his Sheep's cloathing still
          Among flocks to his will,
    And dishonour the Cause of devotion.

          The Altar and Throne
          Are in danger alone
    From such as himself, who would render
          The Altar itself
          But a step up to Pelf,
    And pray God to pay his defender.

                                  7.

          But, Doctor, one word
          Which perhaps you have heard
    "He should never throw stones who has windows
          Of Glass to be broken,
          And by this same token
    As a sinner, you can't care what Sin does.

                                  8.

          But perhaps you do well:
          Your own windows, they tell,
    Have long ago sufferéd censure;
          Not a fragment remains
          Of your character's panes,
    Since the Regent refused you a glazier.

                                  9.

          Though your visions of lawn
          Have all been withdrawn,
    And you missed your bold stroke for a mitre;
          In a very snug way
          You may still preach and pray,
    And from bishop sink into backbiter!"

FOOTNOTES:

[127] [George Frederick Nott (1767-1841), critic and divine, was Rector
of Harrietsham and Woodchurch, a Prebendary of Winchester and of
Salisbury. He was Bampton Lecturer in 1802, and, soon afterwards, was
appointed sub-preceptor to the Princess Charlotte of Wales. He was a
connoisseur of architecture and painting, and passed much of his time in
Italy and at Rome. When he was at Pisa he preached in a private room in
the basement story of the house in Pisa where Shelley was living, and
fell under Byron's displeasure for attacking the Satanic school, and
denouncing _Cain_ as a blasphemous production. "The parsons," he told
Moore (letter, February 20, 1820), "preached at it [_Cain_] from Kentish
Town to Pisa." Hence the apostrophe to Dr. Nott. (See _Records of
Shelley, Byron, and the Author_, by E.T. Trelawny, 1887, pp. 302, 303.)]

[128] [According to Lady Anne Hamilton (_Secret History of the Court of
England_, 1832, i. 198-207), the Princess Charlotte incurred the
suspicion and displeasure of her uncles and her grandmother, the Queen,
by displaying an ardent and undue interest in her sub-preceptor. On
being reproved by the Queen for "condescending to favour persons in low
life with confidence or particular respect, persons likely to take
advantage of your simplicity and innocence," and having learnt that
"persons" meant Mr. Nott, she replied by threatening to sign a will in
favour of her sub-preceptor, and by actually making over to him by a
deed her library, jewels, and all other private property. Lady Anne
Hamilton is not an accurate or trustworthy authority, but her extremely
circumstantial narrative was, no doubt, an expansion of the contemporary
scandal to which Byron's lampoon gave currency.]

    I WATCHED thee when the foe was at our side,
      Ready to strike at him--or thee and me.
    Were safety hopeless--rather than divide
      Aught with one loved save love and liberty.

                                  2.

    I watched thee on the breakers, when the rock
      Received our prow and all was storm and fear,
    And bade thee cling to me through every shock;
      This arm would be thy bark, or breast thy bier.

                                  3.

    I watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes,
      Yielding my couch and stretched me on the ground,
    When overworn with watching, ne'er to rise
      From thence if thou an early grave hadst found.

                                  4.

    The earthquake came, and rocked the quivering wall,
      And men and nature reeled as if with wine.
    Whom did I seek around the tottering hall?
      For thee. Whose safety first provide for? Thine.

                                  5.

    And when convulsive throes denied my breath
      The faintest utterance to my fading thought,
    To thee--to thee--e'en in the gasp of death
      My spirit turned, oh! oftener than it ought.

                                  6.

    Thus much and more; and yet thou lov'st me not,
      And never wilt! Love dwells not in our will.
    Nor can I blame thee, though it be my lot
      To strongly, wrongly, vainly love thee still.[132]

                        LAST WORDS ON GREECE.

    WHAT are to me those honours or renown
      Past or to come, a new-born people's cry?
    Albeit for such I could despise a crown
      Of aught save laurel, or for such could die.
    I am a fool of passion, and a frown
      Of thine to me is as an adder's eye.
    To the poor bird whose pinion fluttering down
      Wafts unto death the breast it bore so high;
    Such is this maddening fascination grown,
      So strong thy magic or so weak am I.

          ON THIS DAY I COMPLETE MY THIRTY-SIXTH YEAR.[133]

                                  1.

    'T IS time this heart should be unmoved,
      Since others it hath ceased to move:
    Yet, though I cannot be beloved,
                Still let me love!

                                  2.

    My days are in the yellow leaf;
      The flowers and fruits of Love are gone;
    The worm, the canker, and the grief
      Are mine alone!


                                  3.

    The fire that on my bosom preys
      Is lone[iii] as some Volcanic isle;
    No torch is kindled at its blaze--
      A funeral pile.

                                  4.

    The hope, the fear, the jealous care,
      The exalted portion of the pain
    And power of love, I cannot share,
      But wear the chain.

                                  5.

    But 't is not _thus_--and 't is not _here_--[iv]
      Such thoughts should shake my soul, nor now
    Where Glory decks the hero's bier,[v]
      Or binds his brow.

                                  6.

    The Sword, the Banner, and the Field,[vi]
      Glory and Greece, around me see!
    The Spartan, borne upon his shield,[134]
      Was not more free.

                                  7.

    Awake! (not Greece--she _is_ awake!)
      Awake, my spirit! Think through _whom_
    Thy life-blood tracks its parent lake,[vii]
      And then strike home!

                                  8.

    Tread those reviving passions down,[viii]
      Unworthy manhood!--unto thee
    Indifferent should the smile or frown
      Of Beauty be.

                                  9.

    If thou regret'st thy youth, _why live_?
      The land of honourable death
    Is here:--up to the Field, and give
      Away thy breath!

                                 10.

    Seek out--less often sought than found--
      A soldier's grave, for thee the best;
    Then look around, and choose thy ground,
      And take thy Rest.

FOOTNOTES:

[133] ["This morning Lord Byron came from his bedroom into the apartment
where Colonel Stanhope and some friends were assembled, and said with a
smile--'You were complaining, the other day, that I never write any
poetry now:--this is my birthday, and I have just finished something,
which, I think, is better than what I usually write.' He then produced
these noble and affecting verses, which were afterwards found written in
his journals, with only the following introduction: 'Jan. 22; on this
day I complete my 36^th^ year.'"--_A Narrative of Lord Byron's Last
Journey to Greece_, 1825, p. 125, by Count Gamba. In the _Morning
Chronicle_, October 29, 1824, the lines are headed, "Lord Byron's Latest
Verses," and are prefaced by the following note: "We have been indebted
to a friend for the following immortal verses, the last he ever
composed. Four of the lines have already appeared in an article in the
_Westminster Review_" ("Lord Byron in Greece," July, 1824, vol. ii. p.
227).]

of Sir Francis Burdett (1770-1844), and are now in the possession of his
grandson, Mr. F.B. Money-Coutts.
