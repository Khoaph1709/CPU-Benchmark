Childe Harold's Pilgrimage./ A Romaunt./ By/ Lord Byron./ L'univers est
une espèce de livre, dont on n'a lu que la première page quand on n'a vu

d'autre bénéfice de mes voyages que celui-là, je n'en re/gretterais ni
les frais, ni les fatigues./ _Le Cosmopolite_./ London:/ Printed for

_Note_ (2)--Mr. S. Leicester Warren (Lord de Tabley) records the
following MS. notes inscribed in a copy of the Fifth Edition, which had
formerly belonged to James Boswell, jun., and was then in the possession
of Mr. J.R.P. Kirby, of Bloomsbury Street:--

A. A note on the abortive duel between Jeffrey and Moore is dated
November 4, 1811.

B. A note on the fly-leaf in the handwriting of James Boswell, jun.--

"This copy purports on the title-page to be the fourth edition, but is
in truth the fifth. Having pointed out to Murray, the bookseller, a
variation between the copy of the fifth edition and this, he borrowed it
from me, that he might show it to Lord Byron to have the circumstance
explained; that his lordship told him he had printed the fifth edition,
but, before its publication, having repented of the work altogether, he
determined to destroy the whole impression. But the printer, as he
observed, must have retained at least this one copy, and, by putting a
false title-page, had sold it as the fourth edition," etc.--_Notes and
Queries_, 1887, Series V. vol. vii. pp. 203, 204.

Mr. Murray's copy of the Fifth Edition contains, on the fly-leaves at
the beginning of the volume, MS. versions of (1) _The Curse of Minerva_,
pp. [i.]-[xi.]; (2) The Answer to Fitzgerald's Epigram, written at the
"Alfred," on _English Bards, etc._, p. [xv.]; and on p. xvi. the

English Bards/ and Scotch Reviewers; a/ Satire/ By Lord Byron./ I had
rather be a kitten, and cry, mew!/ Than one of these same metre
ballad-mongers./ Shakspere./ Such shameless Bards we have; and yet 'tis

Unpublished; with considerable additions./ London:/ Printed for James
Cawthorne,/ Cockspur Street./ 1812./

At the end of the volume a MS. version of "Lines on the Removing Lady
Jersey's Portrait from the Gallery of Beauties," is on pp. [85], [86],

(R. As these POEMS were never intended to meet the public eye, no
apology is necessary for the form in which they now appear. They are
printed merely for the perusal of a few friends to whom they are
dedicated; who will look upon them with indulgence; and as most of them
were composed between the age of 15 and 17, their defects will be
pardoned or forgotten, in the youth and inexperience of the WRITER.) +

_Note_ (1).--A facsimile of the Title-page (2) faces p. xii. of vol. i.
of the _Poetical Works_, 1898. It has been alleged that large-paper
copies of this edition were issued from the Newark press. It is certain
that large copies (a copy in the British Museum, cut for binding,
measures 220 X 122), printed on paper bearing a water-mark dated 1806,
were thrown upon the market at an early period, but it has not been
ascertained at what date or in what place they were printed. They are
undoubtedly deliberate forgeries. They purport, even in respect of
_errata_, to be identical with the genuine issue of 1807; but they were
not set up from the same type, and it is inconceivable that a second
issue, set up from different type and with slightly different ornaments,
was printed by Ridge for piratical purposes. To cite a few obvious
differences--in the title of the large-paper copies the first A of the
word "TRANSLATED" is printed Λ [Greek: L ], and the Greek ν [Greek: n]
in αινεε [Greek: ainee] and νεικει [Greek: neikei] appears as υ [Greek:
u] (not ν [Greek: n] reversed); in the Errata on the reverse of p.
xiii., [Page] "153 Note" is incorrectly given as "163 Note," and this
slip on the part of the _falsarius_ is more remarkable, as two other
errata in the Errata are carefully reproduced; in the Greek motto on p.
22 the letter ρ [Greek: r] twice appears as ς [Greek: s]; and, finally,
the ornaments on pp. 1 and 187, though intended to be, are not
identical. In the Museum copy a portrait of "Lord Byron, from a sketch
taken on his leaving England," engraved by I. West, and "Published by V.
Hone, Ludgate Hill, 1819," precedes the title-page, and, together with
the binding, affords good, if not conclusive, proof that this copy was
printed before 1820.

See, for a correspondence on these L.P. copies of 1807, the _Athenæum_,
June, 1898, pp. 694, 695.

See, too, for further interesting and conclusive evidence that the
ornament on p. 187 of the L.P. copies was not printed from the Newark
block, _Newark as a Publishing Town_, by T.M. Blagg, 1898, pp. 28-30.

_Note_ (2).--An autograph note, dated May 20th, 1812, signed "Byron," is
inserted on the fly-leaf of a large-paper copy in the Rowfant Library
(_Catalogue_, 1886, p. 144).

_Hints from Horace_.

_Note_.--Two sets of proofs of a portion of _Hints from Horace_,
formerly the property of R.C. Dallas, are preserved in the British
Museum (_Eg_. 2029). Proof A consists of 100 lines of the English
translation (lines 173-272); Proof B, pp. [87]-128, consists of 272
lines of the English translation (lines 1-272) and (on opposite pages)
188 lines of the original Latin. These proof-sheets, which must have
followed proofs of the Fifth Edition of _English Bards_, _etc_., are
preceded by a Half-title, _Hints from Horace_ (Gothic characters), and
by the following subsidiary title:--

Hints from Horace:/ Being a/ Partial Imitation, in English Verse, of the
Epistle,/ "Ad Pisones de Arte Poetica;"/ And intended as a Sequel to/
English Bards and Scotch Reviewers./ [Gothic characters.] "Ergo fungar
vice Cotis, acutum/ Reddere quæ ferrum valet, exsors ipsa secandi."/
Hor. De Arte Poet. 304-5./ "Rhymes are difficult things; they are
stubborn things, sir."/ Fielding's Amelia, Vol. III./ Book and Chap. V./
Athens, Franciscan Convent,/ March 12, 1811./

The publication of _Hints from Horace_ had been entrusted by Dallas to
Cawthorn in July-August, 1811. It may be gathered from various sources
(_Letters_, 1898, ii. 24, 54, 56) that Byron was at work on the proofs
as late as September 4; that by October 11 he had resolved to defer the
publication of the _Hints_; and that, accordingly on October 13, 1811,
"they stood still." It was not, however, till after the appearance of
_Childe Harold's_, _etc_. (May-June, 1812) that Byron determined to
suppress the already printed Fifth Edition of _English Bards_, and at
the same time to abandon the publication of his two other Satires. At
this time, says Dallas (_Recollections of the Life of Lord Byron_, 1898,
p. 241), "the _Hints from Horace_ was far advanced." In his
_Recollections, etc_. (pp. 104-113), he gives, by way of a "fair
specimen," 156 "lines of the still-unpublished poem; and, as these
extracts are taken from the first 211 lines, and his text corresponds
with proof B (see Poetical Works, 1898, i. 390, variants ii., iii.), it
may be inferred that Dallas transcribed them from his fragmentary
proof-sheets, and that the press was stopped at line 272. In 1830, in
his _Notices of the Life of Lord Byron_ (vol. i. pp. 263-269), Moore
printed 165 lines of the "Paraphrase;" but his selections are drawn from
lines 1-458, and it is evident that he had access to an original MS.
(_MS. M._), which is now in Mr. Murray's possession. The full text,
which follows the same MS., was first published in vol. v. pp. 273-327
of the six-volume edition of 1831 (_vide ante_, No. xliii. of "Collected
Editions").


_The Irish Avatar_.

Byron wrote the _Irish Avatar_ at Ravenna, September 16, 1821. On the
17th he sent a copy of the verses to Moore, then resident at Paris; and
on September 20 he desired Moore to get "twenty copies of the whole
carefully and privately printed off." A copy is in the possession of Mr.
H. Buxton Forman, C.B., and I am indebted to his kindness for the
following description: "The pamphlet consists of four 8vo leaves, viz.
half-title ('The Irish Avatar,' in bold capitals, with blank verse), pp.
[1], [2] + Text, pp. 3-8. The poem begins on the third page with a
dropped head, 'The Irish Avatar' again, and the first four verses. Pp.
4-7 contain six verses each, and p. 8 the remaining four, making up
thirty-two in all. The date at the end of p. 8 is 'September 16, 1821.'
There is no title-page proper; a headline, 'The Irish Avatar,' occurs on
pp. 4-8, which pages are numbered in Arabic figures in the outside
corners, and the thirty-two stanzas are also numbered in Arabic figures.
The poem is printed on a half-sheet of a peculiar fine-ribbed paper."
Twenty stanzas of _The Irish Avatar_ were printed by Medwin in
_Conversations of Lord Byron_, 1824, pp. 216-220, and in a second
edition, 1824, pp. 332-338. In a "new edition" of the _Conversations,
etc._, 1824, pp. 264-270, the entire poem, numbering thirty-two stanzas,
was published for the first time in England (see _Athenæum_, July 27,
1901). _The Irish Avatar_ was first published by Murray in 1831 (Works,
vi. 419-425).

_Note_.--I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Leonard L. Mackall, of
Berlin, for the substance of the following note on this work:--

"Pages 213-233 of the Anmerkungen" are devoted to an essay on the play
as a whole. This essay is evidently the "Appendix to an English Work,"
to which Byron refers in the letter accompanying the suppressed
Dedication to _Marino Faliero_. "In the Appendix to an English Work,
lately translated into German, and published at Leipzig, a judgment of
yours upon English poetry is quoted as follows: 'That in English poetry
great genius, universal power, a feeling of profundity, with sufficient
tenderness and force are to be found, but that altogether these do not
constitute poets,'" etc., etc. (see _Poetical Works_, 1901, v. 340, 341,
and _Letters_, 1900, v. 100-103). The originals of the Dedication and
Letters were conveyed to Goethe by John Murray the third, in 1830 (?
1831) (see _Goethe-Jahrbuch_, 1899, xx. pp. 31-35, where the
"Dedication" is printed in full for the first time), and are preserved
at Weimar in the "red portfolio" (cf. _Eckermann_, March 26, 1826), in
which Goethe kept all his papers connected with Byron. The "judgments"
quoted by Byron through "an Italian abstract" from Wagner's Appendix
(pp. 217-218) there read _inaccurately_ as follows: "In der Englischen
Poesie," sagt Goethe, "man findet durchaus einen grossen, tüchtigen,
weltgeübten Verstand, ein tiefes, zartes, Gemüth, ein vortreffliches
Wollen, ein leidenschaftliches Wirken ... das alles zuzammengenommen
macht noch keinen Poeten ... nach dieser Ansicht zeigen die meisten
Englischen Gedichte einen düstern Ueberdruss des Lebens." These
sentences, which should be read in the light of the context, will be
found in Goethe's _Dichtung und Wahrheit_, Th. iii. Buch. 13 (1814, now
Wirke, Weimar ed. xxviii. 213, 214), the book (_Aus meinem Leben,
Dichtung und Wahrheit_), which is held up to ridicule in the _Edinburgh
Review_, June, 1816, vol. xxvi. pp. 304-317.

The following note was attached to the "Dedication" which was prefixed
to the First Canto in 1833 (_Works_, 1833, xv. 101):--

"Note(1). [This 'Dedication' was suppressed in 1819, with Lord Byron's
reluctant consent; but, shortly after his death, its existence became
notorious, in consequence of an article in the _Westminster Review_,
generally ascribed to Sir John Hobhouse, and for several years the
verses have been selling in the streets as a broadside. It could
therefore serve no purpose to exclude them on the present occasion.]"
See, too, _Poetical Works_, 1903, vi. 3.

Wilson,/Royal Exchange./ 1833./' On the verso of this is a note--

"'[_Why the following Dedication did not appear with the two first
published Cantos of the Poem cannot be explained--unless the connection

"The first page of the Text (p. 5, but not numbered) contains the

NOTES.


_Note_ (1).--ON GENUINE AND SPURIOUS ISSUES OF "ENGLISH BARDS, AND
SCOTCH REVIEWERS."

Among the first who called attention to the "inextricable tangle" of the
several editions of _English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers_ was Mr.
Leicester Warren, better known as Lord de Tabley, who communicated some
notes in 1877 to _Notes and Queries_ (Series V. vol. vii. pp. 145,
etc.); but it was reserved to the late Mr. Dykes Campbell, Mr. Bertram
Dobell, and other correspondents to the _Athenæum_ (May 5 to July 7,
1894), to point out that the problem was still farther complicated by
the existence of spurious issues of at least three out of the five or
six distinct editions of the Satire.

All editions, genuine or spurious, claim as their publisher "James
Cawthorn, British Library, No. 24 Cockspur Street," but different
printers were employed. The First Edition bears the imprint of "T.
Collins, Printer, No. 1, Harvey's Buildings, Strand;" the Second
Edition, that of "Deans and Co. Hart Street, Covent Garden;" the Third
Edition, that of "T. Collins," etc.; the Fourth Edition of 1810, that of
"T. Collins," etc.; the Fourth Edition of 1811 ("James Cawthorn and
Sharpe and Hailes"), that of "Cox, Son, and Baylis, Great Queen Street,
London." No printer's name was attached to the suppressed Fifth Edition
of 1812.

Genuine First Editions have the water-mark, "E. and P. 1804," or "E. and
P. 1805," or, possibly, no water-mark at all. A copy of the spurious
First Edition, in Mr. Murray's possession, has the water-mark, "S. and
C. Wise, 1812." In addition to at least eleven variants in punctuation,
the spurious copy prints (p. 5, line 47) "Wizzard" (p. 20 _n_.),
"M_e_deira," and, in the same note, "Anna d'Afert;" whereas the genuine
copies print correctly "Wizard," "Madeira," and "Anna d'Arfet."

A genuine copy of the Second Edition, which belonged to the late Mr.
Dykes Campbell, bears the water-mark "Budgen and Willmot, 1808." On p.
80, line 1007, "Abedeen" is misprinted for "Aberdeen;" and the same
misprint occurs in a copy of the Second Edition in the British Museum.
In all probability there was no spurious issue of the Second Edition.

Of the Third Edition (1810), copies bearing the water-mark, "E.&P.
1804," or "G.&R.T.," may be regarded as genuine--rare exceptions among a
host of forgeries which either lack a water-mark altogether or bear
water-marks of a later period. Mr. Gilbert R. Redgrave, in an article
(_The Library_, December 1, 1899, Series II. vol. i. pp. 18-25), notes
two distinct and divergent forgeries bearing the water-mark "Pine, and
Thomas, 1812." Forgery A prints "myse" for "muse" (line 4), "rove" for
"rave" (line 384), etc.; while forgery B, in a footnote to p. 30, prints
"Bowle'ss" for "Bowles's," and, at the end of p. 85, "we" for "me," and
"farther" for "further." Other copies bear the water-marks, "Allnutt,
1816," "Smith & Allnutt, 1816," "Ivy Mills, 1817," and "I.&R. Ansell,
1818." A copy of a spurious issue of the Third Edition in the British
Museum prints "crawl" for "scrawl" (line 47), and "p. 73" for "p. 85."

It has been surmised, but conclusive proof is not forthcoming, that a
so-called Fourth Edition of 1810 (1050 lines), which purports to have
been published by James Cawthorn, and bears the imprint, "_Printed by J.
Collins, Harvey's Buildings, Strand, London_," is a spurious issue. It
is practically a reprint of the Third Edition; but in some copies there
are misprints not to be found in other piracies--_e.g._ "crouds" for
"crowds" (line 269), and "alter" for "altar"(line 285).

Copies of the Fourth Edition of 1810, which may possibly be genuine,
bear a water-mark, "G.&R.T.," or are on plain paper. Copies which are
manifestly forgeries bear the water-marks, "J.X. 1810" and "W.
Pickering, 1816."

A second Fourth Edition (1052 lines), published by "James Cawthorn and
Sharp & Hailes, 1811," and printed by "Cox, Son, & Baylis," was
certainly recognized by Byron as a genuine Fourth Edition, and must have
passed through his hands, or been subject to his emendation, before it
was sent to press. Copies of this edition bear his MS. emendations of
1811-1812, and marginal notes of 1816. Genuine copies (_e.g._ Leigh
Hunt's copy, now in the Forster Collection at the South Kensington
Museum) are printed on paper bearing a water-mark, "J. Whatman, 1805."
There was, however, another issue of the Fourth Edition of 1811, printed
on plain paper. Mr. Redgrave notes certain minute differences between
these two issues. In the edition on plain paper there is a hyphen to
"Cockspur-Street" on the title-page, and the word "Street" is followed
by a comma instead of a semicolon. Again, in the plain-paper copies
"Lambe" is spelt with an _e_, and in the water-mark copies the word is
correctly spelt "Lamb." In the plain-paper copies the misprint
"Postcript" for "Postscript" is repeated, and in the copies bearing a
water-mark the word is correctly spelt "Postscript." There are other
differences in the advertisements at the end of the volume.

A spurious Fourth Edition in Mr. Murray's possession, which has been
enriched with a series of prints of persons and places, bears the
water-marks, "1811," "1814." Each page has been inserted into a folio
sheet bearing the water-mark, "J. Whatman, 1816." A full-sized octavo,
in small print (B.M. 11645 P. 15), which purports to be the Fourth
Edition of 1811, is probably spurious. It is the survival of a distinct
issue from other genuine or spurious copies of the Fourth Edition.

The spurious issues of the Third and Fourth Editions, whether they were
printed in Ireland or were secretly thrown upon the market by James
Cawthorn after Byron had definitely selected Murray as his publisher,
were designed for the general reader and not for the collector. The
issue of a spurious First Edition after the improved and enlarged
editions of 1809-11 were published, must have been designed for the
Byron enthusiast, if not the collector of First Editions.

The Grangerized Fourth Editions prepared by Mr. W.M. Tartt and Mr. Evans
in 1819, 1820, and a Third, by John Murray at about the same period,
and, more remarkable still, a copy of the Fourth Edition of 1811,
prefaced by a specially printed "List of Names mentioned in the _English
Bards, and Scotch Reviewers_" interleaved with the additions made in the
Fifth Edition (B.M.), point to the existence of a circle of worshippers
who were prepared to treat Byron's _Juvenilia_ as seriously as the
minute critics of the present generation. They seem to have been
sufficiently numerous to make piracy, if not forgery, profitable.

_Note_ (3).--THE ANNOTATED COPIES OF THE FOURTH EDITION OF 1811.

Two annotated copies of the genuine Fourth Edition of _English Bards,
etc._ [1811], with MS. corrections in Byron's handwriting, are
extant--one in Mr. Murray's possession, and a second in the Forster
Library at the South Kensington Museum. The former, which contains the
marginal comments marked "B. 1816," has been assumed to have been
prepared as a press copy for the Fifth Edition; but, as the following
collation reveals, the latter, which belonged to Leigh Hunt, represents
a fuller and later, though not a final revision. The half-title bears
the inscription, "Byron, Dec. 31^st^, 1811. N--d. A^y [_i.e._ Newstead
Abbey] B.

    "_Dum relego--scripsisse pudet--quia plurima cerno--
    Me quoque--qui feci--judice digna lini_--B. J^y 20, 1812."

and the verso the words, "Given me by the author on my birthday, Oct.
19, 1815. Leigh Hunt."

             u
P. 5. ingen(-i-)ous. [The misprint is a note of a genuine copy.]

Lines 173, 174.

    (-Low may they sink to merited contempt-)
    (-And scorn remunerate the mean attempt.-)

    Still for stern Mammon may they toil in vain,
    And sadly gaze on Gold they cannot gain.

[This emendation is not given in the Murray copy.]

Lines 257, 258.

    So
  (-How-) well the subject suits his noble mind!
  (-"A fellow feeling makes us wond'rous kind,"-)
  He brays the Laureat of the long-eared kind!

[The Murray copy, which amends line 258 as above, leaves the "How"
unerased, but the Fifth Edition prints "So."]

Lines 323-328.

  And shows, (-dissolved in thine own tears-).
             still whimpering through threescore years.
  (-Whether in sighing-winds thou seek'st relief,-)
  (-Or consolation in a yellow leaf.-)
  Whether in equal strains thou vent'st thy grief
  O'er falling Empires or a yellow leaf.

[The Murray copy gives no emendation. The Fifth Edition adopts the first
correction, but, for the variant in lines 327, 328, reads--

  Whether thou sing'st with equal ease and grief
  The fall of Empires or a yellow leaf.]

Line 336.      All love thy (-strain-)
                               rhyme

Line 385.      Fresh fish from (-Helicon-)
                               Hippocrene

[The Murray copy adds a note: "The Fifth Edition reads Hippocrene."]

Lines 387, 388.

  (-Too much in turtle Bristol's sons delight,-)
  (-Too much o'er bowls of Rack prolong the night.-)
  Your turtle-feeder's verse must needs be flat,
  Though Bristol bloat him with the verdant fat.

[The Murray copy does not contain this emendation, which was adopted in
the Fifth Edition.

P. 36 _n._ The Hunt copy gives in MS. the note concerning Moore--"I am
informed," etc.--which is printed in the Fifth Edition. There is no
similar annotation in the Murray copy.

Line 502. For (-"ranks illustrious"-) both annotated copies read
"oat-fed phalanx."]

Lines 532, 533.

  And grateful (-to the founder of the feast,-)
  Declare his landlord (-can translate, at least.-)
  And grateful for the dainties on his plate,
  Declare his landlord can at least translate.

[The amended lines, which appeared in the Fifth Edition, are not in the
Murray copy.]

Lines 552, 553.

  While Kenny's World (-just suffered to proceed,-)
  (-Proclaims the audience very kind indeed.-)
  While Kenny's World--ah where is Kenny's wit?
                                     listless
  Tires the sad Gallery--lulls the (-listening-) pit.

[The emendation is given in both annotated copies; but the substitution
of "listless" for "listening," which is adopted in the Fifth Edition,
does not appear in the Murray copy,]

Line 563.       Let Comedy (-re-)sume
                             ass

[The correction is not given in the Murray copy.]

Line 569.       and (-Kemble-) lives to tread.
                      Siddons

[The substitution of "Siddons" for "Kemble," which dates from the Fifth
Edition, is not given in the Murray copy.]

Line 728.

  Want your (-defence-), let Pity be your screen
               plea
  Want is your plea, let Pity be your screen.

Lines 815, 816.

  The spoiler (-came; and all thy promise fair-)
  (-Has sought the grave, to sleep for ever there.-)
  The Spoiler swept that soaring Lyre away,
  Which she had sounded an immortal lay.

[The emendation appears in both the annotated copies.]

L. 903.        Let Moore (-be lewd-)
                         still sigh

[This emendation does not appear in the Murray copy, but the words ["be
lewd"] have been underscored with a pencil, and a X placed against
them.]

Line 946.

  (-And even spurns the great Scatonian prize.-)
  Even from the tempting ore of Seaton's prize.

[This emendation is given in both the annotated copies.]

Lines 965, 966.

  So sunk in dullness (-and so lost in shame-)
  (-That SMYTHE and HODGSON scarce redeem thy fame.-)
  So sunk in dullness that nor Hodgson's verse
  Can make thee better--nor poor Hewson's worse.

[This emendation is not in the Murray copy. The Fifth Edition adopts the
further correction, "So lost to Phoebus" for "So sunk in dullness."]

Line 969.       (-"is-) wove,
                  she wove.

[This correction is not in the Murray copy.]

Line 972.       ----(-justly praise-) their sires.
                ----glory in their sires.

[This emendation is not given in the Murray copy.

The Leigh Hunt copy gives twenty MS. emendations (besides "Death" for
"death," in line 820, and the alteration of "rapid" to "rabid" in the
note on Hewson Clarke, line 962) including the note on Moore. The Murray
copy gives nine MS. emendations, of which six are identical with those
in the Hunt copy. Three emendations are peculiar to the Murray copy--]

(1) Lines 303-306.
          Behold!--ye tarts! etc. (_vide ante_, p. 309).

(2) Line 614.    (-Raise-) not your scythe.
                  Whet not your scythe.

(3) Line 661.     ----"(-a Paget-) for your wife.
                  ----two Pagets for your wife.
